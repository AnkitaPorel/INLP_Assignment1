<UNK> to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . 1761.0841048715572
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr . Bingley ? " " When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . 1144.9325464072592
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its <UNK> was visiting and news . 1830.1278499576074
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 1604.0529080422953
Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 1978.8305693747022
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back . 857.3268399124322
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law . " The loss of her daughter made Mrs . 1386.2545359283422
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 1233.0438769376506
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <UNK> her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 2148.2847605489505
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more . 936.4923952844658
He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 1662.1154555425617
" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister . 1419.9113468015294
He was full of joy and attention . 621.010437378624
But do not imagine that he is always here so often . 983.7764274969882
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 482.3820012953175
Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend . 902.7901932808547
CHAPTER XIX . 237.11669479662504
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 2281.4777876434014
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . 1499.1154027774787
What are men to <UNK> and mountains ? 1330.72554846272
What is your own opinion ? " " That it ought not to be attempted . 1014.2083627368837
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the <UNK> . 2391.634024938765
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 1999.6777431162188
" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . 741.924777394766
It was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch street by noon . 1344.4764860041753
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid . 2117.313587651942
" When my eyes were opened to his real character . Oh ! 872.2602742195428
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 2110.582412024575
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 1628.55398648796
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 1125.1204550553214
" You may well warn me against such an evil . 780.6861753227556
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 2453.924285497706
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 2089.515554205037
The Foundation ' s principal office is located at <UNK> Dr . S . 1391.8237551211027
Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with <UNK> civility that they were perfectly needless . 1144.4029934529303
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of <UNK> was delightful to her , and she began her song . 2199.7924531150147
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . 1174.15466564582
Yes , I call it a very easy distance . " " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth . 1063.4640047835942
<UNK> are too much like <UNK> . 2160.8406272525995
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? 1607.4196934724564
Elizabeth <UNK> the next morning to the same thoughts and <UNK> which had at length closed her eyes . 1780.069146290352
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . 1895.1709418450532
Pray do not talk of that odious man . 1224.3408283380502
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley . 1227.5672404978613
" Where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door . 969.650578219579
The time fixed for the beginning of their <UNK> tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . 1752.0606751724217
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 1514.824442460043
Her answer was warmly in his favour . 897.9714703767673
<UNK> nature is so prone to fall into it ! 1967.9189966470333
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . 1560.6958771955285
" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . " " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . " Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . 1547.353129714071
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . 965.569666862974
Most people start at our Web site which has the <UNK> <UNK> search <UNK> www . gutenberg . org This Web site <UNK> information about Project Gutenberg tm , including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation , how to help produce our new eBooks , and how to <UNK> to our <UNK> <UNK> to hear about new eBooks . 2708.9143975005677
The <UNK> of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . 1314.0452096869462
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 1886.261842272896
I would keep a pack of <UNK> , and drink a bottle of wine every day . " " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . 1241.4448470888053
His surprise was great . 510.2864600546387
Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . 1278.4533887626203
I knew you would be wishing me joy . " " Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . 1302.6314205684143
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . 1906.7404621550102
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so <UNK> ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and <UNK> , " Let me call your maid . 1963.6557143444384
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 1667.153529828391
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 1478.1543238685922
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? " " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . " " Oh ! 1119.0532989318633
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . " " Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> . 2113.250318078509
I shall see her in January . 566.5985869827742
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him . 1754.4102348819238
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 2074.17383592689
Good bye . 470.02955165001725
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished <UNK> of integrity or benevolence , that might <UNK> him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the <UNK> of virtue , atone for those <UNK> errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . 2347.0308633140435
She is quite a little creature . 622.3669278280794
She represented to him all the <UNK> of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . 1527.6054285084572
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . 1491.0439018984832
Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father . 2053.0168337655546
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 1981.3055520240925
Thank Heaven ! 396.78424830594076
She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . 1713.432529229502
To the civil enquiries which then <UNK> in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer . 1182.3038055682248
Who should suffer but myself ? 1052.925020819114
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . " " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth <UNK> ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy ' s steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself . " " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a <UNK> . 1632.9159937722952
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 850.1470701543501
He <UNK> , and <UNK> , and makes love to us all . 1652.8374672468697
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . 2533.720463718885
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . 1905.6162791656905
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 1510.9259543583648
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . 1283.876679597184
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very <UNK> <UNK> for Netherfield were got by <UNK> . 2839.5031216274765
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 1880.6449970265735
Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . 1074.7714246205544
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . 2100.753635887355
They were within twenty <UNK> of each other , and so <UNK> was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . 1369.694329895641

Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 2368.7281697889443
Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> . 2151.2278048351604
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder . 1771.730482325698
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 1948.241137531174
A thousand things may arise in six months ! " The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . 1934.7869275133176
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . 955.2912983638065
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " I never heard that it was . " " And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . 1128.9899714717903
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . 1262.8744509411342
But , really , I know not what to say . 598.0383579971818
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Mr . Robinson . " " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? 1965.342953355762
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 1209.8240383540829
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uncle Philips , <UNK> <UNK> wine , who followed them into the room . 2098.488753099989
Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . " Then addressing her daughter , " Oh ! 1179.758064108205
<UNK> such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not <UNK> the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . 1935.0347633357715

Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? 1516.300507536683
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 1823.7098415201626
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . " " <UNK> their income ! 1865.8577001754254
I cannot quite agree with you there . 644.433299952421
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 2174.597444770386
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 2065.254358844163
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . " The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . 1518.2473757839487

In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . 1367.9683924663207
" Good gracious ! " cried Mrs . 240.99836244078125
At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! 2143.4186478329043
With <UNK> tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of <UNK> that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . 1741.8727786942266
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his <UNK> to myself . 2266.95982368365
They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . 1128.852378609669
She is almost three and twenty ! 550.4001922524225
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . 1910.8556434545494

Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night . 2022.71986251101
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my <UNK> on your privilege of universal good will . 2211.627636713223
why did she come ? 978.3369181885269
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her <UNK> , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . 1623.352773689705
My affections and wishes are <UNK> , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . " Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very <UNK> , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . 2546.4269811915087
He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father ' s intentions . 2094.240897281954
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . " " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . 1859.3105875251103
It was gratitude . <UNK> , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <UNK> and <UNK> of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 2370.7447033481294
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can ' t write ; so I will <UNK> , and you write for me . 1160.1706262435093
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . 1742.864350421623
I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! 1404.027904370372
This cannot be ! engaged to Mr . Darcy ! 523.3101425805214
There is a <UNK> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . 1613.3666338832982
What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! 1049.9893968687088
Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! Yes certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . " And <UNK> her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma ' am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr . Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . 1967.6771432859846
But in what <UNK> it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . 1719.6794670512809
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long <UNK> . " Mrs . 1502.7215751755725
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . 1514.8509832618129
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . 1676.8982893183875
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . 1835.318482813835
I do think Mrs . 155.60897936797903
The adieu is <UNK> itself . 836.0630062091451
They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! 1747.603429676985
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . 2008.0756965292453
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . 2303.7539809194755
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . 900.3913378306198
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . 861.3124069092423
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . 1783.5837521537437
His plan did not vary on seeing them . Miss Bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his <UNK> notions of what was due to <UNK> ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice . 2519.0199558051063
Philips first brought her the news . " Well , so much the better . 1188.770828461815
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> . 2357.46406561679
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away . 1246.1528307225572
Lydia , my love , ring the bell . 1076.92042351186
" I see what you are feeling , " replied Charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to marry you . 1163.3129385411582
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 1335.9190946605434
I send no compliments to your mother . 706.7846883316164
" How <UNK> have I acted ! " she cried . " I , who have <UNK> myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! 2004.6893920581547
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good <UNK> will <UNK> it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth <UNK> lest her mother should be exposing herself again . 2246.8100259157504
Make haste , make haste . 1001.0134066363802
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 1010.5493978315346
Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 1207.6739423412382
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 2232.792036628149
I thank you for explaining it so fully . 845.7482844629573
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . 1050.8538013126863
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that <UNK> is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . 1681.5513404670946
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . 1728.178396437704
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! 1765.4254801737075
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 1731.1565505005938
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . " Elizabeth was distressed . 1040.4275948193654
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . 1057.890374273505
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . 2049.027698960853
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <UNK> , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room . 1686.9861407653639
She will be taken good care of . 668.6255440999963
There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . 1356.414898682701
She <UNK> from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . 1773.8554467217657
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 1802.1157328331396
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <UNK> on such a research ; in which <UNK> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally <UNK> , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . 2782.8743333402376
<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 1489.588057880635
Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently . 459.7262401223973
Make haste , and come down this moment . " Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . 2185.8592143903384
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . 1334.8630488172957
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? 1129.9913464294227
When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs . 663.2259126078897
I enquired after their brother , of course . 740.7038429231544
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 391.75070299508997
that he had <UNK> his <UNK> in the first dance ! " " Oh ! 959.904780678228
Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an <UNK> sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she <UNK> him . 1709.4039548476894
It is what every body says . 528.7888916981617
" It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . 1413.5965337883758
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . 1930.7311103459465
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . 1014.5953872158161
<UNK> rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG tm concept and trademark . 2174.1738895500703
I speak <UNK> . 502.93865615644927
so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to every body . That is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . " " Did Charlotte dine with you ? " " No , she would go home . 1945.6765762752939
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 1521.536360030757
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 1796.8618700719535
" It may perhaps be pleasant , " replied Charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . 1406.3285982976372
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <UNK> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . 1542.4713818183868
Then pray speak aloud . 938.6218476468545
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two <UNK> with Jane again , and the two <UNK> with Lizzy , and the <UNK> " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! 1813.3479604655836
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . " " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . " " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . 1312.3008800797768
how acutely did she now feel it . 819.1043879503344
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . 1887.5691645457302
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and <UNK> them up , though as she never came without <UNK> some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or <UNK> , she seldom went away without leaving them more <UNK> than she found them . 2545.0061331555917
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . 1400.1855573323246
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . 2058.013031824325
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . 1425.4569524363092
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a <UNK> kind of a little <UNK> on one side of your lawn . 1972.7234856847988
We dressed up <UNK> in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! 2152.0235831627724
Bennet was <UNK> the fire . 680.4884795501656
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare <UNK> to listen to . 2508.304469101381
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 597.125379251877
Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . 712.7584749352168
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and <UNK> way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to morrow evening . 1848.8706233882692
<UNK> was the least of her feelings on this developement . 1814.6971269822475
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . 2472.0774144309617
On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a <UNK> , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy . 1969.9320620002172
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to <UNK> her confidence in it . 1607.7422529702853
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . 1664.9223043967083
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 1288.4560126059268
Till this moment , I never knew myself . " From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . 1719.3921589653085
" I did not know that you intended to walk , " said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . 914.9474614077742
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 1457.3852657307214
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . 754.1911795840623
" Excuse my interference . It was kindly meant . " " <UNK> girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . 1669.5275201496568
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . " " But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . " " Let me be rightly understood . 1567.0261375397624
But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . 1227.0847768291312
Your ' s , c . " Mr . Darcy ' s letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last . 954.767619736405
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . 934.2582659812444
But she is perfectly amiable , and often <UNK> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . " " Has she been presented ? 1798.7684326889223
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? 1394.080054209659
" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . 1377.560144790062
How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! 1375.2700845444404
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 2075.7134069782956
" She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . 1220.8145609533403
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas . 732.3673026831292
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . " Mr . Bingley followed his advice . 1519.5466074091298
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 2213.0783824995883
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard . 1771.7084042803588
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . " " I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice . 1082.2186002200494
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the <UNK> of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . 1671.2351346680512
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . 1192.090186579668
Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 1422.5635986277612
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 1847.1506875910313
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 1725.152121078292
But though every thing seemed <UNK> and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <UNK> ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . 2150.084729299758
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 1996.4087356766086
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . 954.9107484734349
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . " " Are you quite sure , Ma ' am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said Jane . " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . " " Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . " " Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . 1578.9499569443383
But here he was set right by Mrs . 568.101549179457
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said . 1930.6183683721972
What did Colonel Forster say ? 743.8906864309587
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . 1748.9696649906703
<UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> . 2560.6861509361834
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . 1174.1131565747946
Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <UNK> and <UNK> father ; and though he belonged to one of the <UNK> , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 2038.1522521213394
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . 1380.9747063483373
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 1126.9277323153483
. 90.17254300020709
<UNK> are settled so <UNK> . " " You <UNK> perhaps to the entail of this estate . " " Ah ! 1544.1448479113812
Jane now came up . 629.3201019019466
You provide , in accordance with paragraph . F . , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and <UNK> to you within days of receipt of the work . 2308.868954163978
I shall <UNK> it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . " And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh ! 1639.3789041933046
And what sort of young lady is she ? 907.2153743031826
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " With such kind of <UNK> of their parties and good <UNK> , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . 2449.679991537996
He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , <UNK> friend . 874.728181777808
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 1354.8405569114257
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 945.6611081383553
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . 1699.3224687713098
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I <UNK> believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . 2392.7590903761907
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s . 786.2831932076448
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than <UNK> . 1552.4998177373823
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat <UNK> attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must <UNK> every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <UNK> . 2384.6175025248394
" And is this all ? " cried Elizabeth . 446.47012510655026
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . 1467.6035995844927
If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession . 1187.7672829642572
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . 1856.4935085511063
One must speak a little , you know . 846.2370144628261
The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . 1213.03477237064
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . 2269.6683173372758
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . 2133.27288082832
That is all settled . " " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . 1213.8868540746248
Collins was settled near her family . " " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . 902.0747520561494
It <UNK> me . 375.83332706884715
It <UNK> because of the efforts of <UNK> of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life . 2194.223770786883
But it is of small importance . " " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and <UNK> me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? 1921.1526618697167
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton . 1753.7873788555503
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious <UNK> , denoted a recollection of Jane , not <UNK> by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . 2320.324541652723
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> . 2250.184418171616
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 2206.4572282215577
Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley <UNK> with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . 1912.8377131269729
Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> . 978.0696133476137
I shall be back by dinner . " " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . 1557.2981663582677
He knows where we live . 685.3842246323198
Bennet <UNK> the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . 1338.0799127030593
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 963.6472287911363
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they <UNK> with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy . 1778.6330672515744
We were married , you know , at St . <UNK> ' s , because Wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish . 1512.648423436355
The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . 2256.1796996282915
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . 675.2835435666219
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
There was another reason too for her opposition . 988.9262383910296
The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . 1922.8769384800123
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . " " I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . " " Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . " " That is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . 1183.0784896807186
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self importance and humility . 2541.7710107664875
" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet ' s manor . 1015.91139695254
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . " " I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which <UNK> in <UNK> a respectable man . 1881.3195585517021
It <UNK> me , I confess ; for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . 1843.0215147119857
Her own thoughts were <UNK> her . 787.4812101727064
But however he did not . 358.40731604753205
Long has promised to introduce him . " " I do not believe Mrs . 430.4379730026714
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 1781.7373432173065
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 1164.9788129067963
" This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! 1350.159142887341
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of <UNK> to others . 2060.7963987382504
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 1873.7895044903726
Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar . 1718.9949698413343
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 1535.3931162067086
By you , I was properly humbled . 934.6919739341918
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a <UNK> library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read <UNK> . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose <UNK> ' s <UNK> . 2473.0003863543625
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . 1011.1083901577882
His doing so drew her notice . 809.6027838312323
But your family owe me nothing . 678.5263676895142
<UNK> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 1621.8455557551777
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " Oh ! 1433.2876097481017
good or bad ? " " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . 1646.7701118954178
They could describe an entertainment with <UNK> , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . 2077.03498368021
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . 909.6735693121353
Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . 1411.2678782979572
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . 947.812265069837
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . 1816.7687946104236
I am sure my sisters must all envy me . 515.3975046636311
And when you have given your ball , " she added , " I shall insist on their giving one also . 1058.190326830616
It will pass away soon enough . " " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty . 1287.5163251367019
how can it affect them ? " " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! 909.7447301517218
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . 1676.0698949528298
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . 1222.038847585142
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . 1265.6871179123063
There was no want of discourse . 614.9207529979791
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long . 1124.3991448159738
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . 954.8231245117912
and to see dear Wickham too ! 1063.7395591408874
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . 851.6733180519445
Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . 2552.3745297285086
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity . 1967.1815562133218
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 1989.6092722320177
Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her . 746.4502853106193
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 1181.0481811134953
I am sure you will be very comfortable there . 387.9634603200374
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . 998.6193634803681
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ' s beauty . 1511.6912680532503
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , <UNK> against the <UNK> conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . 2500.926499839668
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten . 2029.8020841089663
I will read it to you " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles <UNK> to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <UNK> <UNK> . 2287.8139257464086
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man . 2186.979545009517
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . 1648.7474290122473
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy . 2319.422577151655
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . 1849.8401968523074
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 1936.761379832512
" How strange this is ! 473.48106138756646
I am not to be <UNK> into anything so wholly unreasonable . 788.3567474758437
do not repeat what I then said . 1253.8801549435768
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . " " Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . 1456.2557840508134
Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to <UNK> . 1483.8585131013228
Society has claims on us all ; and I <UNK> myself one of those who consider intervals of <UNK> and amusement as desirable for every body . " Elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak <UNK> to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from <UNK> a <UNK> either from the <UNK> , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by <UNK> to dance . 1917.1342077762613
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1521.9234349674707
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 1277.983176190152
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins . 1287.6967207434868
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . 1892.7200688655478
Mr . Bennet protested against any description of finery . 667.6838096250332
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday . 2288.1537318492306
" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . 1285.901556276455
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <UNK> silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <UNK> between them again . 2133.507428812799
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 1536.1883784060917
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 1461.321896977586
only think ! 688.57140896292
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you . 1537.5155312019294
She is well , and <UNK> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . Your ' s , c . 1297.5491741194944
" Oh ! 42.46667514260318
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . 1757.150504378224
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . 1665.93242006237
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . 1295.1651383668902
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 2352.35393881102
shocking ! " cried Miss Bingley . 639.2900534382844
<UNK> my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . 1722.7360232087394
Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . 963.8970335425851
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 1389.8843299821565
Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed . 1253.6498890640798
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , <UNK> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 2067.4605838491198
They came . 257.07947426273915
She could not <UNK> him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . 1313.032680378763
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . 2328.1186779804757
CHAPTER XIX . 237.11669479662504
Though our kind uncle has done something towards <UNK> him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . 2031.7901705107256
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 2123.5307346233026
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him . 1079.8730550119267
A <UNK> life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . 2222.9378717973946
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and <UNK> mercenary ; and the <UNK> of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to <UNK> at any thing . 2466.473900185485
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! 1615.8275183156195
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . 1067.3412485094395
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 1288.0871125581618
What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . 1297.7317422422761
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . 1939.6919039048116
Mr . Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . 1760.7036358716052
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 1583.7625110598517
If this be the case , he deserves you . 813.9370899785646
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <UNK> . 1646.765861471528
Mr . Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . 805.8747428439178
She declared her resolution . 548.9487663589061
So high and so conceited that there was no <UNK> him ! 1555.4596888987141
" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself . 1573.5862506126734
She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband . 982.7474021006714
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . 1665.9960086527342
What is it you are talking of ? 920.2534157450596
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . 1859.1603468898734
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 1548.4015163018116
who could have done less for her ? 1343.4847096026122
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . 2016.780086346371
" But so we all do . 480.7823981945639
But think no more of the letter . 536.5600157702784
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . 2055.0012721808503
" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . 1138.1838444172877
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . 1427.717290211392
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 1543.3367928004068
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . 806.3423705603819
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . 1921.5605204349326
" She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . " Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . 1764.1693226275295
F . 284.0918539513759
If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 1579.0819287065485
Lady Catherine ' s great attentions to Mrs . 380.26287946598313
To donate , please visit www . gutenberg . org donate Section . 1096.526096314089
<UNK> you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters . 2200.320078656318
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 698.8419600146825
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed ! 1550.9721667539877
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . 2000.4253694929146
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and <UNK> , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <UNK> her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . 2098.417826942817
and so extremely accomplished for her age ! 1233.991056143923
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 709.4092888853961
You alluded to something else . 634.4370638375518
" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the <UNK> <UNK> above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <UNK> than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . 2031.4439674398357
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . " This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . 1851.9213618958029
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted , is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK> their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and <UNK> them earnestly . But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . 2914.1481023745055
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . 2057.702572208495
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . " " What should not you mind ? " " I should not mind any thing at all . " " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . " " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail . 1141.236570523326
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it . 972.8485134988139
She is not such a simpleton . 589.4400834222844
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother ' s schemes . 1651.3715119044598
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . 1706.4540498899853
Without a governess you must have been neglected . " " <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . 2091.8725706612217
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the <UNK> of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . 2196.461102512897
She continued in very <UNK> reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 1757.0997504254206
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . 1741.1549032244268
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 1307.8491784278922
I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a <UNK> up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 1585.992520987604
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 1687.736337822757
One seems so <UNK> without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth . 1069.9227207104645
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . 2034.8673971754567
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 783.3059692316906
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 1901.0979205867864
Pray , how violent was Mr . Bingley ' s love ? " " I never saw a more promising inclination . 921.8408341369887
It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be <UNK> , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham . 2043.9846671375926
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 1022.81989805113
If gratitude and esteem are good <UNK> of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 2114.713466883838

But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my <UNK> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . 2300.0336176762976
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy . 1496.2856656088636
Their fortune on both sides is splendid . 1113.308817054158
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . 1269.1197693969852
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . 946.3662927814875
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . 1417.557978894606

how unlucky ! 481.28779708879625
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . 1068.4803143516338
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . 1628.2817154982365
CHAPTER III . 226.77357108648664
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 1311.3419437047241
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . 2149.3362170441965
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . " CHAPTER VI . 1441.3562236698738

" <UNK> resentment is a shade in a character . 1175.2463261062442
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 1628.7719658807357
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <UNK> him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 2226.7635524423536
I wish I could see her . 316.7943297619533
What a good joke it will be ! 693.9399766036987

For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . 2123.064903240847

To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 2177.5903186745286

If he had been <UNK> before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity <UNK> could make him . 2273.748629935545
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 2293.320807160409
" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . " While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . 1917.4445698907318
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of Darcy ' s . " " Oh ! 748.9948328322702

While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little <UNK> by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . 1929.0503235659846

Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , <UNK> that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ? 1779.2531414155076
We acted with the best intentions . " " Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " He brought it with him for us to see . " Jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to Elizabeth . 1735.1877873707128
But enough of this . 386.3363783802597
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . 1394.0507724723113
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . 2016.8610326818982

<UNK> spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother in law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . 2425.326823815635
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . 1939.3367824369454

It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . 967.832710429862
In the former were many good <UNK> ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some <UNK> of Miss Darcy ' s , in <UNK> , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . 2272.360634801034
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . 2206.902338654115
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . 1542.9764493703995
Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their <UNK> in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . 2160.6084756017417

If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . 2405.3480116235646
Sir William did not say much . 687.6437476776327

" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . 331.11772124795283
" Kitty and I are going <UNK> to sit in my dressing room . " Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room . 1831.2277800395818
Could he , or the Lucases , have <UNK> on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the <UNK> more effectually to what they related ? 2522.521565019259
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 1542.0774655822881
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . " They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . 1526.9911067921803
I am the happiest creature in the world . 339.77392122031625
Well , how pleased I am ! 845.087959625871
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . 1266.959560726782
Miss Darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . 1664.1273511753654
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " CHAPTER <UNK> . 2300.364061169693
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . 1071.3336414499875
If she does not object to it , why should we ? " " Her not objecting , does not justify him . 1251.5707840341336
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew . 674.6420814124231
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . 1977.2187566904452
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 865.4228512910001
I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister . 1443.6667105389045
And a special licence . 556.1567645144673
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . 1001.1405153045723
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ' s way . " Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <UNK> . 1838.6892667678405
Bennet give up the point . 551.9993672175135
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 1124.875989656497
Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . 2071.4498074623793
" Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? 395.758259535046
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 399.75571135130656
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . " " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? " " Indeed I had . 1660.691028307719

In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to <UNK> the engagements that had been made for him . 2075.238500185016
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 1876.1112100814823
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her . 1237.50098094818
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . " " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . 1772.2216483509567

Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . 1127.3835409003166
Her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 1933.871965765269

I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . 1583.8143102650215
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , <UNK> from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and <UNK> by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 2439.6431540909393

Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to <UNK> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . 2017.2662163990572
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . 1971.3941475763918

That such a consequence as this should <UNK> , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . " " When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . " " Not the slightest . 1754.9918440121805

It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and <UNK> of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their <UNK> . 2751.4107706473746

" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . 1262.9072335986245
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . " " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose . 894.5394115910975
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to <UNK> ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . 2368.751726701318
Her mind was less difficult to <UNK> . 1283.7928140712004
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . 2177.9304983333454
<UNK> ' s note <UNK> and <UNK> changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book . 2828.737681005919
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . 1079.7298240321911
She had got rid of two of the <UNK> which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . 2079.473821088905
You thought me then <UNK> of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . 1122.8163506224485
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 1581.5210834050913
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . 1982.5332388975362
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling . 2182.0020186295587
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 1297.2862590998864
" What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? " " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . " " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . 1261.2094806887967
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Mr . Darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <UNK> throughout the whole . 1943.199033290432
But will they make you happy ? " " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " <UNK> at all . 1096.4254633231342
But does not Jane <UNK> with the sister ? 1271.1292139627021
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 1649.0157248140802
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry <UNK> , a very mean art . " " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is <UNK> in all the arts which ladies sometimes <UNK> to employ for <UNK> . 2013.7058544480622
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself <UNK> watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . 1205.9980737730198
" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs . 627.2864501846602
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 941.2351100286239
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . 1942.4147945251361
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it . 2695.584412973618
" I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 1367.0484511708498
He had never had the slightest suspicion . 730.0572803833438
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 1462.1780925929813
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . 1393.6840907732021
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . 1457.0360784808115
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " " That you certainly shall . " " And I have another favour to ask . 1331.4411635541128
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . 1061.70404883508
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so <UNK> ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . 2295.891903877925
No , no I feel he may defy us there . 1137.1257204047945
Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a <UNK> chaise . " " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . 1167.585482727154
what could she mean by it ? 987.4375418622994
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . 1387.802516516566
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . 581.0088867040384
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s . 919.8605544581927
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 1097.4175771506011
By Mrs . 170.8883450828081
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . " " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . " " I beg your pardon . 791.0447293936852
She certainly did not hate him . 558.4845115335098
my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . " " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . 1595.4513671695615
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with . 1389.0646423657317
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman <UNK> the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . 1273.6977609654891
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 2166.0916648468046
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
" Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared . 998.7638022223318
Are the <UNK> of Pemberley to be thus <UNK> ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . 1693.7141164086684

The first week of their return was soon gone . 1018.8646625403079
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 1407.1576542426342
But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . 360.48054761164235

She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . 936.9247631855974
She then took a large house in <UNK> street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . 1809.0216231632005
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . 843.3769102337202
I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " " And they must marry ! 809.8589232292791
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . 738.6638147722822
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . 872.4983770720092
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly <UNK> , she seated herself . 2104.6213306631525
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 1508.2742832448878
The t te t te surprised them . 580.8530833050975
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can <UNK> a woman . " " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? 1618.681204692429
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . 1739.4472981720312
" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . 1654.8696479244309
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a <UNK> situation , and always spending more than they ought . 1819.2690638740073

She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . 2978.9707568408053

I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 1531.6569577577754
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . " " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . " " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . 1295.4884341728882

But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came . 1713.747373844515
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very <UNK> reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to <UNK> and <UNK> to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 2230.4409604083185
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley . 997.5813159612158
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 443.3451817638595
Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . 1093.6298364902625
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 1541.3498466049198
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? 1091.0255978663113
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage . 2362.687270077882
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over . 2227.83636424303
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so <UNK> courted you . 2328.6032976956008

She studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . 1600.710784586411
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners <UNK> respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 1927.5541433920234
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . " " Very true ; and if I had my will , we should . 1425.7215906993954
<UNK> felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . 1283.7990565297157
When this was done , she had a less active part to play . 1302.1138988424111
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had <UNK> <UNK> only four months ago , would now have been <UNK> and gratefully received ! 2245.785573969521
" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . 1203.0260089271503

Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? 1824.4783473014597
" I expected at least that the <UNK> were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! " " La ! 1560.6085618531026
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . 1361.8436251856215
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . 2228.802060684687
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <UNK> , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 2167.9926735627428
Your sweetness and <UNK> are really <UNK> ; I do not know what to say to you . 1173.2577605744582
It was not all settled before Monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . 1081.718554595794
She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <UNK> in so small a family as her ' s , and <UNK> her as to the care of her <UNK> and her poultry . 2095.610198016914
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 1792.4018977212231
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 1408.405368307638
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . " " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . " " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " I am not . " Lady Catherine seemed pleased . 1533.541166304653
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . 1354.8563546961125
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . 1263.1992622580526
That Mr .

Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . 1881.9029669293457
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 1132.1586457415342
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . 1860.6515744633239
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . 1487.8887326316062
Mr . Bennet ' s <UNK> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! 1825.5375694787826
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 2763.4715106996177

It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . 1696.8180905754646
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . 1090.597528887531
It is impossible for me to be impartial . 575.6121625670319

" Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say . 429.13341602028123
" But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not <UNK> his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . 1336.9977736619044
my sweetest Lizzy ! 537.2441729351565
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . 1818.0973669628113
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . 823.3097909103228
GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . 1271.300551173114

When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . 1860.2150699209105
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 1577.906668677931
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 588.337434883622
They followed her into the dining parlour . 713.9833739797871
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . 1603.1132649533295
Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . 1774.0137925178874
Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes . 2004.4948868141662
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 1593.7598846524022
sir , I do indeed . 848.1993871720983
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and <UNK> , though <UNK> families . 1946.2007560227112
If there were but such another man for you ! " " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . 1451.1118973135276
All was joy and kindness . 818.6520774568216
They are destined for each other by the voice of every <UNK> of their <UNK> houses ; and what is to divide them ? 2088.3053614347436
Lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . 1529.9546701773534
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 1374.4355323198242
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot . 529.2523608119662
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 1473.067821758448
Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . 693.1000808055909
Caroline is incapable of wilfully <UNK> any one ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . " " That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine . 1796.947555952435
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her . 704.8596984164491
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . 1863.064497433876
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 1122.2266367244667
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . " " You may depend upon it , Madam , " said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , " that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . " Mrs . 1000.1155168125518
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . 925.2386939660042
Perhaps he thought her too young . 1151.5302713283766
how I laughed ! 597.6559402668856
no it is not for me to be driven away by Mr . Darcy . 774.8243953259221
You will be a very happy woman . " Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 1576.8163388861328
Of course , we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg tm name associated with the work . 1709.135128350031
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley ' s behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . 1775.0368878682323
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what <UNK> his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 1968.3910100003895
" I cannot make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by <UNK> for being next in the entail ? We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " No , my dear ; I think not . 1846.0597106275277
I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 1282.7337643265057
But really , Ma ' am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . 1939.1309221914926
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no <UNK> the frequent mention of Wickham ' s name . 1263.9454810909922
He owns it himself without disguise . " " No " said Darcy , " I have made no such pretension . 880.3869752355455
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . 1220.9779934467258
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . " " But not before they went to Brighton ? " " No , I believe not . " " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? 1162.7189140377332
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> . 2074.4655980233847
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in <UNK> <UNK> to be her husband , might then have <UNK> in its proper place . 2043.9705307443135
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 1468.5309374669798
The <UNK> letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 2168.75522772995
Miss Bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . 816.0245580971779
Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt . 1339.149234380122
I hope he will overlook it . 404.13588587620217
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 873.4518921983376
how rich and how great you will be ! 1083.7922004646648
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> ! 1078.9003445805213
How was that possible ? 739.4747854585509
" Yes , Ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as <UNK> to the poor . " Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . 1483.2121406399074
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . 963.8990555560331
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> . 2205.4182951437633
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . 1206.514059063085
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <UNK> to her <UNK> , afforded no <UNK> of her distress . 2401.934881248919
how shall I bear so much happiness ! " She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty . 1792.9341309715273
I know we dine with four and twenty families . " Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could <UNK> Bingley to keep his countenance . 2039.0551224784795
To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough . 1033.9889909741037
I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to <UNK> such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room . 1639.127556871414
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 2050.458791974959
Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the <UNK> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . 2123.786033484612
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . " Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . 1363.8033996875447
Had it been your uncle ' s doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . 1911.5553223177653
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 990.7552520944937
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 1981.409907673893
CHAPTER II . 226.77357108648664
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 1334.7876229877158
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . 1291.2289193641009
His sense of her inferiority of its being a <UNK> of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . 2551.00119388663
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . 835.906013961521
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . 1746.3221013898906
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . 1813.9223143694908
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 2052.81812678471
" How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet ! 696.1747123573134
At night she opened her heart to Jane . 1035.7109855808005

" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 1436.2136453382325
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 1565.2673000909447
So near a <UNK> to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart . 2218.6930987333394
Heaven and <UNK> ! of what are you thinking ? 1903.5431476264525
" <UNK> <UNK> . " CHAPTER XIII . 871.6651419610495
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 2325.5209156683486
She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . 2038.0765905597227
She opened the door , and met Maria in the <UNK> place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza ! 1537.2372736426992
Long and the Gouldings soon . 785.6318289164725
They must have seen them together for ever . " " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . 1585.1078793789752
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . 1024.8074636525857
This information , however , startled Mrs . 479.62255764866785
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . 1298.7810579066636
I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 990.1315212147085
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 1044.5132881744146
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 574.0801248172531
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 1621.7558903443662
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . 1077.9328723028425
He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia . 1147.9756493537827
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . 1093.2636850755273
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips . 1529.3762056596129
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 1495.590778062153
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . 1461.7529037824745
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent <UNK> of <UNK> on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . 2334.1410123184114
No , never . 463.88202967349287
Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . 833.2822159271227

While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . 1535.1124204683247
" Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our <UNK> way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . " Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and <UNK> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 1769.3350983140353
Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . 521.0017158558044
They are my old friends . 531.9623153917893
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . 1698.8995728120296
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 2038.503954933991

The moral will be perfectly fair . 779.8139473012674
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " <UNK> you ! 1000.5119083127182
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . 2029.1556832414462
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? 1635.2496964739885
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . 1635.3923155010973
CHAPTER V . 251.15965623927994
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected . 908.5868237104168
" Oh ! 42.46667514260318
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon <UNK> up every private care ; and covering her face with her <UNK> , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . 2267.305325168806
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . 1381.789483932299
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 1895.686091963536
I could hardly keep my countenance . 599.0125668796303
She had no fear of its <UNK> farther , through his means . 1283.2750500560176
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings . 1526.7114401712988
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . 1494.9386016041933
So much the better . 426.42865600049066
Reynolds could interest her on no other point . 1294.529473053105
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . 1815.281000248289
have you heard from my uncle ? " " Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . " " Well , and what news does it bring ? 1114.1907401046255
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and <UNK> heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 1532.2960681501531
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . 724.4571807247553
" He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . 742.0394763133514
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 1247.0192763496866
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her <UNK> , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . " " She had better have <UNK> at home , " cried Elizabeth ; " perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours . 2104.527847352675
Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits <UNK> high . 1931.6526786193272
You need not . 256.16118716262713
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . 748.4189139173614
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . " " <UNK> ! " cried Bingley . 1145.8076542800193
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . 1234.0134465854744
" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs . 690.725770554236
But she would not be secure . 467.87161097457516
When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . 1647.6852965143105
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 1443.5212288958617
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 2137.7064918386145
How much sooner one <UNK> of any thing than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . " No one made any reply . 1982.6097295472207
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may <UNK> to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund . 2011.27297680351
Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 895.7012503880763
But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . 2062.1621766640756
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ; but his <UNK> about the whole Pemberley family are endless . 1962.3196471760543
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . " " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were <UNK> and insolent . 1468.3027043910895
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . " " Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly . 1169.1752549715156
By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <UNK> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 2139.610347357975

I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . 1460.7566758670475
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! 1338.6766035958942

Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . 1107.3669791124432
But what is that to me ? 638.4226522695009
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . 1194.5311462574423
Why must she be <UNK> about the country , because her sister had a cold ? 2055.3238951846483
