CHAPTER XII . 2154.4346900318833
Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . 1.615598098439874
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone . 1.778279410038923
Elizabeth felt Jane ' s pleasure . 26.82695795279726
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . 8.11130830789687
What <UNK> money , what <UNK> , what carriages you will have ! 5.878016072274914
Mr . Wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a <UNK> as she could . 1.9684194472866121
I am the happiest creature in the world . 12.915496650148839
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 1.2915496650148839
Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 3.593813663804627
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . 1.8329807108324359
Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . 2.7213387683753076
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . " From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . 1.7534865500829584
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 1.93069772888325
And what do you think she said besides ? 12.915496650148839
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 1.4773776525985112
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 2.1017480113324885
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . 17.78279410038923
Bennet was <UNK> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and <UNK> in her <UNK> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the <UNK> happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 1.3708385261355818
Royalty payments must be paid within days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your <UNK> tax returns . 2.51188643150958
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this <UNK> . 2.2122162910704493
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 8.11130830789687
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . " He is now gone into the army , " she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . " Mrs . 1.41011239906908
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . " " Lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . " " I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a <UNK> of character . 1.3433993325989002
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of Darcy ' s . " " Oh ! 2.8480358684358014
His words seemed to <UNK> it . 26.82695795279726
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 3.359818286283782
And it is the more to be <UNK> , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte <UNK> me , that this <UNK> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs . 1.5085907086001784
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 1.425102670302998
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my <UNK> . " " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . 2.154434690031884
All field <UNK> were over . 46.415888336127786
" Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane ' s . " CHAPTER XVIII . 2.2122162910704493
" Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . " " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . " " Oh ! 1.8047217668271702
<UNK> sons cannot marry where they like . " " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . " " Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . " " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl ' s younger son ? 1.2376350284724815
" So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find . 2.9935772947204895
So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 3.1622776601683795
It was a fortnight since Mrs . 26.82695795279726
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago . " " I have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " My eldest sister has been in town these three months . 2.154434690031884
Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment . 12.915496650148839
. F . . Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph . F . , this work is provided to you ' <UNK> <UNK> ' , <UNK> NO <UNK> WARRANTIES OF ANY <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF <UNK> OR <UNK> FOR ANY <UNK> . 1.4873521072935114
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . But good lord ! 3.1622776601683795
The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 4.216965034285822
She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <UNK> him with fears and regrets in <UNK> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 1.2990813969063477
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " Well , Jane , who is it from ? 2.154434690031884
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . " " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . 1.4873521072935114
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged . 2.154434690031884
CHAPTER XIX . 2154.4346900318833
CHAPTER XII . 2154.4346900318833
I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to <UNK> such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room . 1.4977474763452014
it must be my uncle ' s doings ! 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . 1.3433993325989002
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . 3.8746751204561316
" Oh ! 2154.4346900318833
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 1.2451970847350329
Brighton , and a whole <UNK> of <UNK> , to us , who have been <UNK> already by one poor regiment of militia , and the <UNK> balls of Meryton . " " Now I have got some news for you , " said Lydia , as they sat down to table . 1.5441135899948315
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 1.2451970847350329
She went on . 316.22776601683796
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . 6.812920690579612
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ? 3.593813663804627
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . 1.6681005372000588
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? " " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . 1.3708385261355818
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been <UNK> by long expectations . 3.359818286283782
" Oh , Jane , take care . " " My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . " " I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . " They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs . 1.4330125702369627
" And is this all ? " cried Elizabeth . 10.000000000000002
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 1.41011239906908
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . 2.8480358684358014
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . 2.0535250264571463
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . 8.11130830789687
Collins well . " " Yes , very well . 10.000000000000002
But on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . 1.8632463119315603

My courage always <UNK> with every attempt to <UNK> me . " " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . " Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . 1.2260144114527525
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . 3.8746751204561316
" You may well warn me against such an evil . 8.11130830789687
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . 2.346228848142263
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 2.346228848142263
I had not believed it possible . " " I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth . 3.593813663804627
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . " <UNK> as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat <UNK> , she had all the success she expected . 1.3287913432286882
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . 1.4773776525985112
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . 1.7301957388458942
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . 5.878016072274914
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took <UNK> in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 2.154434690031884
Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . 10.000000000000002
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . 3.593813663804627
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . 8.11130830789687
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 5.179474679231212
" And this is always the way with him , " she added . " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . 2.0535250264571463
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 10.000000000000002
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . 2.51188643150958
He was angry . 316.22776601683796
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 1.4873521072935114
" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire . 2.2758459260747883
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . 4.641588833612778
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . 6.812920690579612
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s <UNK> . 2.7213387683753076
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . " " What should not you mind ? " " I should not mind any thing at all . " " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . " " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail . 1.4030037231905736
Mr . Bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . 1.4497406703726319
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . 1.4497406703726319
Shall you like to have such a brother ? " " Very , very much . 4.216965034285822
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . 1.213482767749144
" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . 10.000000000000002
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam . 4.641588833612778
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 1.7082763938087104
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 4.641588833612778
When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . 2.2758459260747883
<UNK> would like to go too of all things ! 10.000000000000002
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 1.9684194472866121
And for this we are to be thankful . 12.915496650148839
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 2.0535250264571463
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . 2.7213387683753076
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 2.9935772947204895
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . 2.9935772947204895
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its <UNK> , to think of any thing else . 1.5085907086001784
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . " " Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . 1.5085907086001784
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . 2.9935772947204895
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 4.216965034285822
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . " " Oh ! 2.346228848142263
You refuse to <UNK> the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . 5.179474679231212
I shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will <UNK> and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " Elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 1.1859710123376697
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . 3.359818286283782
Perhaps I am not doing her justice . 17.78279410038923
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <UNK> satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 1.8632463119315603
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 2.8480358684358014
It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . " " Oh ! 1.93069772888325
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his <UNK> powers had gained him in the <UNK> . 1.6496480740980204
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . " CHAPTER VI . 1.632172128563275
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . 3.1622776601683795
Bennet said only , " <UNK> , nonsense ! " " What can be the meaning of that <UNK> exclamation ? " cried he . 2.51188643150958
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 2.4244620170823286
He was received by Mrs . 46.415888336127786
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months . 1.4497406703726319
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be <UNK> to you to let them go alone . " " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " " Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . 1.4174741629268053
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were <UNK> of dejection . 1.778279410038923
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 1.778279410038923
They walked on , without knowing in what direction . 10.000000000000002
His sense of her inferiority of its being a <UNK> of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . 1.632172128563275
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 5.878016072274914
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? 4.641588833612778
Then pray speak aloud . 100.00000000000004
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 17.78279410038923
Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . 4.216965034285822
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing . 2.154434690031884
" Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? 2.610157215682537
What do you keep winking at me for ? 12.915496650148839
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . 3.1622776601683795
Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by <UNK> to his sister . 1.9684194472866121
CHAPTER III . 2154.4346900318833
At night she opened her heart to Jane . 12.915496650148839
Poor little Lizzy ! 316.22776601683796
Mr . Bennet protested against any description of finery . 10.000000000000002
Elizabeth <UNK> the next morning to the same thoughts and <UNK> which had at length closed her eyes . 3.359818286283782
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . 5.878016072274914
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and <UNK> every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the <UNK> of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 1.5441135899948315
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . 1.396135390856794
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . " " I should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother . 1.632172128563275
CHAPTER XV . 2154.4346900318833
" Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . " She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . 1.4330125702369627
why is not every body as happy ? " Elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . 2.0535250264571463
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent . 6.812920690579612
Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits <UNK> high . 2.154434690031884
Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 1.9684194472866121
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs . 2.610157215682537
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw . 2.154434690031884
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . 1.8957356524063758
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking . 2.346228848142263
No , never . 316.22776601683796
He replied , and was again silent . 17.78279410038923
Bennet ' s <UNK> was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter . 3.359818286283782
Gardiner , though unknown . 100.00000000000004
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish . 1.19708503049573
I appeal to Mr . Darcy but let me not interrupt you , Sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the <UNK> converse of that young lady , whose <UNK> eyes are also <UNK> me . " The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 1.2990813969063477
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth ! 4.216965034285822
" A man who has once been refused ! 12.915496650148839
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the <UNK> girls in the country . 1.7301957388458942
Bennet was <UNK> the fire . 46.415888336127786
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . 2.51188643150958
" I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . 1.8329807108324359
" And may I ask ? " said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . " " <UNK> with ! 2.2758459260747883
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the <UNK> of red <UNK> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 1.8632463119315603
After a short silence , the lady first spoke . 10.000000000000002
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . " She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . 1.8329807108324359
And it was settled that we should all be there by <UNK> o ' clock . 4.216965034285822
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 2.9935772947204895
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 4.216965034285822
And pray what sort of <UNK> do you make ? 10.000000000000002
He heard her with astonishment . 46.415888336127786
Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical . 12.915496650148839
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can ' t think . 4.216965034285822
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . 3.8746751204561316
A <UNK> life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . 3.359818286283782
I came to try you . 46.415888336127786
" How <UNK> have I acted ! " she cried . " I , who have <UNK> myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! 2.0535250264571463
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge . 1.9684194472866121
Have not you always hated him ? " How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! 2.2758459260747883
I have not been in the habit of <UNK> disappointment . " " That will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . " " I will not be interrupted . 1.7082763938087104
<UNK> ' s note <UNK> and <UNK> changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book . 3.1622776601683795
He is come Mr . Bingley is come . He is , indeed . 5.179474679231212
how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would <UNK> you about to all the balls . 2.610157215682537
<UNK> there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or <UNK> . 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 1.7082763938087104
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . 6.812920690579612
" Good Heaven ! 316.22776601683796
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such <UNK> sisters , home could not be <UNK> , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake . 1.8957356524063758
That is all settled . " " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . 2.4244620170823286
I am ashamed of you ! 46.415888336127786

Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time . 2.610157215682537
The loo table , however , did not appear . 10.000000000000002
She blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . 2.346228848142263
You never see a fault in any body . 12.915496650148839

But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey . 3.8746751204561316
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . 12.915496650148839
Collins , you must send a servant with them . 10.000000000000002
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . 2.2122162910704493
<UNK> has she condescended to give me her opinion <UNK> too ! on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our <UNK> at quadrille , while Mrs . 1.8632463119315603

He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . 2.1017480113324885
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . 2.2122162910704493
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 10.000000000000002
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 5.179474679231212
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 1.632172128563275
It is impossible that he should still love me .

" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . 2.610157215682537
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 1.3708385261355818
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . " " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . " Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . 1.425102670302998
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 2.2758459260747883
On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and told her with great <UNK> that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . 1.4677992676220695
Have you had any flirting ? 46.415888336127786
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new <UNK> . 2.4244620170823286
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . 1.7301957388458942

Five daughters <UNK> entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . 3.593813663804627
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . 2.9935772947204895
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . 1.5848931924611136
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 3.359818286283782
Now what have you to say ? " " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . " Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . 1.5085907086001784

For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . 3.359818286283782
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! 10.000000000000002
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 1.353876180022544
But at length , by Elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that <UNK> which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the <UNK> . 1.2478254704700218
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 1.5706464294715548
" It certainly is a most <UNK> affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . 2.154434690031884
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 2.7213387683753076
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been <UNK> from the world , in some distant farm house . 1.7301957388458942
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . " Mrs . 3.593813663804627
Mr . Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . 1.425102670302998

How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 1.425102670302998

No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . 3.593813663804627
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . 1.557068404753731

These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 2.2758459260747883

When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses .

The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 1.6496480740980204
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 1.6496480740980204

It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and <UNK> , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <UNK> her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . 1.365007806546014

On being made acquainted with the present Mr .

As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! How much of good or evil must be done by him ! 1.5998587196060583

Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 3.593813663804627
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . 4.216965034285822
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . 3.359818286283782
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London . 4.641588833612778
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . 4.216965034285822
We had better not mention it . 26.82695795279726
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , glancing at her sister and Bingley , shall take place . 1.5706464294715548
" From what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs . 5.878016072274914

Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . 1.3593563908785256
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . 2.154434690031884

People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . 3.8746751204561316
Philips first brought her the news . " Well , so much the better . 4.641588833612778
" <UNK> in other words , you are determined to have him . 5.878016072274914
A clergyman like you must marry . <UNK> properly , chuse a <UNK> for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . 1.5848931924611136
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . 4.641588833612778
They entered it in one of its <UNK> points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , <UNK> over a wide extent . 2.4244620170823286
Bennet thus began the <UNK> conversation . " Oh ! 10.000000000000002
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled . 2.4244620170823286
You mentioned two instances . 100.00000000000004
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . 2.9935772947204895
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very <UNK> manner , with all the <UNK> which he supposed a regular part of the business . 1.4412195967188537
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 2.154434690031884
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more . 6.812920690579612
My poor father ! 316.22776601683796
Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active <UNK> , and when immediately before my father ' s death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . " " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth . 1.353876180022544
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . 6.812920690579612
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 4.641588833612778
Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at <UNK> , and Mrs . 5.179474679231212
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . " " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . " " In <UNK> your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were <UNK> . 1.2679227183627855
" Oh ! 2154.4346900318833
No , no , you shall not deceive me . 10.000000000000002
I am sure you must feel it so . " " Oh ! 5.878016072274914
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please . 2.51188643150958
" Oh ! 2154.4346900318833
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , <UNK> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . 1.53174046370208
" Not at all . 100.00000000000004
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . 2.8480358684358014
That he has neither integrity nor honour . 17.78279410038923
The <UNK> of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . 2.346228848142263
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips . 5.179474679231212
I do not deserve it . 46.415888336127786
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over . 2.4244620170823286
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him . 3.8746751204561316
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern <UNK> , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . 1.221677348996792
It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . 2.0092330025650473
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 1.1733955704930705
But of course she did not mention my name to you . " " Yes , she did . " " And what did she say ? " " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well . 1.632172128563275
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr . Darcy . " She then sought her eldest sister , who had <UNK> to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . 1.8047217668271702
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . 4.641588833612778
If he had been <UNK> before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity <UNK> could make him . 1.5706464294715548
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough . 46.415888336127786
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . " " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 1.8329807108324359
I know we dine with four and twenty families . " Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could <UNK> Bingley to keep his countenance . 2.610157215682537
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish . 5.179474679231212
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild <UNK> , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character . 2.1017480113324885
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . 1.9684194472866121
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 4.216965034285822
And she was only sixteen last June . 17.78279410038923
The other is Miss De Bourgh . 26.82695795279726

Not to appear to disgrace his family , to <UNK> from the <UNK> qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . 2.2122162910704493
Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? 2.2122162910704493
" His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . 6.812920690579612

How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . 2.346228848142263
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 2.610157215682537
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . 1.4330125702369627
" You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice . 1.7534865500829584
Could there be finer symptoms ? 46.415888336127786
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . 1.5199110829529336
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth was delighted . 316.22776601683796
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . " " I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your <UNK> what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . 1.7301957388458942
I am afraid you will be angry . " " My dearest sister , now be be serious . 3.359818286283782
Bennet was most <UNK> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 1.5199110829529336
<UNK> , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . 2.8480358684358014
" Lizzy , you must not do so . 12.915496650148839
Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . 2.8480358684358014

Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s <UNK> , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any <UNK> of sentiment . If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error . 1.365007806546014
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . 4.216965034285822
Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! Yes certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . " And <UNK> her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma ' am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr . Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . 1.2775649214671148
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 3.593813663804627
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent . 1.778279410038923
I am sick of them all . 26.82695795279726
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this <UNK> recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy ! 1.4585940117250362
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " I have just received your letter , and shall <UNK> this whole morning to answering it , as I <UNK> that a little writing will not <UNK> what I have to tell you . 1.778279410038923

so much the man of fashion ! 26.82695795279726
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 6.812920690579612
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 1.3070104796093682

The <UNK> <UNK> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have . 1.4977474763452014
<UNK> and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was <UNK> and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . 2.0535250264571463
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <UNK> ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had <UNK> , in his offer to herself . 1.615598098439874
" Mrs . 2154.4346900318833
" For my own part , " she <UNK> , " I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . 2.610157215682537
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <UNK> , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 1.778279410038923
I am not qualified to form one . 17.78279410038923
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . 3.1622776601683795
I write without any intention of <UNK> you , or <UNK> myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the <UNK> , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . 1.425102670302998
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . " They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . 1.324192791886045
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 2.51188643150958
She studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . 4.216965034285822
" Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared . 5.179474679231212
The <UNK> would be spoilt by <UNK> a fourth . 10.000000000000002
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 2.51188643150958
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . 2.346228848142263
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time . 2.4244620170823286
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty <UNK> , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . 1.8957356524063758
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper <UNK> . 4.216965034285822

You see on what a footing we are . 12.915496650148839
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 2.2122162910704493
From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . 10.000000000000002
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . 46.415888336127786
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not <UNK> , but haughty . 2.8480358684358014
After a short pause , her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me . 3.359818286283782
" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides <UNK> tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! " Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . 1.3433993325989002
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . 3.593813663804627
no , no , this is not likely . 12.915496650148839
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . 6.812920690579612
We do not suffer by accident . 26.82695795279726
no . I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . " " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may <UNK> our different opinions . " " No I cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . " " The present always <UNK> you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt . 1.2710617996147449
Pemberley was now Georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . 2.7213387683753076
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . " Mr . Bingley followed his advice . 2.2122162910704493
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! 3.1622776601683795
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Had it been your uncle ' s doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . 2.2122162910704493
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . 10.000000000000002
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an <UNK> of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . 2.1017480113324885
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <UNK> for Mr . Darcy ' s pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham . 1.1176586373945465
Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . 1.3708385261355818
Gardiner was so little to be trusted . " " You must not blame my aunt . 3.8746751204561316
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 5.179474679231212
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . " " I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a kingdom ! 1.5848931924611136
Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c . 2.4244620170823286
She was overpowered by shame and vexation . 17.78279410038923
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . 12.915496650148839
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . 2.2122162910704493
Her mother ' s <UNK> , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . 1.5199110829529336
I believe I have now told you every thing . 10.000000000000002
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 12.915496650148839
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr . Darcy . 1.5848931924611136
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 1.295267744355328
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from <UNK> in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death <UNK> of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and <UNK> as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly <UNK> her father not to let her go . 1.396135390856794
never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F . 3.1622776601683795
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . 3.593813663804627
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? 12.915496650148839
" I never heard any thing so abominable . 12.915496650148839
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 1.295267744355328
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing room . 2.610157215682537
<UNK> me whilst you can . " " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . " " Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . " " I cannot believe it . 1.8632463119315603
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . 1.4873521072935114
And who knows what may happen ? 26.82695795279726
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . 3.359818286283782
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had . 1.6876124757881477
Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar . 1.778279410038923
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals . 2.2758459260747883
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your <UNK> . " " I should imagine not . " " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . 1.365007806546014
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother ' s schemes . 1.632172128563275
Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . 4.216965034285822
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before . 2.154434690031884
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 1.5085907086001784
I am glad he <UNK> here on Tuesday . 12.915496650148839
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . 3.8746751204561316
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 8.11130830789687
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . 1.5706464294715548
He owns it himself without disguise . " " No " said Darcy , " I have made no such pretension . 2.8480358684358014
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . 1.6681005372000588
It was a large , well <UNK> room , handsomely fitted up . 5.878016072274914
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 3.8746751204561316
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley ' s <UNK> on fine eyes . 1.41011239906908
" He seems to be a most <UNK> and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so <UNK> as to let him come to us again . " " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . " " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . " Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of <UNK> , marrying , and <UNK> his <UNK> whenever it were required . 1.1671161911100678
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . 4.216965034285822
" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But now we may be silent . " " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " Sometimes . 1.53174046370208
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short <UNK> . " " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . 1.5085907086001784
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? 4.216965034285822
<UNK> them next to your great uncle the judge . 10.000000000000002
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 1.7534865500829584
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of inviting him . " " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . 1.6496480740980204
This information , however , startled Mrs . 17.78279410038923
I am not to be <UNK> into anything so wholly unreasonable . 6.812920690579612
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . 3.359818286283782
I would keep a pack of <UNK> , and drink a bottle of wine every day . " " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . 1.93069772888325
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 1.5085907086001784
At present I will say nothing about it . " " You are quite right . 4.216965034285822
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . 2.346228848142263
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . 5.179474679231212
<UNK> , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . 8.11130830789687
As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it <UNK> and lovely as ever . 1.53174046370208
Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ? 2.610157215682537
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 1.4977474763452014
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 1.295267744355328
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs . 4.641588833612778
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever . 6.812920690579612
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well . 3.593813663804627
" He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived . 2.9935772947204895
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . 4.641588833612778
" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . 4.641588833612778
You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <UNK> is denied me , because you have always so much . " Mr . Bingley arrived . 2.0535250264571463
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 1.7534865500829584
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . 1.4773776525985112
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation . 2.8480358684358014
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 3.593813663804627
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . 2.2758459260747883
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard <UNK> in any of the family . 2.0092330025650473
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . 2.346228848142263
" What will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are ! 3.359818286283782
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " Their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . 1.295267744355328
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . 2.4244620170823286
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to <UNK> him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <UNK> of your understanding , but <UNK> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <UNK> , and those which <UNK> the <UNK> ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the <UNK> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 1.110336318167638
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . 5.179474679231212
The <UNK> pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . 4.641588833612778
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . 2.7213387683753076
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 3.593813663804627
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 2.51188643150958
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 2.2758459260747883
" Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say . 2.7213387683753076
Bennet , who assured him with some <UNK> that they were very well able to keep a good <UNK> , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <UNK> . 2.0535250264571463
" I am trying to make it out . " " And what is your success ? " She shook her head . 2.7213387683753076
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 1.6496480740980204
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . 2.0092330025650473
At length however Mrs . 100.00000000000004
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 2.0092330025650473
I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . " " I desire you will do no such thing . 1.425102670302998
Bennet ' s <UNK> looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . 3.593813663804627
" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . 1.5848931924611136
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ' s regiment . " His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative . 1.5848931924611136
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <UNK> recommendation , and to assert that I had <UNK> all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . 1.557068404753731
Pray forgive me , if I have been very <UNK> , or at least do not punish me so far , as to <UNK> me from <UNK> . 2.2758459260747883
Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . 6.812920690579612
" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . 1.6876124757881477
" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? " " To morrow fortnight . " " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill <UNK> of Lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . 1.7082763938087104
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
" What can be the meaning of this ! " said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone . 3.1622776601683795
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . 1.7082763938087104
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . 1.8632463119315603
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <UNK> by Wickham . 2.0092330025650473
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece . 2.7213387683753076
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . 2.8480358684358014
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . 1.4497406703726319
A clear ten thousand per annum . 26.82695795279726
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . 1.615598098439874
By nature <UNK> , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James ' s had made him <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . 12.915496650148839
" He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . 1.4030037231905736
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 4.216965034285822
Let us hope for better things . 26.82695795279726
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . 1.9684194472866121
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well . 5.179474679231212
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . 1.93069772888325
Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 2.2122162910704493
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
Why should they try to influence him ? 17.78279410038923
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 2.1017480113324885
I know how much you dislike him . " " You know nothing of the matter . 3.8746751204561316
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 2154.4346900318833
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 1.4977474763452014
what hours of <UNK> we shall spend ! 17.78279410038923
But are you pleased , Jane ? 26.82695795279726
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . 6.812920690579612
The Foundation ' s <UNK> or federal tax <UNK> number is . 6.812920690579612
Mr . and Mrs . 100.00000000000004
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " Ah ! 1.8957356524063758
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 1.7301957388458942
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . " " What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? 1.8632463119315603
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 2.346228848142263
You are safe from me . " " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . " " And your defect is a <UNK> to hate every body . " " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . " " Do let us have a little music , " cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . " Louisa , you will not mind my <UNK> Mr . Hurst . " Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . 1.180164226522293
I am most seriously displeased . " Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . 2.1017480113324885
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! 1.2260144114527525
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile it was decided . 2.51188643150958
" She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . " Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . 1.302994338575022
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . 1.5199110829529336
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford <UNK> , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 1.4873521072935114
" I am sure there is not on his . 10.000000000000002
I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . " Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . 1.5441135899948315
Wickham ! 100000.00000000001
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F . 8.11130830789687
His temptation is not <UNK> to the risk . " " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment . 2.346228848142263
Mr . Collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . 5.179474679231212
Mr . Darcy replied with great <UNK> , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley . 2.610157215682537
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should <UNK> an occasion of <UNK> his respect towards any body connected with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared . Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . 1.2154742500762865
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . 1.41011239906908
" You forget that I have made no answer . 10.000000000000002
They had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister . 5.179474679231212
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 1.5706464294715548
Perhaps he thought her too young . 26.82695795279726
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 2.4244620170823286
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . 4.641588833612778
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . 2.154434690031884
Mr . Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . 5.179474679231212
Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very <UNK> too for it is provoking me to <UNK> , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly . 1.3768571648527583
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 3.1622776601683795
She now lost every expectation of pleasure . 17.78279410038923
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . " " Oh ! 1.8632463119315603
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day <UNK> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . 1.615598098439874
But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 1.7301957388458942
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . 1.4773776525985112
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her <UNK> , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . " " She had better have <UNK> at home , " cried Elizabeth ; " perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours . 1.2915496650148839
But I dare not hope it . 26.82695795279726
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . 8.11130830789687
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 1.6876124757881477
Gardiner , rendered <UNK> by Elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . 3.593813663804627
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . 1.8047217668271702
A thousand things may arise in six months ! " The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . 2.610157215682537
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . 5.179474679231212
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . 4.216965034285822
At five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . 2.7213387683753076
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . " " To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . " " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . " " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . 1.2260144114527525
My feelings will not be repressed . 26.82695795279726
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 1.228247006346923
Mr . Bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is <UNK> with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . " She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . 1.3433993325989002
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . 2.4244620170823286
To his <UNK> engagement with Miss De Bourgh ? 12.915496650148839
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were <UNK> the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . 1.7082763938087104
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 2.2122162910704493
No , no , let me <UNK> for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret . 1.615598098439874
You must therefore allow me to follow the <UNK> of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . 2.1017480113324885
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 1.6876124757881477
my dear , " continued Mrs . 26.82695795279726
I quite detest the man . " CHAPTER IV . 10.000000000000002
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 1.8632463119315603
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! 10.000000000000002
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 1.778279410038923
Mr . Darcy is engaged to my daughter . 12.915496650148839
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 1.425102670302998
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so . 2.51188643150958
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 2.2758459260747883
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . " " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <UNK> which other people may observe . 1.324192791886045
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 17.78279410038923
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . 1.2115276586285884
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 1.333521432163324
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 2.346228848142263
They had frequently been staying with her in town . 10.000000000000002
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 3.359818286283782
I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! 2.2122162910704493
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . 12.915496650148839
You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! 5.878016072274914
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . 1.4873521072935114
Charles , when you <UNK> your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 1.5706464294715548
END OF VOL . 316.22776601683796
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 2.2758459260747883
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . " She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . " Again his astonishment was <UNK> ; and he looked at her with an expression of <UNK> incredulity and mortification . 1.1568875283162823
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . 3.359818286283782
Collins was settled near her family . " " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . 3.1622776601683795
She then took a large house in <UNK> street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . 3.359818286283782
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself <UNK> watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . 2.0535250264571463
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . 2.2122162910704493
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . 3.593813663804627
yes . 100000.00000000001
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . 8.11130830789687
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " " You may as well call it impertinence at once . 1.8957356524063758
But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam . 3.593813663804627
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 2.8480358684358014
The second began . 316.22776601683796
Your mother <UNK> upon your accepting it . 17.78279410038923
In Three Volumes . 316.22776601683796
They are my old friends . 46.415888336127786
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 17.78279410038923
Lydia was Lydia still ; <UNK> , <UNK> , wild , noisy , and <UNK> . 4.216965034285822
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . 1.8047217668271702
Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley ' s continued absence . 3.1622776601683795
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 3.1622776601683795
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 1.8632463119315603
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon <UNK> deliberation , you find that the misery of <UNK> his two sisters is more than <UNK> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . " " How can you talk so ? " said Jane <UNK> smiling , " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . " " I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . " " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 1.1397725198066269
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 8.11130830789687
Does your charge give you much trouble ? 17.78279410038923
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . 5.179474679231212
At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . " With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 1.557068404753731
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and <UNK> forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . 2.610157215682537
<UNK> the works from public domain <UNK> editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works , so the Foundation and you ! can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties . 1.6876124757881477
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? 1.6496480740980204
<UNK> spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother in law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . 1.5848931924611136
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 1.5848931924611136
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 2.2758459260747883
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 2.4244620170823286
Younge was of course removed from her charge . 12.915496650148839
CHAPTER VI . 2154.4346900318833
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . 1.4412195967188537
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? 8.11130830789687
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . " She was then proceeding to all the particulars of <UNK> , muslin , and <UNK> , and would shortly have <UNK> some very <UNK> orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted . 1.3894954943731377
is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must <UNK> us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . " Then shewing her purchases " <UNK> here , I have bought this bonnet . 1.4977474763452014
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . 6.812920690579612
It was to be such a secret ! " " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject . 2.154434690031884
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified . 4.641588833612778
" <UNK> it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . " " Gracechurch street , Monday , <UNK> . 2.154434690031884
and so did Mrs . 100.00000000000004
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! 6.812920690579612
We now come to the point . 26.82695795279726
" You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 2.4244620170823286
But it was a hope shortly checked by other <UNK> , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . 1.5085907086001784
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . " " She is a very fine looking woman ! 2.346228848142263
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . 3.593813663804627
This cannot be ! 316.22776601683796
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . 1.338388753173757
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . 3.1622776601683795
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . 4.641588833612778
When you told Mrs . 100.00000000000004
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , <UNK> against the <UNK> conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . 1.3894954943731377
Mr . Darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . 6.812920690579612
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . 1.9684194472866121
" You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . 3.359818286283782
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . 2.1017480113324885
c . " Mr . Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . 2.0092330025650473
You must and shall be married by a special licence . 8.11130830789687
" He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . 1.8047217668271702
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild <UNK> of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . 1.7301957388458942
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry . 2.1017480113324885
" Yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally <UNK> , without raising all this <UNK> ! 1.9684194472866121
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 2.0092330025650473
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid . 1.8632463119315603
Who are your uncles and <UNK> ? 26.82695795279726
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . 5.179474679231212
In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 1.9684194472866121
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . 10.000000000000002
Mr . Darcy may <UNK> himself . " " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried Elizabeth . 2.7213387683753076
They are gone off together from Brighton . 17.78279410038923
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . 2.8480358684358014
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . 8.11130830789687
By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <UNK> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 1.8632463119315603
He was the <UNK> , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . 2.610157215682537
<UNK> the Foundation as set forth in Section below . 10.000000000000002
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? 8.11130830789687
Mr . Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . 5.179474679231212
When Mrs . 2154.4346900318833
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . 2.154434690031884
Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . 1.6876124757881477

If gratitude and esteem are good <UNK> of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 2.7213387683753076
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 5.878016072274914
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . 1.5441135899948315
His <UNK> to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 2.610157215682537
But enough of this . 100.00000000000004

More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr . Darcy . She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! Yet it did , and even a third . 1.319720393061375
I will leave him to himself . " In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . 1.7082763938087104
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . 5.179474679231212
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 1.2505106035854068

My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . 1.557068404753731
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . 1.396135390856794
He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these <UNK> had arisen his principal <UNK> . 3.1622776601683795
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . 4.641588833612778
Pray do not talk of that odious man . 12.915496650148839
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . 1.7534865500829584
Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently . 17.78279410038923
" Oh ! 2154.4346900318833
" You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age . " " I am not one and twenty . " When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . 1.615598098439874
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of <UNK> should not be broken in on . 2.610157215682537

Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 1.2618568830660204
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . 1.8329807108324359
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him . 1.5848931924611136
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . 1.93069772888325
Oh , no . " " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . " " No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . " " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . " She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . 1.3485595530525598

My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . 2.610157215682537
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . " Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of <UNK> such reflections . 1.557068404753731
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 1.338388753173757
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy ' s meditated elopement . 4.641588833612778
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . 1.3593563908785256
We passed each other several times . 26.82695795279726
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . 3.359818286283782
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them . " This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret . 1.3593563908785256
what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . 1.6876124757881477
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . 2.610157215682537
We have heard nothing from town . " " Dear madam , " cried Mrs . 4.216965034285822
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . 1.778279410038923

It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . " " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an <UNK> , <UNK> disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will <UNK> the whole room , and be handed down to <UNK> with all the <UNK> of a <UNK> . " " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he . 1.1635618505359069
You are lucky in having such a master . " " Yes , Sir , I know I am . 3.1622776601683795
But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . 1.7534865500829584
Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . " " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . " " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " I honour your circumspection . 1.302994338575022
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? " " Most willingly . " " You shall have it in few words . 1.7082763938087104
Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . 1.3708385261355818
" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be <UNK> , for <UNK> I must call it . " " It is wonderful , " replied Wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 1.338388753173757
<UNK> requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much <UNK> and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements . 2.4244620170823286
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 2.0535250264571463
" Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . 3.1622776601683795
Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . " Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . 1.9684194472866121
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . 3.593813663804627
you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 1.213482767749144
She answered him with cold civility . 26.82695795279726
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 2.346228848142263

And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? 2.2122162910704493
The time fixed for the beginning of their <UNK> tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . 1.2843862635897427
They followed her into the dining parlour . 17.78279410038923
Such very superior dancing is not often seen . 12.915496650148839
Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . 2.346228848142263
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be <UNK> to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a <UNK> nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . 1.4174741629268053
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of <UNK> them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <UNK> , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the <UNK> kind . " She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <UNK> by any feeling of <UNK> . 1.2990813969063477
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ' s <UNK> , and complimented her on bearing it so well . 3.1622776601683795
<UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . 1.4977474763452014
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 5.878016072274914
But papa is so disagreeable . " " A little <UNK> bathing would set me up for ever . " " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty . 1.7534865500829584
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard . 4.216965034285822
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . 10.000000000000002
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and <UNK> way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to morrow evening . 1.6496480740980204
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . 2.4244620170823286
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . 1.3894954943731377
" <UNK> Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at <UNK> , if the drawing room were larger ; but <UNK> is too far off ! 1.8047217668271702

On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 1.5848931924611136

While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . 1.615598098439874
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . 8.11130830789687
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ? 2.9935772947204895
Is not it so , Mrs . 26.82695795279726
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . 17.78279410038923
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 2.346228848142263
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I cannot blame myself for having done thus much . 2.0092330025650473
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , <UNK> , manner of talking to her brother . 1.8632463119315603
I do not wish to avoid the walk . 12.915496650148839
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . Oh ! 5.179474679231212
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . 2.1017480113324885
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . 5.878016072274914
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . 1.4873521072935114
Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . 2.7213387683753076
She would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house . " Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer . 1.778279410038923
" I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . 2.7213387683753076
On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . 2.8480358684358014
What am I to do ? " " Nothing child , nothing . 5.878016072274914
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . 1.6681005372000588
Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . 5.179474679231212
Its banks were neither formal , nor <UNK> adorned . 10.000000000000002
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 4.216965034285822
I thought I should have died . 26.82695795279726
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . 1.6876124757881477
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 2.4244620170823286
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . 3.8746751204561316
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the <UNK> property of some one or other of their daughters . 1.5706464294715548
CHAPTER VII . 2154.4346900318833
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 3.1622776601683795
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so <UNK> that I cannot answer for being <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten . 3.1622776601683795
Make haste , make haste . 46.415888336127786
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 1.8047217668271702
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 2.2758459260747883
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . 1.615598098439874
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . " " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . " " I beg your pardon . 2.0535250264571463
What are men to <UNK> and mountains ? 17.78279410038923
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 10.000000000000002
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh ! 10.000000000000002
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . 2.8480358684358014
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 10.000000000000002
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 2.610157215682537
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <UNK> in the gaieties which that season generally <UNK> , and that your <UNK> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall <UNK> you . " " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . " " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . " " Why will you think so ? 1.295267744355328
They were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs . 2.51188643150958
Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 3.8746751204561316
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my <UNK> and care . 2.2122162910704493
Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 1.353876180022544
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . 10.000000000000002
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 1.4585940117250362
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . 3.8746751204561316
She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 1.6681005372000588
" Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . 1.5848931924611136
" If they had uncles enough to <UNK> all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one <UNK> less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . 1.5848931924611136
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now . 5.179474679231212
<UNK> , wretched , mistake ! " Darcy made no answer . 6.812920690579612
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 3.359818286283782
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s foot <UNK> , that she said , ' Mr . Collins , you must marry . 2.610157215682537
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 4.641588833612778
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she <UNK> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . " Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . 1.3768571648527583
In understanding Darcy was the superior . 26.82695795279726
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? 10.000000000000002
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 1.632172128563275
A small sum could not do all this . " " No , " said her father , " Wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a <UNK> less than ten thousand pounds . 1.8329807108324359
<UNK> and <UNK> I can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart . 2.610157215682537
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many <UNK> of that nature . 1.6496480740980204
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . 5.179474679231212
You provide , in accordance with paragraph . F . , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and <UNK> to you within days of receipt of the work . 1.632172128563275
They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <UNK> <UNK> and head <UNK> there is not much the matter with me . 1.7534865500829584
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
" <UNK> Oh ! 316.22776601683796
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have <UNK> either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . 1.632172128563275
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she <UNK> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . 1.4412195967188537
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away . 1.9684194472866121
so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to every body . That is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . " " Did Charlotte dine with you ? " " No , she would go home . 1.4677992676220695
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . " " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal <UNK> of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first <UNK> for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . 1.2843862635897427
It became her turn to listen . 26.82695795279726
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . 4.216965034285822
My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them . 5.878016072274914
She opened the door , and met Maria in the <UNK> place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza ! 2.2122162910704493
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the <UNK> on guard , and dressing a <UNK> and <UNK> . 2.0092330025650473
If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 2.610157215682537
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . 5.878016072274914
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 1.5085907086001784
" They will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . 1.7082763938087104
But you do not know all . 26.82695795279726
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . 2.8480358684358014
Come be quick , be quick ! 26.82695795279726
But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . 1.5706464294715548
She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent . 1.5706464294715548
In the first place , she persisted in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might be broken off . 1.5441135899948315
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 3.593813663804627
" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of <UNK> in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ' s regard for me . 1.7534865500829584
Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley . 2.0535250264571463
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 3.359818286283782
<UNK> back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise . 1.2478254704700218
I wonder who first discovered the <UNK> of poetry in driving away love ! " " I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy . 2.0092330025650473
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 1.3485595530525598
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . 10.000000000000002
He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . 5.179474679231212
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much . 1.5441135899948315
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . 2.8480358684358014
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which were scattered over the <UNK> lawn . 1.8632463119315603
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . 4.641588833612778
" And that , " said Mrs . 17.78279410038923
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 8.11130830789687
The Miss <UNK> all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . Do you draw ? " " No , not at all . " " What , none of you ? " " Not one . " " That is very strange . 1.557068404753731
and it was not wholly without foundation . 17.78279410038923
Her ease and good spirits increased . 26.82695795279726
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . " " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . 1.5848931924611136
Where does discretion end , and <UNK> begin ? 12.915496650148839
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . " Mrs . 3.359818286283782
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 2.154434690031884
Elizabeth silently attended her . 100.00000000000004
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! " cried Elizabeth when she had finished it . 5.179474679231212
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . 5.179474679231212
What are you telling Miss Bennet ? 26.82695795279726
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
CHAPTER X . 2154.4346900318833
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . 1.93069772888325
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs . 17.78279410038923
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a <UNK> space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . 1.3894954943731377
The day of his and Lydia ' s departure soon came , and Mrs . 4.641588833612778
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
Forster and me are such friends ! and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? 1.7301957388458942
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all <UNK> , if she <UNK> more , and could have the advantage of a London master . 1.7301957388458942
" Yours , c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a <UNK> fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . " " Oh ! 1.3894954943731377
" Oh ! " said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . 2.51188643150958
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
It was very little less . 46.415888336127786
At present we have nothing to guide us . 12.915496650148839
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> . 1.8957356524063758
You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in <UNK> those kind of schemes , and <UNK> a person of their <UNK> contempt . 1.6876124757881477
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . 3.1622776601683795
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . 4.216965034285822
It must be his own doing . He is his own master . 5.878016072274914
On both sides it was only assertion . 17.78279410038923
I am quite well . 100.00000000000004
Kitty and Lydia were far from <UNK> Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . 1.8329807108324359
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 5.179474679231212
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s . 3.8746751204561316
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . 1.4873521072935114
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . 1.3894954943731377
It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ? 3.8746751204561316
If a woman <UNK> her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . 1.7301957388458942
" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt . 2.51188643150958
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . " " In what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought Elizabeth . 1.9684194472866121
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! 3.593813663804627
She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 2.346228848142263
Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . 4.216965034285822
The supposition did not pain her . 26.82695795279726
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not <UNK> their own , so much the better . 2.8480358684358014
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . 1.615598098439874
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 2.8480358684358014
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set <UNK> . 3.1622776601683795
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia . 2.8480358684358014
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 2.0092330025650473
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . 3.1622776601683795
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . 1.8632463119315603
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . 2.2122162910704493
There was no help for it however . 17.78279410038923
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . 2.8480358684358014
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . 8.11130830789687
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . 1.4977474763452014
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 1.8957356524063758
It is almost past belief . 46.415888336127786
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease . 2.2122162910704493
Not a soul knew of it , but <UNK> . 10.000000000000002
If there were but such another man for you ! " " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . 2.1017480113324885
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . 5.179474679231212
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 1.4677992676220695
<UNK> Lady Catherine as well as you can . 12.915496650148839
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . 1.5706464294715548
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . 2.4244620170823286
Bennet with civil self command to Miss Lucas . 12.915496650148839
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . " " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . " To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <UNK> of an elegant female . 1.1721022975334803
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 5.878016072274914
They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! 2.346228848142263
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . 2.2122162910704493
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were <UNK> to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . 1.4330125702369627
But gracious me ! 316.22776601683796
He has heartily <UNK> me now . " Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . 1.8632463119315603
Make haste , and come down this moment . " Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . 1.4977474763452014
So much the better . 100.00000000000004
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . 2.0535250264571463
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . 2.4244620170823286
" Kitty and I are going <UNK> to sit in my dressing room . " Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room . 1.615598098439874
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? 8.11130830789687
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . 3.8746751204561316
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all <UNK> , was still <UNK> <UNK> . 2.51188643150958
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might <UNK> to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . 1.53174046370208
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
But what is that to me ? 26.82695795279726
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 6.812920690579612
dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . 5.878016072274914
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . " " Aye that is because you have the right disposition . 2.346228848142263
Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go . 2.2122162910704493
You give me fresh life and <UNK> . 17.78279410038923
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 8.11130830789687
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . 2.51188643150958
I think she will be pleased with the <UNK> . " Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs . 2.1017480113324885
Lady Catherine ' s great attentions to Mrs . 12.915496650148839
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . 1.7301957388458942
Oh , Lizzy ! 316.22776601683796
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . " Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right . 1.9684194472866121
Bennet was <UNK> in her acknowledgments . 26.82695795279726
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 1.6496480740980204
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . " Elizabeth could not <UNK> a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . 1.3894954943731377
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . " " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth . 1.4873521072935114
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <UNK> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <UNK> , and paid off every <UNK> of civility to Elizabeth . 1.4873521072935114
You may have drawn him in . " " If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . " " Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? 1.93069772888325
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 2.7213387683753076
<UNK> such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not <UNK> the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . 1.4412195967188537
" You look pale . 100.00000000000004
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 3.593813663804627
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh . 26.82695795279726
CHAPTER <UNK> . 2154.4346900318833
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . 5.878016072274914
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . 2.51188643150958
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 1.8957356524063758

The children have been wanting me this half hour . 10.000000000000002
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 2.154434690031884

Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . 26.82695795279726
When the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , <UNK> her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment <UNK> . 1.4977474763452014

such an openness and gentleness in his manner . " " There certainly was some great <UNK> in the education of those two young men . 2.4244620170823286
We must have Mrs . 100.00000000000004
Catherine , weak <UNK> , irritable , and completely under Lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self <UNK> and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . 1.8329807108324359
She is grown so <UNK> and <UNK> ! 17.78279410038923
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 3.1622776601683795
My fingers wait your orders . " " Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . " " Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1.4773776525985112
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away . 2.9935772947204895
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat <UNK> attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must <UNK> every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <UNK> . 1.4030037231905736
She had even learnt to <UNK> , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a <UNK> to disgust and weary . 2.346228848142263
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open <UNK> rejected . 2.346228848142263
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . 8.11130830789687
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 3.359818286283782
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? " " I think she will . 2.0535250264571463
I have no pleasure in talking to <UNK> children . Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body . 2.7213387683753076
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . " " If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . 1.4497406703726319
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 2.610157215682537
Her cousin <UNK> his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the <UNK> of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh .

She performed her part indeed without much <UNK> , but Mrs . 6.812920690579612
My father , however , is partial to Mr . Wickham . 6.812920690579612

Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . <UNK> staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . 1.2175031274276027
Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began . 1.5848931924611136
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . 4.641588833612778
Who would have thought it ! 46.415888336127786
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed ! 6.812920690579612
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object . 5.179474679231212
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! 2.154434690031884
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr . Darcy , she moved again towards the gate . 2.1017480113324885
Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 2.7213387683753076
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 1.8632463119315603
But here , by carrying with me one <UNK> source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <UNK> . 2.0535250264571463
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . 3.1622776601683795
I hope you have destroyed the letter . 17.78279410038923
His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . 2.0092330025650473
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the <UNK> , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening . 1.2260144114527525
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago . 5.179474679231212
The <UNK> letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 1.9684194472866121
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew . 8.11130830789687
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
By this time she is actually with them ! 12.915496650148839
Your sweetness and <UNK> are really <UNK> ; I do not know what to say to you . 3.593813663804627
Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . 2.4244620170823286
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 1.4873521072935114
Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . 4.216965034285822
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <UNK> every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were <UNK> abroad . 1.7301957388458942
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> . 2.0535250264571463
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . 2.51188643150958
While these <UNK> born notions were passing in their <UNK> , the perturbation of Elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . 2.7213387683753076
" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . 1.7301957388458942
Their visits to Mrs . 100.00000000000004
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 1.5848931924611136
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <UNK> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 2.154434690031884
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so <UNK> courted you . 1.5848931924611136
was not a man to be trusted . 17.78279410038923
" Yours , c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . 1.9684194472866121
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . 10.000000000000002
One day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . 2.2122162910704493
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . 3.593813663804627
" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . " Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . 1.5706464294715548
The Foundation ' s principal office is located at <UNK> Dr . S . 5.179474679231212
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 1.2505106035854068
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . 4.641588833612778
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 1.632172128563275
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . 1.41011239906908
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> . 5.179474679231212
A younger son , you know , must be <UNK> to self denial and dependence . " " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either . 1.93069772888325
The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . 3.593813663804627
Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 2.2122162910704493
" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir . 5.878016072274914
" Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair . 5.878016072274914
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . 6.812920690579612
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ? 1.4977474763452014
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 3.1622776601683795
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . 4.641588833612778
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <UNK> <UNK> her there . 3.8746751204561316
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 1.5848931924611136
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . 2.7213387683753076
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . " " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . 1.6681005372000588
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 1.8047217668271702
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . 2.2122162910704493
His surprise was great . 100.00000000000004
I know your disposition , Lizzy . 26.82695795279726
She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <UNK> in so small a family as her ' s , and <UNK> her as to the care of her <UNK> and her poultry . 1.4497406703726319
These recollections will not do at all . 17.78279410038923
They <UNK> their wretchedness , however , by <UNK> after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . 1.7082763938087104
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 1.8047217668271702

Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and <UNK> heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 1.6681005372000588
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
She felt <UNK> the justice of Mr . Darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 2.0092330025650473
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . 4.641588833612778
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day . " " Oh , yes . 2.154434690031884
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 1.53174046370208
how I laughed ! 316.22776601683796
and what can he have to say ? " " Something very much to the purpose of course . 3.359818286283782
I knew how it would be . 26.82695795279726
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 1.6681005372000588
Lady Catherine was <UNK> proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her . 2.7213387683753076
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason . 1.632172128563275
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 1.2618568830660204
But make a virtue of it by all means . 10.000000000000002
He readily agreed to it . 46.415888336127786
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . 2.346228848142263
I knew that Mr . Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . 5.878016072274914
As no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins ' s scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
Does he know his real character ? " " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . 2.4244620170823286
Where shall you change horses ? Oh ! 17.78279410038923
" I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the <UNK> and public places . 2.610157215682537
His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry <UNK> , his wife may teach him . 2.1017480113324885
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s <UNK> her coming so far alone . 2.0535250264571463
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . 4.216965034285822
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . 1.632172128563275
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . 2.1017480113324885
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 2.2122162910704493
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? 8.11130830789687
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 4.216965034285822
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . " " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " And how impossible in others ! " " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? " " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . 1.2401035305418566
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . 4.216965034285822
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 12.915496650148839
Jenkinson ' s room . 100.00000000000004
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus <UNK> my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to <UNK> your authority in my behalf . 1.53174046370208
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some <UNK> , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings . 1.6681005372000588
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter . 1.8957356524063758
But these things happen so often ! 26.82695795279726
" You quite <UNK> Mr . Darcy . 17.78279410038923
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ' s way . " Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <UNK> . 1.5998587196060583
But , really , I know not what to say . 8.11130830789687
In such an <UNK> my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I <UNK> upon his goodness . " " Oh ! 1.8047217668271702
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of <UNK> and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 1.778279410038923
I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . " " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . 1.5085907086001784
But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he <UNK> that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 1.3485595530525598
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 5.179474679231212
<UNK> to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . 1.8329807108324359
Your ' s , c . " Mr . Darcy ' s letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last . 1.6496480740980204
END OF THE <UNK> <UNK> . 46.415888336127786
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 3.1622776601683795
Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their <UNK> in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . 1.3708385261355818
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? " Nothing less than the complaisance of a <UNK> could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most <UNK> courtesy . 1.324192791886045
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 1.5848931924611136
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . 1.3768571648527583
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane . 8.11130830789687
" I admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he . 4.641588833612778
Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to <UNK> . 1.8329807108324359
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year . 2.2758459260747883
Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley . 4.216965034285822
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . 12.915496650148839
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions . 1.8329807108324359
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 10.000000000000002
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and <UNK> mercenary ; and the <UNK> of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to <UNK> at any thing . 1.778279410038923
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . 1.632172128563275
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " Elizabeth could not but look surprised . 1.6876124757881477
How is such a man to be worked on ? 10.000000000000002
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . " It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . 1.7534865500829584
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . 2.610157215682537
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . 3.1622776601683795
Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . 1.7082763938087104
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . 1.6876124757881477
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself . 1.632172128563275
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <UNK> by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . 1.5848931924611136
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his <UNK> , all honoured with the <UNK> of <UNK> , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . 1.8957356524063758
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . 10.000000000000002
It will not do . 100.00000000000004
Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side . 2.0535250264571463
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States . 3.593813663804627
They were to be off as soon as possible . 10.000000000000002
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 1.8329807108324359
I was given good <UNK> , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 4.216965034285822
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ; but his <UNK> about the whole Pemberley family are endless . 2.1017480113324885
You know my sentiments . " " You are then resolved to have him ? " " I have said no such thing . 2.610157215682537
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 3.359818286283782
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 1.8047217668271702
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 1.9684194472866121
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . 2.2758459260747883
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? 1.5706464294715548
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 2.1017480113324885
Let me hear from you very soon . 17.78279410038923
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . " As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . 1.333521432163324
Bennet <UNK> the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . 5.179474679231212
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . 3.1622776601683795
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 6.812920690579612
But really , Ma ' am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . 1.4585940117250362
Had Elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . 2.2122162910704493
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much . 6.812920690579612
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . 1.6876124757881477
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . 2.1017480113324885
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister ' s being in town . 2.9935772947204895

It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with <UNK> all the <UNK> explanations . 2.8480358684358014
" He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . 2.9935772947204895
On Saturday he came again . 46.415888336127786
I have not that pain . 46.415888336127786
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way . 3.1622776601683795
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by <UNK> a <UNK> , or covering a <UNK> . 2.610157215682537
Section . 100000.00000000001
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be <UNK> from it . 2.2122162910704493
" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister . 2.0535250264571463
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . 2.51188643150958
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . 17.78279410038923
She was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . 1.53174046370208
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . 5.878016072274914
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 1.8329807108324359
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " With such kind of <UNK> of their parties and good <UNK> , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . 1.5199110829529336
Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her . 6.812920690579612
Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . 4.641588833612778
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . 2.154434690031884
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . 1.8329807108324359
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <UNK> to that evening , " said Elizabeth . 2.2122162910704493
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . 8.11130830789687
She practises very constantly . " " So much the better . 6.812920690579612
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 8.11130830789687
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . 2.9935772947204895
" This is wholly unexpected . 46.415888336127786
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 1.53174046370208
It was then <UNK> in the following manner . 12.915496650148839
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . 1.8329807108324359
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it <UNK> , has surprised me a good deal . 1.9684194472866121
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . " Miss Bennet eagerly <UNK> all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . 1.778279410038923
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . 2.610157215682537
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . 8.11130830789687
<UNK> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all . 1.6876124757881477

I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 1.4412195967188537
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two . 4.216965034285822
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled . " A gentleman and a stranger ! 5.878016072274914
The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 1.6876124757881477
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 1.8329807108324359
what could she mean by it ? 26.82695795279726
His disposition must be dreadful . " " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . " Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from <UNK> , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! " " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; <UNK> of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same <UNK> care . 1.1468953964666422
" They have both , " said she , " been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . 2.1017480113324885
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 3.593813663804627
What is your own opinion ? " " That it ought not to be attempted . 4.216965034285822
What relates to yourself , is as follows . 12.915496650148839
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
You must not suspect me . 46.415888336127786
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
What a contrast between him and his friend ! 12.915496650148839
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 2.610157215682537
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . 2.51188643150958
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time . 2.9935772947204895
You do not look well . 46.415888336127786
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she . 5.179474679231212
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? 6.812920690579612
I will only add , God bless you . 12.915496650148839
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some <UNK> neighbour , who could not be enough <UNK> , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 1.5085907086001784
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 1.5085907086001784
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . 6.812920690579612
" My aunt , " she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor street . " She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley . 1.5998587196060583
Again she read on . 100.00000000000004
" Oh , yes ! if one could but go to Brighton ! 5.878016072274914
Let Wickham be your man . 46.415888336127786
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . " Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . 1.4497406703726319
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . 3.8746751204561316
" What do you think ? 46.415888336127786
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure . " The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs . 1.4174741629268053
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . 1.5848931924611136
Her <UNK> are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . 1.8632463119315603
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . 5.878016072274914
But that is not the case here . 17.78279410038923
Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . 1.5706464294715548
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , <UNK> painful to me . 1.8632463119315603
He is so excessively handsome ! 46.415888336127786
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <UNK> to her <UNK> , afforded no <UNK> of her distress . 2.2758459260747883
To know that her daughter would be married was enough . 8.11130830789687
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . 4.216965034285822
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . 6.812920690579612
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . 1.8047217668271702
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 1.632172128563275
who attended to you ? 100.00000000000004
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
That is the place to get husbands . 17.78279410038923
My temper I dare not vouch for . It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world . 2.51188643150958
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man . 1.93069772888325
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . 10.000000000000002
Hurst was observing their game . 46.415888336127786
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . " CHAPTER V . 3.359818286283782
Let me never see either one or the other again ! " Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no <UNK> , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re <UNK> the admiration of her former lover . 1.5706464294715548
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s . 4.216965034285822
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , <UNK> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 2.4244620170823286
It <UNK> me , I confess ; for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . 2.9935772947204895
His reception however was of the most flattering kind . 10.000000000000002
He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable house . 3.593813663804627
He drew a chair near her . 26.82695795279726
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . " " I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . " " Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . " " That is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . 1.365007806546014
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . 1.7534865500829584
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . 6.812920690579612
We were always good friends ; and now we are better . " " True . 4.216965034285822
It will save me a world of trouble and economy . 8.11130830789687
Not handsome enough to dance with ! 26.82695795279726
Is not he a charming man ? 26.82695795279726
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach . 2.610157215682537
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 5.179474679231212
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My <UNK> were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte . 1.425102670302998
The others have been gone on to <UNK> , these three weeks . " She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . 1.8329807108324359
It is really too distressing . 46.415888336127786
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they <UNK> with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy . 1.3830728955554412
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 1.4330125702369627
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . 1.6681005372000588
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! 5.179474679231212
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <UNK> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . 2.51188643150958
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
" Can you come to morrow ? " Yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 2.2758459260747883
" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? " said she . 5.878016072274914
But who was your mother ? 46.415888336127786
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 2.0535250264571463
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 4.641588833612778
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 1.778279410038923
" I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . 2.154434690031884
Bennet , was not so well pleased with it . 10.000000000000002
His belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 1.7082763938087104
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy . 3.1622776601683795
. F . . LIMITED <UNK> OF <UNK> OR <UNK> If you discover a defect in this electronic work within days of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from . 1.5441135899948315
" You are <UNK> , Lizzy . 26.82695795279726
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 3.1622776601683795
The next was in these words . 26.82695795279726
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due . " " My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . 1.302994338575022
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 1.2005080577484075
But here he was set right by Mrs . 12.915496650148839
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement <UNK> the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be <UNK> to make the <UNK> disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law . 1.778279410038923
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . 8.11130830789687
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments . 2.610157215682537
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . 1.8329807108324359
" I expected at least that the <UNK> were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! " " La ! 2.2122162910704493
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 1.6876124757881477
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . 8.11130830789687
Reynolds could interest her on no other point . 12.915496650148839
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . 1.5848931924611136
" Did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ? 3.359818286283782
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . 2.2758459260747883
I told my sister Philips so the other day . 10.000000000000002
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
Sir William did not say much . 26.82695795279726
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 1.5199110829529336
Is this to be endured ! 46.415888336127786
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned . 1.4873521072935114
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . " " Good <UNK> ! " cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? How could his will be <UNK> ? Why did not you seek legal <UNK> ? " " There was just such an <UNK> in the terms of the <UNK> as to give me no hope from law . 1.333521432163324
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 1.5848931924611136
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome . 1.778279410038923
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . 4.641588833612778
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . 2.0092330025650473
Miss Darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . 1.5998587196060583
intending to trace their route . 46.415888336127786
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . 1.5199110829529336
He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . 3.593813663804627
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " " Ten thousand pounds ! 2.51188643150958
Never mind Miss Lizzy ' s hair . " " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . " " Oh ! 1.5706464294715548
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance <UNK> , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . 2.7213387683753076
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling <UNK> on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give . 1.2560585988318853
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . 1.4677992676220695
" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she . 4.216965034285822
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 3.593813663804627
Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . " " To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart . 1.242623671911505
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 1.4585940117250362
It was a large , handsome , <UNK> building , standing well on rising ground , and <UNK> by a <UNK> of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was <UNK> into greater , but without any <UNK> appearance . 1.632172128563275
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 1.3830728955554412
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . " " I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which <UNK> in <UNK> a respectable man . 1.396135390856794
Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Mr . Collins began . 3.593813663804627
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily <UNK> seeing him , till after the departure of the former . 1.93069772888325
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 1.7534865500829584
" I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five <UNK> any object . 1.615598098439874
Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . 2.0535250264571463
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . " " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . 1.5706464294715548
And to be kept back on such a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . " " Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? " " With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . " Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . 1.2175031274276027
Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . 8.11130830789687
He is perfectly amiable . 100.00000000000004
Mr . Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . 2.51188643150958
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . 10.000000000000002
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 1.615598098439874
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . 1.8632463119315603
Bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at <UNK> , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to <UNK> you when your father is dead . I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . 1.1787686347935873
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . 1.7301957388458942
Bennet . They had several children . 26.82695795279726
She <UNK> the days that must <UNK> before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . 3.1622776601683795
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her <UNK> spirits , and of teaching her that her present <UNK> are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 1.6496480740980204
Philips ' s manners and politeness . 26.82695795279726
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in <UNK> it after this explanation . " Mr . Darcy , who was <UNK> against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . 1.4677992676220695
Lord bless me ! 316.22776601683796
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so doubtful , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea . 1.4030037231905736
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . 2.4244620170823286
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 2.9935772947204895
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 1.2843862635897427
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 2.7213387683753076
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . 3.8746751204561316
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <UNK> as these , what would have been her sensations ? 2.4244620170823286
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . 4.641588833612778
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? 5.878016072274914
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . 10.000000000000002
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged . 1.778279410038923
Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very <UNK> said , " What is the matter mamma ? 2.51188643150958
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . 3.359818286283782
<UNK> , selfish girl ! 100.00000000000004
<UNK> wore a happier aspect . 46.415888336127786
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . 5.878016072274914
<UNK> wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . 1.6681005372000588
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 10.000000000000002
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . 2.8480358684358014
Collins , did I tell you of Lady <UNK> ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? 3.8746751204561316
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a <UNK> , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . " " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . 1.2648552168552962
She represented to him all the <UNK> of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . 2.154434690031884
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . " " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be . 1.2742749857031337
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . " " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 1.4030037231905736
But I confess they would have no charms for me . 8.11130830789687
Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> . 1.778279410038923
There can be no love in all this . 12.915496650148839
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned . 1.2238249369681928
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 10.000000000000002
Pray read on . " " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she <UNK> so disgraceful a match . 1.3894954943731377
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 5.179474679231212
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 1.2710617996147449
A great deal more passed at the other table . 10.000000000000002
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so . 4.216965034285822
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! 3.593813663804627
but from what the report of their engagement could <UNK> , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . 1.4330125702369627
After playing some <UNK> <UNK> , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to <UNK> such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " She smiled , but made no answer . 1.4497406703726319
I shall now know how to act . 17.78279410038923
I hope he will overlook it . 26.82695795279726
How he lived I know not . 26.82695795279726
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . " " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be <UNK> with . 1.632172128563275
He cannot know what Mr . Darcy is . " " <UNK> not ; but Mr . Darcy can please where he chuses . 2.610157215682537
Philips . The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . 4.641588833612778
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 2.7213387683753076
<UNK> of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . " Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready <UNK> . 1.7301957388458942
Bennet was <UNK> engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <UNK> them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather <UNK> than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . 1.3894954943731377
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of <UNK> , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . 1.3070104796093682
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . " He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 1.2401035305418566
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 17.78279410038923
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 1.5199110829529336
" I do not get on at all . 12.915496650148839
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . 1.4773776525985112
But it was not to be . 26.82695795279726
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . 2.2758459260747883
it cannot be . 316.22776601683796
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . 5.179474679231212
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . 1.8632463119315603
I am so pleased so happy . 26.82695795279726
What could your ladyship propose by it ? " " At once to insist upon having such a report universally <UNK> . " " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . " " If ! 1.4174741629268053
Caroline is incapable of wilfully <UNK> any one ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . " " That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine . 1.5706464294715548
They all <UNK> tables , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
Hurst began again . 316.22776601683796
Mr . Collins received and returned these <UNK> with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <UNK> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 1.4412195967188537
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . 3.593813663804627
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . " " Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly . 1.93069772888325
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . 2.154434690031884
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . 2.0092330025650473
But now it comes out . " " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows . 3.593813663804627
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and <UNK> in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . 1.8957356524063758
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . 5.179474679231212
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . 5.878016072274914
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 1.4677992676220695
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> . 4.216965034285822
it is just as he <UNK> . 26.82695795279726
To Mr . and Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to <UNK> it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . 1.9684194472866121
CHAPTER XIX . 2154.4346900318833
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the <UNK> of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . 1.365007806546014
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house . 5.179474679231212
It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be <UNK> , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham . 1.7534865500829584
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . 3.1622776601683795
my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . " " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . 1.3768571648527583
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . 6.812920690579612
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . 1.6496480740980204
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . 4.641588833612778
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 2.4244620170823286
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . 5.878016072274914
" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . " " You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . 2.4244620170823286
There is no indignity so <UNK> to their feelings ! " She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " " And quite alone ? 1.4585940117250362
' Ah ! 2154.4346900318833
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <UNK> . " " And this is your real opinion ! 1.4497406703726319
The evening passed quietly , <UNK> by any thing extraordinary . 8.11130830789687
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday . 1.3593563908785256
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . 1.8329807108324359
Long has promised to introduce him . " " I do not believe Mrs . 4.641588833612778
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <UNK> <UNK> better than <UNK> ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 1.1874815363065987
But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my <UNK> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . 1.615598098439874
It is unaccountable ! 316.22776601683796
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 1.8047217668271702
He studies too much for words of four <UNK> . Do not you , Darcy ? " " My style of writing is very different from yours . " " Oh ! " cried Miss Bingley , " Charles <UNK> in the most careless way imaginable . 1.632172128563275
However , if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg tm work in a format other than " Plain Vanilla ASCII " or other format used in the official <UNK> posted on the official Project Gutenberg tm web site www . gutenberg . org , you must , at no additional cost , fee or expense to the user , provide a copy , a means of <UNK> a copy , or a means of obtaining a copy upon request , of the work in its original " Plain Vanilla ASCII " or other form . 1.2589254117941673
She directly replied , " You need not be frightened . 8.11130830789687
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . " Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . 1.6681005372000588
But I know the foundation is unjust . 17.78279410038923
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by <UNK> the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . 1.5848931924611136
Gardiner . 100000.00000000001
We have not met since the th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . " Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when <UNK> to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn . 1.5085907086001784
I cannot understand it . 100.00000000000004
She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . 1.778279410038923
Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 10.000000000000002
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it . 4.641588833612778
Well , but now for my news it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? 2.7213387683753076
" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr . Darcy ? " " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . " " I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . 1.2560585988318853
dear me ! 2154.4346900318833
With them he is remarkably agreeable . " " I do not believe a word of it , my dear . 2.9935772947204895
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . 2.154434690031884
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ' s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . 1.8957356524063758
Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a <UNK> chaise . " " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . 2.154434690031884
CHAPTER XIX . 2154.4346900318833
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . 8.11130830789687
But that is nothing to us . 26.82695795279726
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette . 5.878016072274914
From that moment I observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 2.0092330025650473
Bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone . 10.000000000000002
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed . 1.5441135899948315
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as , by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . 1.4677992676220695
I always said it must be so , at last . 8.11130830789687
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be <UNK> so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . 2.2122162910704493
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs . 8.11130830789687
" It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . 3.1622776601683795
There is nothing he would not do for her . " The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . 2.0092330025650473
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . " The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they <UNK> satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had <UNK> Mrs . 1.396135390856794
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? " " Oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all . 2.154434690031884
CHAPTER XI . 2154.4346900318833
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " " That you certainly shall . " " And I have another favour to ask . 1.778279410038923
Besides , it will not much signify what one <UNK> this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . " " Are they indeed ? " cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . 1.7082763938087104
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 2.51188643150958
I shall go distracted . " This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . 1.8957356524063758
Elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 1.6496480740980204
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? 3.593813663804627
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 3.8746751204561316
This was very amiable , but Charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . 1.6496480740980204
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . 4.641588833612778
This was agreed to , and Mrs . 17.78279410038923
She answered with equal indifference and <UNK> , and the other said no more . 4.641588833612778
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . 2.9935772947204895
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <UNK> at the <UNK> of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time <UNK> her natural degree of sense , since the <UNK> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be <UNK> , was likely to be <UNK> in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a <UNK> place and a camp . 1.2532543355087804
Has it not been <UNK> <UNK> by yourselves ? 12.915496650148839
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s . 2.154434690031884
The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of <UNK> , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her <UNK> <UNK> . 1.3708385261355818
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 10.000000000000002
Thank God ! 2154.4346900318833
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 2.4244620170823286
You thought me then <UNK> of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . 4.216965034285822
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . 10.000000000000002
She was humbled , she was grieved ; she <UNK> , though she hardly knew of what . 3.593813663804627
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 1.7301957388458942
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 8.11130830789687
The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . 1.93069772888325
Hill began instantly to express her joy . 17.78279410038923
" DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations . 5.179474679231212
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . " Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . 1.93069772888325
Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . 4.641588833612778
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? 4.641588833612778
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 1.7301957388458942
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . 2.9935772947204895
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 2.2122162910704493
At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s <UNK> him entirely , for she was a most determined <UNK> ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making <UNK> and exclaiming after <UNK> , to have attention for any one in particular . 1.4773776525985112
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <UNK> her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 1.5998587196060583
No one but Mrs . 100.00000000000004
what has she to do with it ? 17.78279410038923
" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech . 2.9935772947204895
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was Elizabeth ' s intimate friend . 2.7213387683753076
What a fine thing for our girls ! " " How so ? 5.878016072274914
He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 1.8329807108324359
Philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly <UNK> the invitation . 5.179474679231212
What could be more natural than his asking you again ? 8.11130830789687
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . 2.154434690031884
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . 2.7213387683753076
I know no harm of her . " " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her <UNK> ' s death made her mistress of this fortune . " " No why should he ? 1.8329807108324359
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ' s visit . 1.6876124757881477
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have <UNK> domestic felicity in so <UNK> a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . 1.3070104796093682
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . 2.154434690031884
Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . 5.179474679231212
how rich and how great you will be ! 12.915496650148839
Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant <UNK> to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " I do not know . I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult . 1.53174046370208
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 3.8746751204561316
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . 5.179474679231212
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half expectation which Mrs . 2.8480358684358014
" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? " Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . 1.8632463119315603
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . 26.82695795279726
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . 2.610157215682537
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 4.641588833612778
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . " Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . 1.9684194472866121
And his behaviour , so <UNK> altered , what could it mean ? 5.878016072274914
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! 8.11130830789687
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 2.154434690031884
What do I not owe you ! 26.82695795279726
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy . 12.915496650148839
I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 2.2758459260747883
Mr . Collins ' s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . 3.593813663804627
Hurst were going out . 100.00000000000004
Yes , I call it a very easy distance . " " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth . 2.0535250264571463
" Yet why did he come ? " She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . 2.1017480113324885
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 1.3593563908785256
She had got rid of two of the <UNK> which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . 1.8329807108324359
" Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our <UNK> way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . " Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and <UNK> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 1.396135390856794
" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . 3.8746751204561316
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . 1.5706464294715548
He was my <UNK> , and excessively attached to me . 8.11130830789687
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . 1.4873521072935114
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him . 4.641588833612778
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? 8.11130830789687
" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . 2.51188643150958
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . 12.915496650148839
What congratulations will then flow in ! 26.82695795279726
They could describe an entertainment with <UNK> , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . 2.8480358684358014
Your ' s , c . 46.415888336127786
The <UNK> or <UNK> of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
" Oh , Lizzy ! 100.00000000000004
" I cannot make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by <UNK> for being next in the entail ? We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " No , my dear ; I think not . 1.4497406703726319
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to <UNK> the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 2.154434690031884
When they repaired to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 1.8632463119315603
Had his character been known , this could not have happened . 6.812920690579612
Bennet . 100000.00000000001
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . 1.5085907086001784
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! 6.812920690579612
" You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . " As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the <UNK> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . 1.4585940117250362
who could have done less for her ? 17.78279410038923
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ' s character . " Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " <UNK> there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 1.632172128563275
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! 4.641588833612778
It must be an amusing study . " " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing . 3.359818286283782
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . 8.11130830789687
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not . 1.9684194472866121
" I am , dear Sir , c . 12.915496650148839
Her report was highly favourable . 46.415888336127786
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 2.7213387683753076
On the following Monday , Mrs . 26.82695795279726
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . " " That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever heard you utter . 1.396135390856794
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . 1.93069772888325
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 5.878016072274914
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . 5.179474679231212
But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . " " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " Yes . 1.7301957388458942
These were the contents " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . 1.7534865500829584
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . " " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister . 1.3894954943731377
She does not yet leave her dressing room . 12.915496650148839
This cannot be ! engaged to Mr . Darcy ! 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did . 1.632172128563275
To Caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit . 3.1622776601683795
" Of a fine , stout , <UNK> love it may . 6.812920690579612
<UNK> the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it cannot be long . " He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . 1.4030037231905736
Mr . Darcy ! 316.22776601683796
We seem to have been designed for each other . " Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she <UNK> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . 1.6876124757881477
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . 2.4244620170823286
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley ' s heart were entertained . 2.2758459260747883
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . 3.8746751204561316
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . " The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . 1.8632463119315603
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 2.8480358684358014
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley . 10.000000000000002
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . 2.2758459260747883
Good bye . 2154.4346900318833
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . 2.610157215682537
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 2.51188643150958
But she would not be secure . 26.82695795279726
CHAPTER VII . 2154.4346900318833
She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . 1.5085907086001784
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . 2.7213387683753076
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 1.557068404753731
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . 2.0535250264571463
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . 2.7213387683753076
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <UNK> of a bad day . 2.4244620170823286
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 3.1622776601683795
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . " <UNK> by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did . 1.4497406703726319
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of <UNK> . " He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . 1.3708385261355818
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . 5.878016072274914
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 17.78279410038923
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . 8.11130830789687
I had hoped that our sentiments <UNK> in every particular , but I must so far <UNK> from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . " " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . 1.365007806546014
This letter is from Mr . Collins . " " From Mr . Collins ! 4.641588833612778
' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! What , all five out at once ? 1.5848931924611136
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . 4.641588833612778
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W . 2.51188643150958
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal . " " True . 2.7213387683753076
I speak <UNK> . 316.22776601683796
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 26.82695795279726
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . 5.179474679231212
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library . " Mrs . 1.202264434617413
Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . 1.7301957388458942
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . 3.8746751204561316
" I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could . 2.51188643150958
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . 2.346228848142263
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly <UNK> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . 1.7534865500829584
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out . She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . 1.302994338575022
<UNK> an only son , for many years an only child I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , my father particularly , all that was <UNK> and amiable , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and <UNK> , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . 1.3111339374215643
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company . 2.0092330025650473
Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . 2.9935772947204895
how I wanted you ! " " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . " " Certainly . 1.8047217668271702
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " cried Elizabeth . 2.154434690031884
They had long wished to see him . 17.78279410038923
Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt . 3.359818286283782
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . 4.641588833612778
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 2.8480358684358014
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . 2.8480358684358014
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs . 4.216965034285822
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . 2.346228848142263
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back . 10.000000000000002
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . 1.8957356524063758
You take delight in <UNK> me . 26.82695795279726
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 2.8480358684358014
Mr . Darcy ! and so it does I <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . 2.2758459260747883
I never was . 316.22776601683796
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be <UNK> to her nieces . 2.346228848142263
He leaves out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <UNK> . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must <UNK> reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility . 1.3433993325989002
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 2.2122162910704493
" Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " for Mrs . 3.1622776601683795
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to <UNK> the engagements that had been made for him . 1.6681005372000588
Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 2.8480358684358014
He danced only four dances ! 46.415888336127786
CHAPTER VIII . 2154.4346900318833
Their manners are not equal to his . " " Certainly not ; at first . 4.216965034285822

" If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs . 5.878016072274914
But no such recollection <UNK> her . 26.82695795279726
I cannot do justice to his kindness . 17.78279410038923

I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and Mrs . 1.8329807108324359
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 8.11130830789687
do not repeat what I then said . 17.78279410038923
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . 1.8632463119315603
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including <UNK> , online payments and credit card donations . 3.359818286283782
That he was surprised by the <UNK> was evident ; he <UNK> it however with <UNK> , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner . 1.8329807108324359
I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 1.4330125702369627

Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . 1.8957356524063758
Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . 2.4244620170823286
Only look at her . 100.00000000000004
From what can it proceed ? 46.415888336127786
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 8.11130830789687
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and <UNK> them , after a short <UNK> , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . 1.8329807108324359
Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other . 1.5848931924611136
" It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . 4.216965034285822
and so extremely accomplished for her age ! 17.78279410038923
You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . 3.1622776601683795
She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa . 5.179474679231212
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . 6.812920690579612
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . 1.5085907086001784
Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . " Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . 1.7082763938087104
They were in street . 100.00000000000004
Lord ! 100000.00000000001
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him . 1.228247006346923
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not <UNK> a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . 1.4977474763452014
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 1.425102670302998
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 2.154434690031884
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . " Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . 1.632172128563275
He <UNK> , and <UNK> , and makes love to us all . 5.878016072274914
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation . 2.2122162910704493
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 5.878016072274914
" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . 1.93069772888325
<UNK> , of course . If you mention my name at the <UNK> , you will be attended to . " Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . 1.3768571648527583
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . 10.000000000000002
Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general <UNK> , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . 1.6876124757881477
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . 3.593813663804627
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . " " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . 1.6496480740980204
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . " Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . 1.396135390856794
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 1.9684194472866121
You must contrive to send somebody . 26.82695795279726
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . 1.4412195967188537
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . 2.51188643150958
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 2.2122162910704493
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . 4.641588833612778
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 6.812920690579612
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . 4.641588833612778
" But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing . 2.9935772947204895
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with . 1.3708385261355818
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . 2.2758459260747883
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 2.9935772947204895
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 1.4873521072935114
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . 2.51188643150958
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . 1.8632463119315603
His debts are to be paid , <UNK> , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased . 1.8957356524063758
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
If I wished to think <UNK> of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however . " " If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . " " Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . " " This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . 1.365007806546014
Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated . 1.557068404753731
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . 5.878016072274914
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 2.4244620170823286
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . 2.346228848142263
My dear Charles , what do you mean ? " " Yes , all of them , I think . 3.1622776601683795
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . 2.4244620170823286
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 1.8047217668271702
Mr . Bennet ' s <UNK> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! 1.4030037231905736
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general <UNK> to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . 1.632172128563275
I . 100000.00000000001
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . 4.641588833612778
Dear , dear Lizzy . 100.00000000000004
Such a disappointment ! 316.22776601683796
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <UNK> , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 1.4330125702369627
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . 4.216965034285822
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . 6.812920690579612
I hate such false friends . 46.415888336127786
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <UNK> . 2.610157215682537
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . " " Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . 1.6681005372000588
Mr . Darcy <UNK> you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . 3.359818286283782
Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . " " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . " " I believe , Ma ' am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . " " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . 1.2843862635897427
Bennet , having <UNK> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . 1.4773776525985112
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . 17.78279410038923
In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <UNK> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 1.353876180022544
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . 1.5085907086001784
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia ' s leaving home . 2.2758459260747883
The moral will be perfectly fair . 26.82695795279726
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . 6.812920690579612
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more <UNK> , and less <UNK> than the other had ever seen him . 1.8047217668271702
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 1.41011239906908
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . 12.915496650148839
" I am sorry it went off . 17.78279410038923
Bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . 2.9935772947204895
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . 2.4244620170823286
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 1.6876124757881477
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply <UNK> on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . 1.8957356524063758
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . 1.8632463119315603
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . Bingley was <UNK> to Darcy by the easiness , openness , <UNK> of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . 1.4873521072935114
Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . 2.4244620170823286
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . 2.8480358684358014
Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 3.1622776601683795
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . " " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . 1.4330125702369627
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
<UNK> at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . 1.4873521072935114
" But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with <UNK> , and rob it of a few <UNK> <UNK> without his perceiving me . " The period of expectation was now <UNK> . 1.8047217668271702
Adieu . 100000.00000000001
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 5.878016072274914
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . 46.415888336127786
But does not Jane <UNK> with the sister ? 12.915496650148839
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <UNK> . 1.93069772888325
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . 3.593813663804627
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman <UNK> the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . 1.4030037231905736
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design . 1.778279410038923
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 1.5085907086001784
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ' s <UNK> had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or <UNK> in him . 1.6876124757881477
To Mrs . 2154.4346900318833
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . 1.2915496650148839
" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam . 1.2376350284724815
CHAPTER XV . 2154.4346900318833
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . 3.593813663804627
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the <UNK> . 1.4873521072935114
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " CHAPTER <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477
Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . 1.9684194472866121
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . 1.5441135899948315
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . 1.7301957388458942
Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . 3.1622776601683795
my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " Oh , lord ! 2.9935772947204895
Mr . Bennet accepted the <UNK> , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . 2.7213387683753076
It is too long ago . 46.415888336127786
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . 4.641588833612778
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
You must not disappoint your father . " " My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . " " Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . " " Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . 1.615598098439874
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . 1.7301957388458942
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to <UNK> , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to <UNK> his prosperous love . 1.396135390856794
" I should never have said Mrs . 17.78279410038923
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . 1.6876124757881477
She will be down in a moment I dare say . " He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 1.9684194472866121
CHAPTER X . 2154.4346900318833
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 10.000000000000002
Hart was the <UNK> of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone . 2.610157215682537
She will follow wherever Lydia leads . 26.82695795279726
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Mr . Robinson . " " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? 1.5085907086001784
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 1.615598098439874
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 3.1622776601683795
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> . 2.0092330025650473
Elizabeth immediately began playing again . 46.415888336127786
But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Good gracious ! 2154.4346900318833
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . 2.346228848142263
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . 1.7301957388458942
" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her . 3.593813663804627
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long . 2.8480358684358014
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . 1.4412195967188537
It was to this effect " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well . 1.778279410038923
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . 1.6496480740980204
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy . 2.0535250264571463
But think no more of the letter . 17.78279410038923
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 4.641588833612778
I never saw such <UNK> , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " Mrs . 2.610157215682537
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 1.4412195967188537
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 1.4030037231905736
Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! 2.9935772947204895
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity . 1.4497406703726319
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . 17.78279410038923
He begged pardon for having displeased her . 17.78279410038923
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <UNK> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . 2.2758459260747883
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon . 2.346228848142263
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . 5.878016072274914
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 2.2758459260747883
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . 4.216965034285822
And what sort of table do they keep ? 12.915496650148839
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 1.4977474763452014
She has known him only a fortnight . 17.78279410038923
Mr . Collins was carefully <UNK> them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <UNK> them . 1.8957356524063758
The old lady is Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 1.5848931924611136
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . 2.610157215682537
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time . 3.1622776601683795
Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . 2.51188643150958
Not that I care about it , though . 12.915496650148839
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . 1.93069772888325
Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . 2.0092330025650473
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . 5.179474679231212
I know not what to think . 26.82695795279726
<UNK> , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ? 6.812920690579612
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . 5.878016072274914
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . 1.5199110829529336
<UNK> was the least of her feelings on this developement . 8.11130830789687
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two <UNK> with Jane again , and the two <UNK> with Lizzy , and the <UNK> " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! 1.4330125702369627
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . 2.9935772947204895
Elizabeth immediately <UNK> the livery , guessed what it meant , and <UNK> no small degree of surprise to her relations , by <UNK> them with the honour which she expected . 2.0535250264571463
But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . " " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother . 1.8047217668271702
Three daughters married ! 316.22776601683796
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . 2.51188643150958
Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 2.346228848142263
I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " " And they must marry ! 3.8746751204561316
And , besides , no <UNK> of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then supposing them to be in London . 2.2122162910704493
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . " " Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . 1.5706464294715548
I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . " " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <UNK> of you . 1.2742749857031337
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . 1.7082763938087104
" My dear , dear Lydia ! " she cried " This is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing . 1.53174046370208
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . 12.915496650148839
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the <UNK> Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . 1.5085907086001784
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . 2.1017480113324885
came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the <UNK> , and at the <UNK> in Barnet and <UNK> , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . 1.8632463119315603
Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him . 2.4244620170823286
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . 3.593813663804627
" Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . 1.8047217668271702
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . 1.8957356524063758
And do you really love him quite well enough ? 10.000000000000002
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . 10.000000000000002
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 8.11130830789687
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . 1.2990813969063477
Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . 4.216965034285822
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . 3.1622776601683795
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . 1.4677992676220695
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is <UNK> . " " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs . 2.346228848142263
An union of a different tendency , and <UNK> the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . 2.610157215682537
With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were <UNK> understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged . 1.41011239906908
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 1.9684194472866121
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it <UNK> . 1.5706464294715548
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> . 2.8480358684358014
Such was Miss Lucas ' s scheme ; and <UNK> were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . 1.778279410038923
<UNK> <UNK> the face of Mrs . 26.82695795279726
" Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . 4.216965034285822
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 1.615598098439874
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 5.179474679231212
Her father <UNK> by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and <UNK> mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . 1.5998587196060583
I will read you the passage which particularly <UNK> me . 8.11130830789687
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . 1.93069772888325
I am so happy . 100.00000000000004
" I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth . 5.878016072274914
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " Lydia declared herself satisfied . 3.359818286283782
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 1.615598098439874
One seems so <UNK> without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth . 2.346228848142263
<UNK> , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . 1.6876124757881477
She is quite a little creature . 26.82695795279726
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . " " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . " " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . " " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . " " But consider your daughters . 1.3287913432286882
But self , though it would intrude , could not <UNK> her . 5.878016072274914
Let me mend it for you . 26.82695795279726
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional <UNK> in praise of his own humble abode , and the <UNK> it was receiving , he was happily employed <UNK> the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . 1.615598098439874
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . 4.641588833612778
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 10.000000000000002
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present <UNK> of good will are highly <UNK> , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . 1.3287913432286882
Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs . 12.915496650148839
only think ! 2154.4346900318833
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . " " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . 1.557068404753731
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest . 1.8047217668271702
Lydia laughed , and said , " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . 3.593813663804627
A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone . 4.216965034285822
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 1.2352165993694857
She dared not even mention that gentleman . 17.78279410038923
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added <UNK> to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be <UNK> . 1.5848931924611136
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . 2.610157215682537
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means <UNK> or <UNK> , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . 1.5706464294715548
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . " Kitty , who took all these <UNK> in a serious light , began to <UNK> . 1.6496480740980204
But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! 2.2758459260747883
What say you , Mary ? 46.415888336127786
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . 1.8632463119315603
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . 6.812920690579612
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 1.338388753173757
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an <UNK> with her brother for talking such nonsense . 2.9935772947204895
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . 1.6681005372000588
Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . 1.5706464294715548
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1.8632463119315603
They must be a great loss to your family . " In Darcy ' s presence she dared not mention Wickham ' s name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <UNK> in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , <UNK> herself <UNK> to <UNK> the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . 1.3593563908785256
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . 6.812920690579612
Her ladyship ' s carriage is <UNK> ordered for us . 8.11130830789687
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . 3.359818286283782
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . 1.53174046370208
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . " " You are over <UNK> surely . 2.2122162910704493
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . 2.8480358684358014
Mr . Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . 2.0535250264571463
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 2.4244620170823286
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . 2.2122162910704493
She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most <UNK> by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . 1.7534865500829584
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 1.4030037231905736
So near a <UNK> to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart . 2.610157215682537
CHAPTER VIII . 2154.4346900318833
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . " Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . 1.396135390856794
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . 6.812920690579612
They have at least that advantage . " " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . 2.2122162910704493
The extravagance and general <UNK> which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 1.8632463119315603
I wish you had been there . 26.82695795279726
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you . 4.641588833612778
single , my dear , to be sure ! 12.915496650148839
The journey would moreover give her a <UNK> at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . 2.0535250264571463
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! 2.7213387683753076
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . 1.353876180022544
And one of my own daughters . 26.82695795279726
How I long to see her ! 26.82695795279726
Gardiner smiled . 2154.4346900318833
A fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . 10.000000000000002
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . 5.878016072274914
' Tis as good as a Lord ! 17.78279410038923
They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins ' s admiration . 5.179474679231212
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . 3.1622776601683795
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried . 5.878016072274914
Jane <UNK> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour . 1.5199110829529336
There was another reason too for her opposition . 12.915496650148839
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <UNK> from the marriage of her sisters . 3.593813663804627
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 2.9935772947204895
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him . 2.610157215682537
He was full of joy and attention . 17.78279410038923
Jane was by no means better . 26.82695795279726
Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . " " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK> accordingly . " " You did ! 1.353876180022544
The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . 2.4244620170823286
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the <UNK> , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477
<UNK> inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in <UNK> ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the <UNK> Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . 1.4873521072935114
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . 1.202264434617413
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . <UNK> immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . " " What is his name ? " " Bingley . " " Is he married or single ? " " Oh ! 1.2560585988318853
How are they even to be discovered ? 17.78279410038923
Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon <UNK> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 2.0092330025650473
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . 1.5706464294715548
Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . 2.154434690031884
" Oh ! 2154.4346900318833
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . 2.154434690031884
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 5.179474679231212
" What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut . 3.1622776601683795
The pause was to Elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . 10.000000000000002
" How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! 2.346228848142263
At length , she spoke again . 26.82695795279726
I think I have heard you say that you know them . " " I know them a little . 3.1622776601683795
" Not yet , " replied Jane . 17.78279410038923
They have some of the finest woods in the country . " Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <UNK> . 2.7213387683753076
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a <UNK> kind of a little <UNK> on one side of your lawn . 1.4585940117250362
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of <UNK> , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than <UNK> anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 1.5441135899948315
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy ! 5.878016072274914
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 1.8329807108324359
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 4.641588833612778
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 12.915496650148839
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 2.346228848142263
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . 2.0535250264571463
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham . 12.915496650148839
" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s <UNK> in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . 1.5085907086001784
But now it was all too natural . 17.78279410038923
CHAPTER XVI . 2154.4346900318833
My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . 1.5085907086001784
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of <UNK> from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a <UNK> horse . 2.1017480113324885
They were ignorant , idle , and vain . 12.915496650148839
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 1.6496480740980204
A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it <UNK> from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . 2.610157215682537
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . 1.8047217668271702
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . 1.4773776525985112
<UNK> check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and addresses . 5.179474679231212
I must beg to return to the house . " And she rose as she spoke . 3.8746751204561316
" This will not do , " said Elizabeth . 10.000000000000002
I did for you . 100.00000000000004
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr . Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . 1.4174741629268053
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being <UNK> dressed . 5.179474679231212
At such a distance as that , you know , things are <UNK> misrepresented . " " Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips . 2.346228848142263
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 2.4244620170823286
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley ' s behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . 1.3593563908785256
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be <UNK> at , and it was rather too early to begin . 2.8480358684358014
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . 1.8957356524063758
If the <UNK> of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . 2.0535250264571463
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self importance and humility . 1.3485595530525598
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
yes I understand you perfectly . " " I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . " " That is as it happens . 1.8047217668271702
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B . 8.11130830789687
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 4.641588833612778
How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr . Bingley ? " " Not at all . " " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . 2.0092330025650473
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 2.2122162910704493
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . " " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . 1.1747083882399671
" Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy . 4.216965034285822
I guessed as much . " And though he exclaimed at the <UNK> , she found that it had been pretty much the case . 2.51188643150958
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ? 2.4244620170823286
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . 1.615598098439874
CHAPTER II . 2154.4346900318833
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? " A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and <UNK> and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . 1.333521432163324
The letter was to this effect " MY DEAR <UNK> , " I wish you joy . 3.8746751204561316
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy . 2.1017480113324885
For your sake , " turning to Charlotte , " I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for <UNK> estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh ' s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? " " A little . " " Oh ! 1.4497406703726319
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . " The wedding took place ; the bride and <UNK> set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . 1.557068404753731
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 10.000000000000002
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . 8.11130830789687
" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 2.2758459260747883
Oh , sister ! 316.22776601683796
I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . 3.359818286283782
oh ! 100000.00000000001
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted <UNK> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <UNK> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . 1.93069772888325
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . 2.154434690031884
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . 2.2122162910704493
In spite of her deeply <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger . 1.425102670302998
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good <UNK> engaged Mr . Collins ' s conversation to herself . 2.2122162910704493
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! 3.1622776601683795
Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . 1.778279410038923
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 2.2758459260747883
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it . 1.8957356524063758
She <UNK> from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . 1.6876124757881477
Collins so before you came . 46.415888336127786
But there are two things that I want very much to know one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . " " <UNK> ! 1.6681005372000588
Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . 1.6496480740980204
They <UNK> every attempt of Mrs . 26.82695795279726
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , <UNK> every chance of <UNK> himself by marrying well ? 1.8632463119315603
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . 2.8480358684358014
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? 8.11130830789687
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees . 2.0092330025650473
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what <UNK> his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 1.3894954943731377
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her . 6.812920690579612
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention . 5.878016072274914
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . 1.8329807108324359
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
<UNK> any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . " " Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . 1.2618568830660204
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . " " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger . 1.4412195967188537
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . 6.812920690579612
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest <UNK> ; his <UNK> contracted , his air gloomy . 2.346228848142263
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <UNK> the excellent understanding , and <UNK> excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 1.2915496650148839
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 2.8480358684358014
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . 2.4244620170823286
He cannot afford it . 100.00000000000004
She could think only of her letter . 17.78279410038923
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . 5.878016072274914
Oh , brother , how kind you are ! 12.915496650148839
Bennet was restored to her usual <UNK> serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the <UNK> office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton . 1.3111339374215643
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 4.641588833612778
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 1.3593563908785256
When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . 1.8957356524063758
Let me do it without farther loss of time . 10.000000000000002
The visit was returned in due form . 17.78279410038923
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " <UNK> in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . 1.53174046370208
Long . 100000.00000000001
Could he , or the Lucases , have <UNK> on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the <UNK> more effectually to what they related ? 1.9684194472866121
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! 1.8329807108324359
Such a countenance , such manners ! 26.82695795279726
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very <UNK> to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . 2.51188643150958
her liveliness had been never worse <UNK> . 17.78279410038923
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . 1.7301957388458942
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 1.9684194472866121
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . 10.000000000000002
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was <UNK> her feelings in <UNK> on Elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . 1.6681005372000588
Every kind of pride must <UNK> from the connection . 10.000000000000002
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most <UNK> in inviting Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 1.2648552168552962
" A <UNK> ! " she cried . 17.78279410038923
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Are the <UNK> of Pemberley to be thus <UNK> ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . 2.4244620170823286
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her . 10.000000000000002
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . 1.8047217668271702
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 1.8329807108324359
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . " " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the <UNK> manner which I see so many women ' s do . 1.5706464294715548
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . 2.9935772947204895
" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . 4.641588833612778
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . 2.154434690031884
But vanity , not love , has been my folly . <UNK> with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . 1.557068404753731
It was first broken by Mrs . 26.82695795279726
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 2.0535250264571463
Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the <UNK> and smiles of the whole party . 1.778279410038923
" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . 2.154434690031884
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one <UNK> idea of any thing . 2.4244620170823286
" <UNK> . 2154.4346900318833
And when you have given your ball , " she added , " I shall insist on their giving one also . 2.8480358684358014
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . 2.610157215682537
" And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . 2.9935772947204895
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . 2.8480358684358014
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of <UNK> whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to <UNK> , she began to regret that he came . 1.4677992676220695
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . " " Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . " " And do you like her ? " " Very much . " " I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . 1.53174046370208
Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . 4.641588833612778
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . 1.8957356524063758
Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father . 1.7082763938087104
" What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? " " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . " " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . 1.4585940117250362
Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . 2.346228848142263
Thank Heaven ! 2154.4346900318833
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . 1.8047217668271702
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 1.6681005372000588
As she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs . 8.11130830789687
" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . " He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very <UNK> thing , and called out to her , " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr . Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain . 1.1038713326488419
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . 10.000000000000002
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 1.778279410038923
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! <UNK> our surprise . 1.5998587196060583
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . 1.5848931924611136

The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . 1.5998587196060583
I am sure you will be very comfortable there . 10.000000000000002
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ' s . 3.8746751204561316
He comes down on Thursday at the <UNK> , very likely on Wednesday . 5.179474679231212
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . 2.51188643150958
She saw with the <UNK> eye of fancy , the <UNK> of that gay bathing place covered with officers . 3.1622776601683795
Her hair so <UNK> , so <UNK> ! " " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six <UNK> deep in <UNK> , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . " " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . 1.3593563908785256
Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously . " Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will <UNK> excite . 1.778279410038923
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw <UNK> in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . 1.4330125702369627
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . " " I would wish not to be hasty in <UNK> any one ; but I always speak what I think . " " I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder . 1.557068404753731
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 1.9684194472866121
Bennet . 100000.00000000001
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 1.93069772888325
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister . 2.2758459260747883
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . 5.179474679231212
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
I am not <UNK> you know . 26.82695795279726
You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and <UNK> all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg tm works . 1.8632463119315603
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . 2.1017480113324885
It seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary <UNK> , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . 1.6496480740980204
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . 5.179474679231212
Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the <UNK> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . 1.557068404753731
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . 1.8957356524063758
" I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel <UNK> ' s regiment went away . 2.51188643150958
Bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . 1.9684194472866121
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <UNK> , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the <UNK> way for happiness . 1.3708385261355818
She is not such a simpleton . 26.82695795279726
<UNK> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 2.4244620170823286
<UNK> is impossible ; <UNK> , <UNK> . 17.78279410038923
All was joy and kindness . 46.415888336127786
They came . 2154.4346900318833
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being <UNK> by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . 1.425102670302998
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <UNK> . 5.179474679231212
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must <UNK> him from such <UNK> misconduct as I have suffered by . 1.8957356524063758
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very <UNK> <UNK> for Netherfield were got by <UNK> . 2.610157215682537
His letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in <UNK> business , he was quick in its execution . 3.1622776601683795
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . " While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much <UNK> to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s . 1.2505106035854068
The <UNK> and yet the noise ; the <UNK> and yet the self importance of all these people ! What would I give to hear your <UNK> on them ! " " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . 1.7301957388458942
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had <UNK> to his amusement . 2.8480358684358014
You know I have . 100.00000000000004
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " " Oh ! 3.359818286283782
He had to be sure done much . 17.78279410038923
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! 4.641588833612778
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . 1.4412195967188537
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . 3.8746751204561316
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 1.4977474763452014
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . 2.1017480113324885
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . 6.812920690579612
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? 3.359818286283782
" When my eyes were opened to his real character . Oh ! 5.878016072274914
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such <UNK> as these . 2.9935772947204895
Every thing <UNK> what is strong already . 17.78279410038923
But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . " " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . " Elizabeth made no answer . 1.3708385261355818
With <UNK> tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of <UNK> that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . 1.8329807108324359
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected . 8.11130830789687
" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! 3.8746751204561316
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 2.346228848142263
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . 2.0092330025650473
Annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs . 1.8329807108324359
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . " " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request . 2.2122162910704493
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 1.2809343786525484
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 2.2758459260747883
It is highly improper . 100.00000000000004
Nothing could be more delightful ! 46.415888336127786
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 5.179474679231212
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . 2.4244620170823286
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . 3.8746751204561316
But with me , it is not so . 12.915496650148839
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 1.5706464294715548
What will become of me . 46.415888336127786
In the former were many good <UNK> ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some <UNK> of Miss Darcy ' s , in <UNK> , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . 1.5085907086001784
" <UNK> he will not leave London before he has found them . 5.878016072274914
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 1.1987818459583777
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ' s two sisters . 1.7301957388458942
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . " " You observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . " " Certainly not . " " To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! 1.3111339374215643
and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! 17.78279410038923
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . 2.7213387683753076
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . 12.915496650148839
Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . 1.4873521072935114
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . 1.7301957388458942
Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . " CHAPTER XIII . 2.9935772947204895
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . 2.346228848142263
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to <UNK> as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was . 1.7301957388458942
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . 4.216965034285822
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . <UNK> are never of so much consequence to a father . 2.610157215682537
<UNK> recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 1.93069772888325
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . 2.7213387683753076
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to <UNK> ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . 2.154434690031884
This is my advice . 100.00000000000004
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . 2.8480358684358014
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> . 2.7213387683753076
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . " " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth <UNK> ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy ' s steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself . " " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a <UNK> . 1.2401035305418566
His plan did not vary on seeing them . Miss Bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his <UNK> notions of what was due to <UNK> ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice . 1.7082763938087104
Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 1.7534865500829584
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <UNK> <UNK> on the probability of each statement but with little success . 2.2758459260747883
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 1.778279410038923
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side . 6.812920690579612
Miss Darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . 8.11130830789687
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our <UNK> ! 1.4030037231905736
" Oh ! 2154.4346900318833
But if I go on , I shall <UNK> you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . 3.1622776601683795
" You write uncommonly fast . " " You are mistaken . 6.812920690579612
My feelings in every respect forbid it . 17.78279410038923
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go . 10.000000000000002
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . 1.6496480740980204
Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " Lord , how tired I am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn . 1.93069772888325
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr . Darcy ' s steward . 1.28792362543363
These are <UNK> , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . 2.2122162910704493
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 1.8957356524063758
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uncle Philips , <UNK> <UNK> wine , who followed them into the room . 1.3894954943731377
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 2.7213387683753076
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . 1.93069772888325
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a <UNK> , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , <UNK> to Kitty and Lydia . 1.53174046370208
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 1.3111339374215643
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . 1.2451970847350329
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever <UNK> , and the <UNK> friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . 1.53174046370208
After <UNK> their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ? 2.1017480113324885
Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . 3.593813663804627
CHAPTER III . 2154.4346900318833
<UNK> had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and <UNK> her disgust of Mr . Collins . 3.359818286283782
Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . " " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget . 1.4412195967188537
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 1.2710617996147449
" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! " said she . 5.878016072274914
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . " " Very true ; and if I had my will , we should . 2.2122162910704493
How much sooner one <UNK> of any thing than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . " No one made any reply . 1.7534865500829584
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage . 2.8480358684358014
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , <UNK> from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and <UNK> by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 1.3708385261355818
Lizzy <UNK> she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . " " And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems an hopeless business . " " <UNK> to Lizzy about it yourself . 1.5706464294715548
" I am all astonishment . 46.415888336127786
can it be really so ! 46.415888336127786
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . 1.365007806546014
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged <UNK> of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . 1.632172128563275
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . 2.4244620170823286
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night . 3.1622776601683795
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . 2.0535250264571463
<UNK> Kitty ! 2154.4346900318833
Every body declared that he was the <UNK> young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always <UNK> the appearance of his goodness . 2.0092330025650473
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . 26.82695795279726
<UNK> of business too ! 100.00000000000004
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was <UNK> her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs . 1.425102670302998
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . 5.878016072274914
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . 2.9935772947204895
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <UNK> of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James ' s , with very decent composure . 1.6876124757881477
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it . 4.216965034285822
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <UNK> infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . 1.8329807108324359
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 2.346228848142263
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . 3.8746751204561316
" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living . 3.359818286283782
Hurst ' s gown " Here she was interrupted again . 8.11130830789687
" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not <UNK> declare that Caroline neither <UNK> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <UNK> the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly ! to put me on my guard ? 1.4585940117250362
And then when we came away it was such fun ! 8.11130830789687
" I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr . Darcy ! " " It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . " " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . " " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . " " <UNK> ! 1.2618568830660204
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 1.7534865500829584
Her <UNK> wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . 5.878016072274914
From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an <UNK> chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . 1.632172128563275
Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 2.4244620170823286
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . 1.6496480740980204
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 2.51188643150958
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . 6.812920690579612
Allowing for the common <UNK> of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy . 1.5199110829529336

Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long . 4.641588833612778
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 2.154434690031884
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most <UNK> character ! 2.8480358684358014
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 3.359818286283782
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings . 2.0535250264571463
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . " " I see no occasion for that . 1.8632463119315603
" How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet ! 5.179474679231212
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <UNK> <UNK> . 2.1017480113324885
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . 1.778279410038923
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . 1.9684194472866121
If you ' <UNK> believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 2.51188643150958
They soon <UNK> the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . 3.359818286283782
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia ' s marriage . 3.593813663804627
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? 6.812920690579612
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . 3.8746751204561316
CHAPTER XIV . 2154.4346900318833
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy . 4.216965034285822
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 1.6876124757881477
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 2.346228848142263
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . 4.641588833612778
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . 2.8480358684358014
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " Oh ! " cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted . 1.8957356524063758
She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . 2.2758459260747883
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . " " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . 2.2122162910704493
Are you going much farther ? " " No , I should have turned in a moment . " And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together . 2.0092330025650473
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to <UNK> this estate after the death of your honoured father , who , however , may live many years longer , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . 1.3111339374215643
CHAPTER <UNK> . 2154.4346900318833
Elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several <UNK> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . 1.3768571648527583
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . 3.1622776601683795
If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 2.8480358684358014
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 1.4873521072935114
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . " " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . 1.4030037231905736
But I knew I should persuade you at last . 10.000000000000002
" ' Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much . 4.216965034285822
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . " " I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want . " " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " No , indeed . 1.4873521072935114
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 3.359818286283782
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . " " <UNK> ! " cried Bingley . 3.593813663804627
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> . 1.6496480740980204
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 3.8746751204561316
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon <UNK> up every private care ; and covering her face with her <UNK> , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . 1.2238249369681928
She then <UNK> again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . " " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . " " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something <UNK> <UNK> in the usual <UNK> of such a meeting . 1.1226677735108135
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the <UNK> old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . 1.4585940117250362
CHAPTER I . 2154.4346900318833
His doing so drew her notice . 26.82695795279726
I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . 3.593813663804627
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world . 2.8480358684358014
It <UNK> because of the efforts of <UNK> of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life . 3.1622776601683795
I remain , dear sir , with <UNK> compliments to your lady and daughters , your well <UNK> and friend , <UNK> <UNK> . " " At four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he <UNK> up the letter . 1.5199110829529336
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 3.1622776601683795
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <UNK> <UNK> necessary . 1.93069772888325
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <UNK> of my son in law . 1.93069772888325
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . 2.8480358684358014
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . 1.4585940117250362
To the civil enquiries which then <UNK> in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer . 1.8329807108324359
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . 2.346228848142263
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 100.00000000000004
" They are going to be <UNK> near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! 2.51188643150958
They <UNK> as expeditiously as possible ; and <UNK> one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day . 2.610157215682537
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 3.359818286283782
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few <UNK> , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <UNK> . " Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 1.3485595530525598
Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 3.359818286283782
One must speak a little , you know . 12.915496650148839
" John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? " " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 1.8632463119315603
are quite well . " " But you How are you ? " cried Elizabeth . 4.216965034285822
I shall be back by dinner . " " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . 1.324192791886045
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private <UNK> in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of <UNK> with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . 1.4412195967188537
She saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . 1.6496480740980204
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 5.179474679231212
" Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 1.396135390856794
" Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . 1.353876180022544
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . 2.0535250264571463
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an <UNK> on every subject . 5.179474679231212
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <UNK> of elegant nuptials , fine <UNK> , new carriages , and servants . 1.5441135899948315
We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 2.9935772947204895
Her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . 2.154434690031884
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 1.8047217668271702
Sir William had been delighted with him . 17.78279410038923
It is a pity they are not handsome ! 12.915496650148839
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in <UNK> ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs . 1.5085907086001784
and Mrs . 2154.4346900318833
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot . 26.82695795279726
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her <UNK> , by dwelling on them . 3.359818286283782
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is <UNK> the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken <UNK> , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . 1.2809343786525484
And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined . 1.7534865500829584
As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner ' s hope of Lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its <UNK> . 1.9684194472866121
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . " Mrs . 2.2758459260747883
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . 2.2758459260747883
<UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . " " We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . " " But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs . 1.319720393061375
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . 8.11130830789687
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . 1.8957356524063758

" Upon my word , " said Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . 5.878016072274914
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . 3.1622776601683795
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on . 1.8047217668271702
Good Heaven ! 2154.4346900318833
Jenkinson , who lives with them . 26.82695795279726
It was a rational scheme to be sure ! 12.915496650148839
But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . 4.216965034285822
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 1.6681005372000588
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <UNK> on such a research ; in which <UNK> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally <UNK> , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . 1.324192791886045
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so <UNK> ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . 1.2809343786525484
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 2.346228848142263
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . 5.878016072274914
. 10000000000.000004
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . 1.7301957388458942
my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 3.359818286283782
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . " " But not before they went to Brighton ? " " No , I believe not . " " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? 1.5706464294715548
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . 10.000000000000002
Of this she was perfectly <UNK> ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . 2.0092330025650473
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 3.8746751204561316
She had high <UNK> spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . 1.7301957388458942
They will never be distressed for money . 17.78279410038923
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . " Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . 1.4773776525985112
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? 1.8329807108324359
And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 1.365007806546014
<UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her . 1.5998587196060583
<UNK> as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . 1.4873521072935114
You shall hear what she says . " She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . Hurst had a house . 1.5441135899948315
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 2.0092330025650473
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . 6.812920690579612
It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . 2.154434690031884
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! 12.915496650148839
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . 17.78279410038923
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 1.5706464294715548
Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <UNK> and <UNK> father ; and though he belonged to one of the <UNK> , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 1.396135390856794
<UNK> of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where . 5.878016072274914
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . 5.878016072274914
I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . " " You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr . Darcy . " " No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ' s connections . 1.3593563908785256
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 2.610157215682537
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . 1.632172128563275
But do not imagine that he is always here so often . 6.812920690579612
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 2.9935772947204895
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . 1.2532543355087804
" Your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . 6.812920690579612
In a few minutes , Mrs . 26.82695795279726
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 3.593813663804627
He has children of his own , and may have more . 6.812920690579612
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . 1.295267744355328
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . 4.216965034285822
Gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . 1.8957356524063758
Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . 2.0535250264571463
Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? 3.1622776601683795
My mind was more agreeably engaged . 26.82695795279726
This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham . 1.6496480740980204
But when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ' s <UNK> all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 1.5848931924611136
I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . " Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . 1.4330125702369627
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1.778279410038923
Why does she not come in ? " " Oh ! 8.11130830789687
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . 2.7213387683753076
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . 3.8746751204561316
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners <UNK> respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 1.5848931924611136
I expected you to stay two months . 17.78279410038923
My sisters may write to me . 26.82695795279726
But I will no longer <UNK> my young cousin . " Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his <UNK> at backgammon . 2.346228848142263
there is not a bit of fish to be got to day . 5.878016072274914
And what sort of young lady is she ? 12.915496650148839
Will you come and see me ? " " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . " " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . 2.0092330025650473
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . 4.216965034285822
Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . 4.216965034285822
I am perfectly satisfied . 100.00000000000004
But still he would be her husband . Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . 1.5199110829529336
The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in <UNK> and <UNK> , and the evening at one of the <UNK> . 2.7213387683753076
CHAPTER III . 2154.4346900318833
Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 2.4244620170823286
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever . 2.0535250264571463
It was not all settled before Monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . 2.9935772947204895
She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . 1.5441135899948315
Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . 3.359818286283782
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " There can be no doubt of that . 2.51188643150958
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . " And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr . Collins thus addressed her , " When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from <UNK> you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . " " <UNK> , Mr . Collins , " cried Elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly . 1.16957266874034
She certainly did not hate him . 26.82695795279726
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . 2.7213387683753076
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . 8.11130830789687
Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in <UNK> , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and <UNK> a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire . 1.2560585988318853
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . " " If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . 1.4677992676220695
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . 4.216965034285822
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 3.359818286283782
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 1.778279410038923
I wish I could see her . 26.82695795279726
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? " Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . 1.8957356524063758
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 1.2648552168552962
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . 5.878016072274914
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . " " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? " " Dearest Jane ! 1.632172128563275
Mr . Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . 2.8480358684358014
Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . 2.2758459260747883
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 2.0535250264571463
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . 8.11130830789687
What a good joke it will be ! 17.78279410038923
Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! 2.1017480113324885
So high and so conceited that there was no <UNK> him ! 6.812920690579612
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . 1.6876124757881477
How much you must have gone through ! " Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs . 1.8632463119315603
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her <UNK> you . " Mrs . 1.5998587196060583
I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . 2.154434690031884
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to <UNK> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . 1.778279410038923
But , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . 2.8480358684358014
But the case is this . 46.415888336127786
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . 2.0092330025650473
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 1.7082763938087104
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <UNK> , but Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 3.359818286283782
" You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried . 6.812920690579612
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 4.641588833612778
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . 1.5706464294715548

One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! 2.8480358684358014
Our poor mother is sadly grieved . 26.82695795279726
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 5.179474679231212
Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . 6.812920690579612
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 3.593813663804627
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to <UNK> his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be <UNK> <UNK> . 1.353876180022544
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 3.593813663804627
Your <UNK> makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a <UNK> . " " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! 1.7534865500829584
Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . 1.8957356524063758
<UNK> , teazing , man ! 46.415888336127786
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 1.4412195967188537
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . 2.9935772947204895
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? 5.878016072274914
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? 2.610157215682537
I shall like it of all things . 17.78279410038923
" But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . " " <UNK> , headstrong girl ! 1.7301957388458942
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! 3.359818286283782
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 3.1622776601683795
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 3.8746751204561316
Mr . Darcy <UNK> it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . 1.4677992676220695
After a slight <UNK> for good news , the letter was read aloud . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 4.216965034285822
Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better . 12.915496650148839
Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and <UNK> its extent . 5.878016072274914
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 1.778279410038923
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . 2.346228848142263
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much <UNK> ; but when Mrs . 1.3593563908785256
And then we were so merry all the way home ! 8.11130830789687
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . " " That is his notion of christian forgiveness ! 1.778279410038923
CHAPTER II . 2154.4346900318833
I am very glad you liked her . 17.78279410038923
But pride where there is a real <UNK> of mind , pride will be always under good <UNK> . " Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . 2.2758459260747883
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? 8.11130830789687
It cannot be concealed from any one . 17.78279410038923

You see how continually we are engaged there . 12.915496650148839
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> . 1.8957356524063758
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . 5.179474679231212
They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . 5.179474679231212
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to <UNK> her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever <UNK> . 1.5085907086001784
Two <UNK> , however , were plainly <UNK> from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been <UNK> used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 1.5199110829529336
Mr . Wickham ' s chief object was <UNK> my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of <UNK> himself on me , was a strong inducement . 1.778279410038923
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . " Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire . 1.2478254704700218
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . 2.51188643150958
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell . 4.641588833612778
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 2.51188643150958
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been <UNK> , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . 1.778279410038923
It was really a very handsome thought . 17.78279410038923
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . 2.610157215682537
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . 1.6681005372000588
All Meryton seemed striving to <UNK> the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . 2.610157215682537
He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? 2.4244620170823286
I will think no more about him . " Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth . 1.6681005372000588
On this subject , what can you have to say ? 8.11130830789687
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? " " Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . 2.154434690031884
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . 2.4244620170823286

" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself . 2.8480358684358014
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . 5.878016072274914
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word . 4.641588833612778
He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . " " Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . " He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . 1.1406249238513209
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . " " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose . 2.51188643150958
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! 4.641588833612778
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a <UNK> library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read <UNK> . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose <UNK> ' s <UNK> . 1.396135390856794
There can be no occasion for your going so soon . 8.11130830789687
She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband . 10.000000000000002
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . " CHAPTER VII . 2.2122162910704493
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 3.593813663804627
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . 1.9684194472866121
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . " " This is not to be borne . 2.8480358684358014
It is what every body says . 26.82695795279726
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger <UNK> than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance <UNK> and <UNK> . 2.0092330025650473
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . 1.6876124757881477
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time . 1.8957356524063758

Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly <UNK> , she seated herself . 1.8957356524063758

And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can <UNK> a woman . " " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? 1.4677992676220695
It was at Sir William Lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . 4.216965034285822
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . 1.4585940117250362
" My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . " But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . 1.295267744355328
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . 1.632172128563275
Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual <UNK> ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the <UNK> of his thoughts . 1.4412195967188537
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good <UNK> will <UNK> it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth <UNK> lest her mother should be exposing herself again . 1.5998587196060583
" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs . 4.641588833612778
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth ! 2.346228848142263

Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . 4.216965034285822
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . 8.11130830789687
The housekeeper came ; a respectable looking , <UNK> woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . 2.2758459260747883
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the <UNK> of the first . 1.6876124757881477
" Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . 4.216965034285822

" I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . " " Who do you mean , my dear ? 1.4773776525985112
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . 2.610157215682537
That tall , proud man . " " Good gracious ! 8.11130830789687
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 1.425102670302998
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 4.216965034285822
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 3.359818286283782
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . 6.812920690579612
<UNK> as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . 2.346228848142263
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <UNK> . 1.632172128563275
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 1.5848931924611136

Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her . 2.610157215682537
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . 5.878016072274914

It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling . " " Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose . 2.2758459260747883
She could not <UNK> him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . 2.8480358684358014
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . 3.593813663804627

A most delightful place ! <UNK> Parsonage House ! 12.915496650148839
Whatever bears affinity to <UNK> is <UNK> . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 2.51188643150958
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . " It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . 1.632172128563275
<UNK> Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary .

how unlucky ! 2154.4346900318833
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . " " Not as you represent it . 3.1622776601683795
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 5.878016072274914

I ought not to have said a word about it . 8.11130830789687
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged . 2.0535250264571463
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . " " And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the <UNK> of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! 1.2990813969063477

I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? 1.8329807108324359
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the <UNK> . " This was not very consoling to Mrs . 3.1622776601683795
that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! 5.179474679231212
Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . 1.9684194472866121
Nobody wants him to come . 46.415888336127786

The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr . Bingley ? " " When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . 1.5848931924611136
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 1.8329807108324359

The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? 2.1017480113324885
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of <UNK> them . 1.778279410038923
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . " " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . 1.5706464294715548
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " CHAPTER XVIII . 3.593813663804627

Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . 8.11130830789687
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . " CHAPTER IV . 1.8047217668271702
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . 1.778279410038923
The express was sent off directly . 26.82695795279726
where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without <UNK> a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . 1.4977474763452014
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 1.2505106035854068
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ? 1.2990813969063477
By Mrs . 2154.4346900318833
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <UNK> , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 2.2758459260747883
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . 2.2122162910704493
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 3.1622776601683795
GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 2.0535250264571463
Well , much good may it do them ! 12.915496650148839
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . 2.0535250264571463
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 10.000000000000002
Other schemes too came into her head . 17.78279410038923
I thought I should have broke my heart . " " I am sure I shall break mine , " said Lydia . 2.7213387683753076
He has the promise of an <UNK> in General ' s regiment , now quartered in the North . 3.359818286283782

Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 2.2122162910704493
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr . Wickham . 3.593813663804627
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . 12.915496650148839
Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the <UNK> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . 1.4030037231905736
Their table was <UNK> stupid . 46.415888336127786
My aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . " " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . 1.6496480740980204
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
It was gratitude . <UNK> , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <UNK> and <UNK> of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 1.6681005372000588
Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 1.4330125702369627
Ten thousand a year ! 100.00000000000004
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 1.4873521072935114
" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . 2.346228848142263
" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party . 2.154434690031884
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 1.4677992676220695
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and <UNK> to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head . 2.0535250264571463
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 2.610157215682537
How well it <UNK> . 100.00000000000004
I shall <UNK> it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . " And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh ! 1.6876124757881477
Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> . 4.216965034285822
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? 6.812920690579612
I saw them the night before last . " Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . 1.9684194472866121
With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . 1.93069772888325
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most . 3.8746751204561316
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 2.2758459260747883
<UNK> , stay , I will go myself . 12.915496650148839
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! 1.5706464294715548
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . 1.615598098439874
They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . 2.51188643150958
CHAPTER XIV . 2154.4346900318833
" While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . 2.1017480113324885
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . " " But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . " " Let me be rightly understood . 1.5199110829529336
what does he say ? 100.00000000000004
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had <UNK> <UNK> only four months ago , would now have been <UNK> and gratefully received ! 1.8957356524063758
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances and to have Mr . Collins instead ! 3.1622776601683795
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . " <UNK> ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 2.0535250264571463
She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . 2.154434690031884
We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . 1.5085907086001784
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the <UNK> of my father ' s will , has been <UNK> acquainted with every particular of these transactions . 1.5085907086001784
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . 8.11130830789687
CHAPTER XVII . 2154.4346900318833
She is well , and <UNK> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . Your ' s , c . 2.8480358684358014
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and <UNK> the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 1.2843862635897427
GARDINER . " " Is it possible ! " cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . 3.8746751204561316
Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . 4.216965034285822
Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s sufferings . 2.2122162910704493
Not all that Mrs . 100.00000000000004
Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . 4.641588833612778
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . 1.5199110829529336
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an <UNK> of Mr . Darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . 1.8329807108324359
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 1.93069772888325
A house in town ! 100.00000000000004
In ran Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 2.346228848142263
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . 8.11130830789687
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 1.1683354854432926
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . 2.9935772947204895
" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . 2.9935772947204895
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 5.878016072274914
At that moment , she cared for no other . 10.000000000000002
YOU AGREE THAT YOU <UNK> NO <UNK> FOR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . F . . YOU AGREE THAT THE <UNK> , THE <UNK> <UNK> , AND ANY <UNK> <UNK> THIS <UNK> <UNK> NOT <UNK> <UNK> TO YOU FOR <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> DAMAGES <UNK> <UNK> YOU <UNK> <UNK> OF THE <UNK> OF <UNK> <UNK> . 1.353876180022544
I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 1.8957356524063758
and his sisters are charming women . 26.82695795279726
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate . 1.7534865500829584
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 1.4412195967188537
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
I wonder what he can be doing there . " " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth . 2.51188643150958
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them . 5.878016072274914
Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " This walk is not wide enough for our party . 2.9935772947204895
<UNK> in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . 10.000000000000002
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . 1.7082763938087104
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , <UNK> had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 1.5199110829529336
What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . 2.7213387683753076
I have not been accustomed to such language as this . 8.11130830789687
F . 100000.00000000001
He had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . 2.0535250264571463
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . 1.3433993325989002
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the <UNK> , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 1.5085907086001784
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 1.8632463119315603
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . 3.359818286283782
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . 1.93069772888325
It was all pride and <UNK> . 26.82695795279726
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . 10.000000000000002
Oh , Lord ! 316.22776601683796
During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <UNK> , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . 1.53174046370208
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . 2.8480358684358014
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the <UNK> kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . 1.9684194472866121
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . 2.154434690031884
How was that possible ? 100.00000000000004
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation . 1.4585940117250362
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . 2.7213387683753076
<UNK> and pride are different things , though the words are often used <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
He does not want abilities . 46.415888336127786
why did she come ? 100.00000000000004
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 1.333521432163324
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . 2.4244620170823286
Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with <UNK> civility that they were perfectly needless . 2.7213387683753076
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room . 3.359818286283782
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . " Her father lifted up his eyes . 2.9935772947204895
" Oh ! 2154.4346900318833
" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the <UNK> <UNK> above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <UNK> than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . 1.2260144114527525
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . 1.3593563908785256
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . 1.7301957388458942
The possibility of Mr . Collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins ! 1.333521432163324
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 1.5848931924611136

Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ' s beauty . 4.216965034285822
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach . 1.8632463119315603
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 4.641588833612778
Mr . Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . 3.8746751204561316
But Georgiana would not join her . 26.82695795279726
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 2.51188643150958
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 4.641588833612778
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 5.878016072274914
She <UNK> Miss <UNK> a treasure . 26.82695795279726
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 1.3708385261355818
Mr . and Mrs . 100.00000000000004
Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 2.346228848142263
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as <UNK> <UNK> as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . 1.632172128563275
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <UNK> , readily obeyed . 2.9935772947204895
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <UNK> ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . 1.53174046370208
" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance . 2.154434690031884
I promised them so <UNK> ! 46.415888336127786
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 3.359818286283782
" Of music ! 316.22776601683796
She continued in very <UNK> reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 1.8632463119315603
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia . 2.1017480113324885
Lord ! 100000.00000000001
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . " Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . 1.2352165993694857
Your <UNK> are by no means unlike . 17.78279410038923
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a <UNK> table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the <UNK> of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . 1.4330125702369627
" I see what you are feeling , " replied Charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to marry you . 1.9684194472866121
I dare say the <UNK> upon Mrs . 17.78279410038923
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . 1.5848931924611136
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever . " Darcy was fixed in astonishment . 2.346228848142263
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 1.5998587196060583
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . 1.7534865500829584
CHAPTER XI . 2154.4346900318833
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . 1.5998587196060583
It will pass away soon enough . " " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty . 1.632172128563275
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 5.878016072274914
If you are outside the United States , check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before <UNK> , copying , displaying , performing , distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg tm work . 1.615598098439874
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . 5.878016072274914
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the <UNK> of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . 1.425102670302998
In pompous <UNK> on his side , and civil <UNK> on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton . 2.610157215682537
When this was done , she had a less active part to play . 5.179474679231212
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . " Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative . 1.5706464294715548
Jane was not happy . 100.00000000000004
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! 8.11130830789687
Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . 2.154434690031884
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of <UNK> on Mr . Collins ' s side , and as many bows on Sir William ' s , they departed . 1.778279410038923
You have done all this ! 46.415888336127786
I am going away myself . " " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . " And upon Elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr . Collins . " Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . 1.2154742500762865
I always had a value for him . 17.78279410038923
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . 6.812920690579612
I want to talk very seriously . 26.82695795279726
" Well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? 2.2122162910704493
Mary <UNK> for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . 2.610157215682537
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 2.9935772947204895
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . 5.878016072274914
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 8.11130830789687
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! 4.216965034285822
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more <UNK> purpose . 3.593813663804627
After walking several miles in a <UNK> manner , and too <UNK> to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their <UNK> , that it was time to be at home . 1.8329807108324359
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . " Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less <UNK> of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too <UNK> by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . 1.28792362543363
It was unpardonable . 316.22776601683796
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . 4.641588833612778
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . 3.1622776601683795
I cannot quite agree with you there . 17.78279410038923
. C . The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation " the Foundation " or <UNK> , owns a <UNK> copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works . 2.154434690031884
A few weeks , he believed . 26.82695795279726
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole <UNK> of <UNK> , as was here collected in one individual . 2.154434690031884
She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . 1.8047217668271702
The path just admitted three . 46.415888336127786
They are destined for each other by the voice of every <UNK> of their <UNK> houses ; and what is to divide them ? 2.610157215682537
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
But my dear Lydia , I don ' t at all like your going such a way off . 3.359818286283782
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 2.0092330025650473
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . 6.812920690579612
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . 5.878016072274914
When they were all in the drawing room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . 1.8632463119315603
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . 2.154434690031884
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <UNK> circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her <UNK> and steady candour always <UNK> for <UNK> , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 1.4977474763452014
" If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . 1.6876124757881477
They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . 1.6496480740980204
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 2.4244620170823286
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ' s folly . " " Indeed you are mistaken . 2.2122162910704493
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . 8.11130830789687
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long <UNK> . " Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
I will put on my things in a moment . 10.000000000000002
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of <UNK> was delightful to her , and she began her song . 1.6681005372000588
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . 1.5706464294715548
Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . " Then addressing her daughter , " Oh ! 2.51188643150958
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 3.593813663804627
But don ' t imagine it was from any silly cause . 6.812920690579612
are sufficiently known . 316.22776601683796
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 1.8047217668271702
At length Darcy spoke , and in a <UNK> manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . " " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with <UNK> , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . " Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . 1.28792362543363
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished . 3.8746751204561316
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . 2.0535250264571463
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the <UNK> road . 1.6496480740980204
But you are always giving her the preference . " " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . " " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? 1.425102670302998
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater <UNK> concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being <UNK> by <UNK> , <UNK> inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . 1.7082763938087104
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in <UNK> , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . 1.3111339374215643
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 1.365007806546014
They will ruin your happiness . 46.415888336127786
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . 1.4585940117250362
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to <UNK> such pleasures . 1.7082763938087104
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . 1.778279410038923
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 2.0535250264571463
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . 3.8746751204561316
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . 3.8746751204561316
Elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . 2.7213387683753076
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . 1.4977474763452014
" I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ' s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . 1.8632463119315603
<UNK> donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any <UNK> concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States . 2.610157215682537
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 100.00000000000004
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage . 1.778279410038923
" What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? 3.359818286283782
He seldom appeared really animated . 46.415888336127786
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . 1.778279410038923
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . 3.593813663804627
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . 4.216965034285822
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child . 17.78279410038923
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . " " Oh ! " said Lydia <UNK> , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , I ' <UNK> the <UNK> . " The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . 1.3070104796093682
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 2.7213387683753076
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . 4.641588833612778
<UNK> that may be , you are <UNK> to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . " Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . 2.4244620170823286
CHAPTER V . 2154.4346900318833
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . 4.216965034285822
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . 2.51188643150958
<UNK> pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . 2.8480358684358014
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <UNK> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . 1.2742749857031337
<UNK> may sometimes be purchased too dearly . 17.78279410038923
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <UNK> , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . 1.4412195967188537
Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? " " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . 1.8632463119315603
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . 4.216965034285822
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the <UNK> of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 1.5199110829529336
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 2.2122162910704493
Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . 12.915496650148839
" I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she . 4.216965034285822
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her <UNK> intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . 1.4977474763452014
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 8.11130830789687
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . 5.179474679231212
" Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated . 5.179474679231212
You have employed your time much better . 17.78279410038923
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . 8.11130830789687
They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy . 1.5199110829529336
" Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever <UNK> , that your resentment once created was <UNK> . 1.4677992676220695
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn house . 6.812920690579612
Gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the <UNK> fashions . 3.359818286283782
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell <UNK> to mend a great <UNK> in my worked muslin gown , before they are <UNK> up . 1.8957356524063758
" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . " " You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! If my vanity had taken a <UNK> turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <UNK> . " On Miss Lucas ' s <UNK> , however , she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . " And gravely glancing at Mr . Darcy , " There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with ' <UNK> your breath to cool your <UNK> , ' and I shall keep mine to <UNK> my song . " Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . 1.1441409564019525
We were married , you know , at St . <UNK> ' s , because Wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish . 2.610157215682537
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . 4.641588833612778
Give me farther particulars . 100.00000000000004
Long and the Gouldings soon . 46.415888336127786
" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . 8.11130830789687
A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . 5.179474679231212
You need not . 316.22776601683796
It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed <UNK> ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among <UNK> woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its <UNK> parts . 1.7301957388458942
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so <UNK> with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and <UNK> of her own family ! 1.7301957388458942
Gardiner abused her stupidity . 100.00000000000004
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . 1.93069772888325
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " " <UNK> do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 1.3485595530525598
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 3.359818286283782
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 6.812920690579612
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected . 2.7213387683753076
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 3.1622776601683795
" Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 1.8957356524063758
that abominable Mr . Darcy ! My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to <UNK> it . 2.2758459260747883
or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " " My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . 1.8329807108324359
I will read it to you " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles <UNK> to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <UNK> <UNK> . 1.2843862635897427
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . 1.5085907086001784
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ? 5.878016072274914
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 2.9935772947204895
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with <UNK> civility , " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ? 1.7534865500829584
<UNK> him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her . 1.8957356524063758
I will speak to her about it myself directly . 10.000000000000002
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 4.216965034285822
Its business office is located at North <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , . 4.216965034285822
That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <UNK> in town , as Mr . Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . 1.4174741629268053
To no creature had it been revealed , where <UNK> was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 1.5441135899948315
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of <UNK> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . 1.6876124757881477
They agree with me in <UNK> that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the <UNK> of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself <UNK> says , will connect themselves with such a family . 1.7082763938087104
Her affections had been continually <UNK> , but never without an object . 5.878016072274914
It was all conjecture . " " What is it you mean ? " " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing . " " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . " " And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . 1.333521432163324
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the <UNK> light , seemed most improbable . 3.359818286283782
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two . 2.1017480113324885
" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . 3.593813663804627
He was very fond of them . " This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham ' s being among them . 2.8480358684358014
<UNK> as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . 3.1622776601683795
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth . 2.1017480113324885
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . 1.2560585988318853
Can I speak <UNK> ? 100.00000000000004
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? 1.4977474763452014
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . 2.7213387683753076
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for <UNK> him also with Lizzy . 2.51188643150958
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it . 1.3287913432286882
Lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . 2.0535250264571463
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 12.915496650148839
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . " " My dear , you flatter me . 1.53174046370208
" Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? 5.878016072274914
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 10.000000000000002
" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! 1.4677992676220695
But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! 17.78279410038923
He has more to give . 46.415888336127786
There is a <UNK> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . 3.359818286283782
But I have other <UNK> . 46.415888336127786
If I were not afraid of judging <UNK> , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . 2.2122162910704493
" Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . 1.425102670302998
Hurst and Miss Bingley . 100.00000000000004
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . 1.93069772888325
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character . 2.2758459260747883
Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . 17.78279410038923
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . 1.8047217668271702
There was also a <UNK> of one thousand pounds . 10.000000000000002
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <UNK> . 4.216965034285822
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 1.7082763938087104
" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . " Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . 1.5199110829529336
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 1.3485595530525598
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a <UNK> as this . 2.154434690031884
" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <UNK> , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss <UNK> ' s . " " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . " " Oh ! 1.338388753173757
" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any <UNK> , rather adds to your other perfections . 2.2758459260747883
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . " " Indeed ! " " Yes the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> . 1.396135390856794
Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in <UNK> . 2.2122162910704493
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . 1.615598098439874
I was never more <UNK> ! 46.415888336127786
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others . 1.93069772888325
She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 8.11130830789687
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 1.3894954943731377
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 2.346228848142263
But it is of small importance . " " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and <UNK> me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? 1.5199110829529336
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and <UNK> them up , though as she never came without <UNK> some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or <UNK> , she seldom went away without leaving them more <UNK> than she found them . 1.4977474763452014
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Here , <UNK> , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . 3.359818286283782
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 1.5706464294715548
The first week of their return was soon gone . 10.000000000000002
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . 2.346228848142263
Their fortune on both sides is splendid . 17.78279410038923
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 2.4244620170823286
" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr . Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing after all . I consider it as one of the first <UNK> of polished societies . " " Certainly , Sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in <UNK> amongst the less polished societies of the world . Every <UNK> can dance . " Sir William only smiled . 1.3768571648527583
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her <UNK> of Mrs . 5.878016072274914
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . 2.154434690031884
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I <UNK> believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . 1.4497406703726319
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . 6.812920690579612
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . 2.346228848142263
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . 3.1622776601683795
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 2.610157215682537
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Collins and myself sincerely <UNK> with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the <UNK> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 1.8329807108324359
This Mrs . 2154.4346900318833
All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . 1.7082763938087104
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 1.557068404753731
One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 1.4585940117250362
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , <UNK> , absurd . 2.154434690031884
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his <UNK> to myself . 2.0535250264571463
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an <UNK> man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a <UNK> , had nothing to say to her . 1.4174741629268053
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 4.641588833612778
It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . 2.346228848142263
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 2.0092330025650473
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 2.610157215682537
Bennet could hardly contain herself . 46.415888336127786
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you ! 4.641588833612778
I thank you for explaining it so fully . 12.915496650148839
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . 1.7534865500829584
I am impatient to see him . " " In point of <UNK> , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective . 2.4244620170823286
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . 5.179474679231212
It is Mr . Bingley I am sure . 12.915496650148839
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 5.878016072274914
Her answer was warmly in his favour . 17.78279410038923
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . 10.000000000000002
She often tried to provoke Darcy into <UNK> her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . 2.346228848142263
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 2.0535250264571463
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better <UNK> room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . 1.338388753173757
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . 1.8329807108324359
She will not be able to help calling . " " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 1.3593563908785256
But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . 6.812920690579612
I fancy she was wanted about the <UNK> <UNK> . 10.000000000000002
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . 6.812920690579612
Mr . Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . 2.4244620170823286
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . 2.154434690031884
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . 3.1622776601683795
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a <UNK> denial , and ride off as fast as I could . " " Would Mr . Darcy then consider the <UNK> of your original intention as <UNK> for by your obstinacy in <UNK> to it ? " " Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . " " You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . 1.2175031274276027
" He only told me , what I have now told you . " Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart <UNK> with indignation . 2.2122162910704493
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . 5.179474679231212
CHAPTER IX . 2154.4346900318833
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 1.3153690504363762
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , <UNK> to invite him to sit by herself . 3.359818286283782
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , <UNK> over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in <UNK> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 1.396135390856794
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . 2.51188643150958
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and <UNK> of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their <UNK> . 1.41011239906908
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . 1.93069772888325
She was going to the <UNK> ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of <UNK> , just fit to be killed . " Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . 1.5199110829529336
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s t te t te with Mrs . 2.4244620170823286
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his <UNK> to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm . 1.7082763938087104
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <UNK> have alarmed her . 2.8480358684358014
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention . 2.4244620170823286
" To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . 3.593813663804627
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her . 2.1017480113324885
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her . 2.2122162910704493
CHAPTER I . 2154.4346900318833
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . 2.2758459260747883
How could I be so silly as to wish it ! 8.11130830789687
Every thing that is charming ! 46.415888336127786
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 2154.4346900318833
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 1.8632463119315603
I am prodigiously proud of him . 26.82695795279726
For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently . 2.4244620170823286
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost . 2.4244620170823286
<UNK> was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth " My dearest Lizzy , " I <UNK> myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . 1.6681005372000588
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . 2.51188643150958
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
Yet he is such a man ! " " Yes , yes , they must marry . 3.8746751204561316
If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was <UNK> done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . With respect to that other , more <UNK> <UNK> , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only <UNK> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 1.365007806546014
" Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " From the former . 1.8329807108324359
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . 1.8632463119315603
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 2.2758459260747883
" But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not <UNK> his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . 1.778279410038923
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . 5.179474679231212
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her . 2.346228848142263
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 1.2618568830660204
Annesley is with her . 100.00000000000004
Bennet could hardly comprehend it . 46.415888336127786
" I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends . 2.610157215682537
Jane looked a little <UNK> than usual , but more <UNK> than Elizabeth had expected . 4.216965034285822
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 1.7082763938087104
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 2.9935772947204895
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . 3.8746751204561316
She is unfortunately of a sickly <UNK> , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who <UNK> her education , and who still <UNK> with them . 1.632172128563275
When the ladies were <UNK> for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> . 2.2122162910704493
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! 26.82695795279726
II . 100000.00000000001
They agreed that Mrs . 100.00000000000004
Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs . 1.1937766417144364
Bennet , alarmed . 316.22776601683796
Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent <UNK> and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . " Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " You cannot have a right to such very strong <UNK> attachment . 1.4174741629268053
Collins knew not what to make of him . 12.915496650148839
What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! 12.915496650148839
how acutely did she now feel it . 17.78279410038923
what is it about ? 100.00000000000004
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " " Are you , indeed ? 3.359818286283782
The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 1.6496480740980204
She had no fear of its <UNK> farther , through his means . 5.878016072274914
Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise . 12.915496650148839
Jane now came up . 100.00000000000004
Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described . 5.179474679231212
The hill , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . 2.51188643150958
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
A little time therefore . I shall certainly try to get the better . " With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . " " My dear Jane ! " exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good . 1.365007806546014
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . " " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 1.4873521072935114
Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a <UNK> season , made her feel that the <UNK> , <UNK> , most thread bare <UNK> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <UNK> . 1.3111339374215643
nonsense , how can you talk so ! 17.78279410038923
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not <UNK> me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . 1.4497406703726319
" My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . " They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . " " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence . " " You cannot be too much on your guard . 1.1558276558669076
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , <UNK> , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . 1.615598098439874
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . 2.9935772947204895
What is it you are talking of ? 17.78279410038923
<UNK> to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . 8.11130830789687
In Lydia ' s imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of <UNK> happiness . 3.8746751204561316
You will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . " He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit <UNK> long . 1.4873521072935114
I shall never forget her appearance this morning . 12.915496650148839
You know him too well to doubt the rest . 10.000000000000002
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 4.216965034285822
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 10.000000000000002
The particulars , I reserve till we meet . 12.915496650148839
" It must not be thought of . 17.78279410038923
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely . 2.346228848142263
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 2.7213387683753076
Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed . 1.3894954943731377
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . 5.179474679231212
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . 1.5441135899948315
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she <UNK> in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . 1.5848931924611136
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W . 2.7213387683753076
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " Darcy mentioned his letter . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . " " No , no . 3.8746751204561316
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold enough to say before how much I like him . 1.9684194472866121
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . 1.8329807108324359

Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . " " Are you quite sure , Ma ' am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said Jane . " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . " " Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . " " Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . 1.2305240043592616

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . " " But my father cannot . He wrote last week to hurry my return . " " Oh ! 2.2122162910704493
Mr . Collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . 1.93069772888325
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " I saw you look at me to day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . 1.5085907086001784
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . " " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . " " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . 1.4030037231905736
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! 4.216965034285822
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr . Bennet , have you no more <UNK> <UNK> in which Lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " " I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs . 1.353876180022544
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 1.4030037231905736
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . 2.0092330025650473
No , no I feel he may defy us there . 8.11130830789687
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest <UNK> , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any <UNK> display of regard , or any <UNK> of manner , where their two <UNK> only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 1.3830728955554412
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 1.41011239906908
The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion . 6.812920690579612
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane . 2.0535250264571463
Now is your time . 100.00000000000004
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the <UNK> , and was soon out of sight . 2.0092330025650473
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
" I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . 2.1017480113324885
Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . " " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . 1.632172128563275
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 1.5706464294715548
" But so we all do . 26.82695795279726
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 3.359818286283782
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . 8.11130830789687
CHAPTER IV . 2154.4346900318833
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . 3.359818286283782
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 1.93069772888325
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or <UNK> distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more <UNK> blind . 1.5848931924611136
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a <UNK> situation , and always spending more than they ought . 2.7213387683753076
But Mrs . 2154.4346900318833
Bennet , " I am quite delighted with him . 10.000000000000002
It was only said , ' <UNK> , George Wickham , <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a <UNK> , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! 2.346228848142263
He had never had the slightest suspicion . 17.78279410038923
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 3.1622776601683795
But it is so strange ! " " Yes that is what makes it amusing . 4.216965034285822
You are not well enough ; you cannot go yourself . " Elizabeth hesitated , but her <UNK> <UNK> under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . 1.8632463119315603
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . 4.641588833612778
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . 3.8746751204561316
Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a <UNK> air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . 1.7534865500829584
I dare say he often <UNK> worse things said than I am going to say . 4.216965034285822
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . " " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be <UNK> beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen . 1.4977474763452014
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 1.8632463119315603
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from <UNK> my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . 1.8329807108324359
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . 5.878016072274914
Lydia <UNK> as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very <UNK> solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips <UNK> of turning away <UNK> , and if he does , Colonel Forster will <UNK> him . 1.5199110829529336
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 3.359818286283782
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the coachman ' s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs . 1.3593563908785256
Are not you curious to hear how it was <UNK> ? " " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . " " La ! 1.8632463119315603
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature . 3.359818286283782
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . 1.9684194472866121
Her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 3.1622776601683795
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <UNK> her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 1.5998587196060583
" I did not know that you intended to walk , " said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . 2.4244620170823286
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> . 1.3111339374215643
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . 2.610157215682537
The garden <UNK> to the road , the house standing in it , the <UNK> pales and the <UNK> <UNK> , every thing declared they were <UNK> . 2.2758459260747883
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ' s performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste . 2.9935772947204895
here comes Hill . 316.22776601683796
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , <UNK> my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " " It is well . 1.7082763938087104
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself . 3.593813663804627
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 2.9935772947204895
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder . 2.8480358684358014
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . 3.1622776601683795
Lady Catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . 3.359818286283782
Elizabeth hoped she had <UNK> him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 2.51188643150958
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of <UNK> the mind of his wife . 1.396135390856794
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes <UNK> , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . 2.610157215682537
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 1.3708385261355818
<UNK> me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . " Elizabeth could not refuse , though she <UNK> little pleasure in the visit . 2.51188643150958
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . 6.812920690579612
The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . 1.8329807108324359
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? 2.8480358684358014
She is almost three and twenty ! 26.82695795279726
She is gone down to her uncle at <UNK> ; gone to stay . 5.179474679231212
" Are you not diverted ? " " Oh ! 10.000000000000002
But there was still something <UNK> behind , of which prudence <UNK> the <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
They will take care not to <UNK> their income . 10.000000000000002
<UNK> felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . 1.5706464294715548
Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . 17.78279410038923
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . 2.51188643150958
Collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too . 1.8632463119315603
You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her <UNK> , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . 1.7082763938087104
The officers will find women better worth their notice . 10.000000000000002
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . 5.179474679231212
" How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! " cried Lydia . 6.812920690579612
That lady I suppose is your mother . " Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . 3.8746751204561316
Not like the wild young men now a days , who think of nothing but themselves . 3.8746751204561316
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 2.7213387683753076
Let the other young ladies have time to <UNK> . " Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . <UNK> of the party were now applied to . 1.5085907086001784
Her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 1.7082763938087104
CHAPTER XVIII . 2154.4346900318833
" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . 1.53174046370208
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark , and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks , unless you receive <UNK> permission . 2.51188643150958
" No ; but it must be done soon . " Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . 2.346228848142263
Her mother <UNK> <UNK> , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 1.6496480740980204
There was also a postscript to this effect . 12.915496650148839
Poor Jane ! 2154.4346900318833
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! 5.878016072274914
Yet he knew to the contrary himself . 17.78279410038923
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 1.7534865500829584
Do not distress me by the idea . 17.78279410038923
He placed himself by her . 46.415888336127786
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 1.7534865500829584
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 1.5441135899948315
If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession . 1.93069772888325
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . " " You may depend upon it , Madam , " said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , " that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . " Mrs . 1.5706464294715548
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that . 5.179474679231212
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . 3.1622776601683795
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring . 6.812920690579612
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at <UNK> ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . 1.7082763938087104
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its <UNK> was visiting and news . 3.359818286283782
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . 1.2990813969063477
But she is perfectly amiable , and often <UNK> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . " " Has she been presented ? 2.2122162910704493
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though <UNK> with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 1.3894954943731377
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly <UNK> at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 2.51188643150958
The dejection was almost universal . 46.415888336127786
For God ' s sake , say no more of his partners . 5.878016072274914
I was uncomfortable enough . 100.00000000000004
Mr . Collins ! " " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . 2.51188643150958
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . 3.8746751204561316
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . 2.51188643150958
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <UNK> , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 1.425102670302998
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . 2.7213387683753076
Indeed he has no improper pride . 26.82695795279726
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " " You have . 1.5706464294715548
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband . 1.5706464294715548
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face . 2.8480358684358014
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins . 2.0535250264571463
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . 4.216965034285822
It would be dreadful ! 100.00000000000004
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 2.346228848142263
Gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , <UNK> of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 1.2915496650148839
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . " " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were <UNK> and insolent . 1.2478254704700218
For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . 1.8329807108324359
The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 1.778279410038923
You alluded to something else . 46.415888336127786
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . " " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us . 1.4030037231905736
" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . " " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . " Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . 1.3433993325989002
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , <UNK> Lucases . 2.0535250264571463
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . 3.1622776601683795
" I hope , " added Mrs . 17.78279410038923
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 1.7534865500829584
I did not think Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . 3.8746751204561316
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 1.7534865500829584
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him . 4.641588833612778
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . 6.812920690579612
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . 2.610157215682537
This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . 2.9935772947204895
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . 4.216965034285822
A person may be proud without being vain . 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 1.8957356524063758
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . 3.1622776601683795
How strange must it appear to him ! 17.78279410038923
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister . 10.000000000000002
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <UNK> . 1.7534865500829584
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley . 2.9935772947204895
Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and <UNK> passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . 1.4773776525985112
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . 2.1017480113324885
Forster , the delight of Mrs . 26.82695795279726
I have not the smallest hope . 26.82695795279726
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . 6.812920690579612
It was agreed to . 100.00000000000004
Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <UNK> . 1.4977474763452014
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 6.812920690579612
A regard for the <UNK> would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . 2.51188643150958
" My dear <UNK> , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of <UNK> each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s t te t te between two women can never end without a quarrel . 1.4873521072935114
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . 2.346228848142263
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . 3.593813663804627
Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 4.216965034285822
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother . 5.179474679231212
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . 4.216965034285822
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 1.8957356524063758
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 5.179474679231212
I shall see her in January . 26.82695795279726
" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . 2.610157215682537
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it . 1.5085907086001784
Kitty <UNK> and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . 5.878016072274914
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 3.593813663804627
Collins . 100000.00000000001
His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 2.7213387683753076
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 2.4244620170823286
Her answer , therefore , was not <UNK> , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . 2.4244620170823286
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that . 1.632172128563275
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 2.7213387683753076
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted , is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK> their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and <UNK> them earnestly . But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . 1.0847650620226836
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <UNK> ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 2.51188643150958
He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia . 8.11130830789687
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . " To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . 1.8329807108324359
" Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " I have , Sir . " " Very well . 2.610157215682537
Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ? 5.878016072274914
But in what <UNK> it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . 3.1622776601683795
Their powers of conversation were considerable . 26.82695795279726
Why must their marriage be private ? 26.82695795279726
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no <UNK> the frequent mention of Wickham ' s name . 2.8480358684358014
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . 2.2122162910704493
" She is so fond of Mrs . 17.78279410038923
My youngest sister has left all her friends has <UNK> ; has thrown herself into the power of of Mr . Wickham . 2.7213387683753076
About the <UNK> , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . " Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings . 2.0092330025650473
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . 5.179474679231212
Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces . 2.9935772947204895
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . 8.11130830789687
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there . 5.878016072274914
But , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 3.1622776601683795
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . 3.1622776601683795
What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a <UNK> of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . " " Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . " " And what arts did he use to separate them ? " " He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling . 1.1874815363065987
She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . 5.179474679231212
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 5.878016072274914
There is a mixture of <UNK> and self importance in his letter , which promises well . 3.8746751204561316
If he fears me , why come hither ? 12.915496650148839
" With my mother up stairs . 26.82695795279726
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . 2.610157215682537
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 3.8746751204561316
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 2.610157215682537
He is gone to my father already . 17.78279410038923
Miss Bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs . 5.179474679231212
How are you all ? " " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 2.7213387683753076
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . 4.216965034285822
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law . " The loss of her daughter made Mrs . 2.4244620170823286
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
Is nothing due to me on that score ? 12.915496650148839
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 5.878016072274914
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . 5.878016072274914
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 4.641588833612778
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 3.8746751204561316
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 1.7301957388458942
Bennet . 100000.00000000001
I was ready to die of laughter . 17.78279410038923
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 1.7301957388458942
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 1.557068404753731
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission . 2.4244620170823286
I depend on you for that . " To these high <UNK> expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the <UNK> of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . 1.2915496650148839
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 4.641588833612778
Well ! 100000.00000000001
I never saw such a long <UNK> in my life . 8.11130830789687
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . 2.4244620170823286
Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 1.778279410038923
Elizabeth longed to <UNK> its <UNK> ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . 2.51188643150958
Miss Bennet had <UNK> ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . 2.8480358684358014
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . 1.93069772888325
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 1.41011239906908
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . 3.1622776601683795
" Good Heaven ! 316.22776601683796
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 1.7082763938087104
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her <UNK> . 1.5998587196060583
It is impossible for me to be impartial . 12.915496650148839
Long will do any such thing . 26.82695795279726
Have you seen any pleasant men ? 26.82695795279726
Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , <UNK> that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ? 1.2195704601594413
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the <UNK> , but of that I <UNK> . 1.8047217668271702
He is a pleasant fellow , and would <UNK> you <UNK> . " " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 2.2758459260747883
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . 3.1622776601683795
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . 1.7082763938087104
. F . . Some states do not allow <UNK> of certain implied <UNK> or the exclusion or limitation of certain <UNK> of damages . 2.51188643150958
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . 2.8480358684358014
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <UNK> what <UNK> felicity really was . 3.8746751204561316
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . 1.9684194472866121
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of <UNK> in that way . 3.8746751204561316
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church . 2.51188643150958
I don ' t know . 46.415888336127786
I did not expect such a compliment . " " Did not you ? 5.179474679231212
Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn . 5.179474679231212
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will <UNK> you ; and so generous , that you will always <UNK> your income . " " I hope not so . 1.6681005372000588
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay . 3.593813663804627
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 17.78279410038923
Thank Heaven ! 2154.4346900318833
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . 12.915496650148839
On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . 1.2990813969063477
She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> . 1.7301957388458942
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . 1.4677992676220695
CHAPTER X . 2154.4346900318833
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . 1.8047217668271702
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 1.4412195967188537
I do not know who is good enough for him . " Mr . and Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . 2.154434690031884
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> ! 5.179474679231212
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . 2.8480358684358014
Gardiner ' s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are <UNK> against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 1.4030037231905736
My affections and wishes are <UNK> , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . " Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very <UNK> , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . 1.302994338575022
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <UNK> silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <UNK> between them again . 2.0535250264571463
I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . 5.179474679231212
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . 2.610157215682537
My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . 1.5706464294715548
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . 3.359818286283782
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 2.0092330025650473
" I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 1.615598098439874
I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a <UNK> up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 2.2122162910704493
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a <UNK> as that , it might be of essential consequence . 2.154434690031884
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . 4.641588833612778
Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
<UNK> as she was to admit an idea so <UNK> of Jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the <UNK> of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . 1.9684194472866121
He has not an ill natured look . 17.78279410038923
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and <UNK> <UNK> with great perseverance . 2.8480358684358014
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 1.4677992676220695
Gardiner . 100000.00000000001
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 2.9935772947204895
But you have chosen your fault well . I really cannot laugh at it . 4.641588833612778
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 4.641588833612778
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . 1.8632463119315603
But your arts and <UNK> may , in a moment of <UNK> , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . 2.2758459260747883
She was busily <UNK> through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . 1.8957356524063758
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <UNK> society . " " But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . " " Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . 1.6496480740980204
The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for <UNK> as may be <UNK> to himself and not offensive to his patron . 1.8957356524063758
" And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! 2.9935772947204895
Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <UNK> at whist , enumerating all the <UNK> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he <UNK> his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . 1.5998587196060583
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <UNK> , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room . 1.8632463119315603
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 2.7213387683753076
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr . <UNK> . 2.2758459260747883
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . 4.216965034285822
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? 5.878016072274914
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 2.0092330025650473
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . 6.812920690579612
Till this moment , I never knew myself . " From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . 1.5706464294715548
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character . 3.359818286283782
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry <UNK> , a very mean art . " " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is <UNK> in all the arts which ladies sometimes <UNK> to employ for <UNK> . 1.5848931924611136
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 1.632172128563275
I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 1.8957356524063758
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 6.812920690579612
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to <UNK> the fruits of her own <UNK> offence . 1.7082763938087104
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . 2.9935772947204895
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . 2.2122162910704493
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious . 1.3485595530525598
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . 5.179474679231212
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 1.4977474763452014
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . 1.6496480740980204
<UNK> nature is so prone to fall into it ! 10.000000000000002
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 1.202264434617413
" What could he mean ? 46.415888336127786
Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . " Mr . Bennet made no answer . 2.8480358684358014
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one <UNK> in it an object of compassion , while they are <UNK> of our intimacy at Rosings . " <UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> . 1.3593563908785256
CHAPTER VI . 2154.4346900318833
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr . Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent . 1.6876124757881477
<UNK> my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . 8.11130830789687
In the hall they parted . 46.415888336127786
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 8.11130830789687
Yours ever , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " With the officers ! " cried Lydia . 3.8746751204561316
but there were two or three much <UNK> in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to <UNK> it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . 1.93069772888325
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . 2.610157215682537
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 1.632172128563275
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! 1.8329807108324359
Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs . 3.359818286283782
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North . 2.1017480113324885
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be <UNK> . 3.593813663804627
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 1.9684194472866121
<UNK> , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . 1.615598098439874
" About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . " " Yes , " replied Wickham ; " his estate there is a noble one . 1.5441135899948315
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . " " Is that his design in settling here ? " " <UNK> ! 2.2758459260747883
CHAPTER II . 2154.4346900318833
She shared in their attendance on Mrs . 17.78279410038923
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . " " <UNK> their income ! 3.359818286283782
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . 2.4244620170823286
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . " Elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! 1.8047217668271702
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . 2.7213387683753076
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare <UNK> to listen to . 1.8329807108324359
But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . 3.359818286283782
Bingley and talked of Mrs . 46.415888336127786
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . 3.8746751204561316
Its <UNK> depended on others . 46.415888336127786
I know you will contrive it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . 1.3287913432286882
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 2.7213387683753076
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . 3.1622776601683795
What are we to do ! " would they often <UNK> in the bitterness of <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
" Oh ! 2154.4346900318833
At length the chaise arrived , the <UNK> were <UNK> on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . 2.51188643150958
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . 1.7534865500829584
Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and <UNK> her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family . 1.8329807108324359
You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not . 5.878016072274914
In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . 8.11130830789687
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in <UNK> affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? 1.9684194472866121
" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet ' s manor . 1.7082763938087104
The business was therefore soon settled . 26.82695795279726
Why any fear of detection ? 46.415888336127786
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 3.1622776601683795
Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 4.216965034285822
Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her <UNK> and <UNK> , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with Miss Bennet . 2.4244620170823286
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . 2.7213387683753076
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 2.7213387683753076
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . " " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? " " Indeed I had . 1.93069772888325
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 1.7534865500829584
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 2.1017480113324885
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 1.7301957388458942
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a <UNK> . 1.3768571648527583
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 3.8746751204561316
The party did not supply much conversation . 17.78279410038923
My father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . 1.6496480740980204
CHAPTER V . 2154.4346900318833
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 1.9684194472866121
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it . 1.338388753173757
" You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . " " I should be sorry indeed , if it were . 1.8632463119315603
She declared her resolution . 100.00000000000004
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . 2.8480358684358014
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . 2.9935772947204895
His character was to speak for itself . 17.78279410038923
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . 2.51188643150958
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <UNK> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . 1.615598098439874
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . 2.1017480113324885
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only <UNK> off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . " When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . 1.4330125702369627
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy . 1.8047217668271702
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . 3.8746751204561316
I will answer for it he never cared three <UNK> about her . 5.878016072274914
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . " " I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 1.4412195967188537
so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! 12.915496650148839
But I am at his disposal . 26.82695795279726
" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . " " Is my father in town ? " " Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . " " And have you heard from him often ? " " We have heard only once . 1.4873521072935114
Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . 10.000000000000002
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you . 3.8746751204561316
Not these two or three years perhaps . " " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can . 2.346228848142263
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . 3.8746751204561316
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley . 1.8329807108324359
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth <UNK> out the coffee , in so close a <UNK> , that there was not a single <UNK> near her , which would admit of a chair . 1.6681005372000588
They were natural and just . 46.415888336127786
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> . 2.2122162910704493
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 1.4873521072935114
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 2.154434690031884
Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . 2.610157215682537
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 1.4773776525985112
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . 2.8480358684358014
But do not be cast down . 26.82695795279726
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . " Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . 1.8329807108324359
" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said Mr . Gardiner . 3.8746751204561316
I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 2.7213387683753076
" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . 4.641588833612778
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s . 2.8480358684358014
By you , I was properly humbled . 17.78279410038923
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 3.593813663804627
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . " " In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . 1.7082763938087104
" Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . " He should be particularly happy at any time , c . 2.1017480113324885
Elizabeth took up some <UNK> , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . 2.9935772947204895
In , the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg tm and future generations . 2.51188643150958
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . 4.641588833612778
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 2.51188643150958
The pain of separation , however , might be <UNK> on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . 1.53174046370208
Bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . 4.216965034285822
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the <UNK> of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . 1.8957356524063758
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Mr . Darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <UNK> throughout the whole . 1.5441135899948315
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <UNK> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 1.4585940117250362
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . " " I am , " said he , with a firm voice . 2.2758459260747883
Mr . Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . 2.51188643150958
Mr . what ' s his name . 17.78279410038923
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 4.216965034285822
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . 4.641588833612778
I congratulate her . 316.22776601683796
Consider Mr . Collins ' s respectability , and Charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . 3.8746751204561316
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . 3.359818286283782
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . " " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 1.5199110829529336
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . " Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . 6.812920690579612
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 1.615598098439874
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . 2.1017480113324885
When I last saw her , she was not very promising . 6.812920690579612
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . 2.610157215682537
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 2.8480358684358014
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them . 1.4977474763452014
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . 12.915496650148839
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 2.0535250264571463
but no one can throw any blame on them . 10.000000000000002
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 2.610157215682537
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 1.8957356524063758
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . 8.11130830789687
She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . 2.154434690031884
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . " Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . 1.4330125702369627
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 1.3830728955554412
But it must not , shall not be . 12.915496650148839
" Your ' s , c . " This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be <UNK> , by the sister at least . 1.8957356524063758
III . 100000.00000000001
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . 3.8746751204561316
Her colour changed , and she said no more . 10.000000000000002
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a <UNK> fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered <UNK> to the repeated <UNK> of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 1.28792362543363

The day passed much as the day before had done . 8.11130830789687
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . " " To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 1.632172128563275
But I suppose you had no opportunity . 17.78279410038923
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was <UNK> for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . 1.365007806546014

Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . 10.000000000000002
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . 2.7213387683753076
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 17.78279410038923

But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be <UNK> into it ? " " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to <UNK> with rather more <UNK> the degree of importance which is to <UNK> to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . 1.176041196368325

Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for . 5.878016072274914

You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . 1.8957356524063758

May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with <UNK> and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as <UNK> an air as possible . " Mr . Bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . 1.324192791886045

Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one <UNK> of perfect <UNK> in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his <UNK> that her manners were not those of the <UNK> world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . 1.4977474763452014
I dearly love a laugh . " " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . 2.4244620170823286
His character was decided . 100.00000000000004

After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <UNK> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . 1.1937766417144364

<UNK> those who are at all his <UNK> in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . 2.4244620170823286

She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she <UNK> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .

She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left <UNK> , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country .

With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . 3.359818286283782

He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before . 1.557068404753731
How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? " " That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . 2.0092330025650473
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . 1.5085907086001784

But his pride , his abominable pride , his <UNK> avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in <UNK> , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . 1.365007806546014
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 1.2401035305418566
The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who <UNK> it , were familiar to them . 2.51188643150958

what news ? 2154.4346900318833
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . 1.632172128563275
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time . 2.9935772947204895

Mrs . 100000.00000000001
no . " " I can much more easily believe Mr . Bingley ' s being imposed on , than that Mr . Wickham should <UNK> such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , <UNK> , every thing mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr . Darcy contradict it . 1.4585940117250362
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 3.1622776601683795
" E . 2154.4346900318833
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy ' s regard . " " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? " " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . " " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy . 1.4330125702369627
" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the <UNK> that is laid on them , as nonsense ? 2.9935772947204895
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 1.5706464294715548
The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . 1.5848931924611136
His attachment to Rosings , certainly <UNK> . " Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 1.93069772888325
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself . 2.7213387683753076
Good girl ! 2154.4346900318833
" How strange this is ! 46.415888336127786
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 2.154434690031884
Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 2.154434690031884
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 1.5706464294715548

If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 1.93069772888325
Kitty and Lydia take his <UNK> much more to heart than I do . 5.179474679231212
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr .
