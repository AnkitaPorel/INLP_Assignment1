14.287950279485859
Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . 12.143528897836877
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? 24.719862201118975
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 13.28099709707859
Hurst was observing their game . 11.37052387170717
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . 15.67999151288915
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . 17.134719438876736
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 10.724276302809608
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 16.611976073394896
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? 15.696833776674618
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <UNK> by the possessor , and often without any attention to the <UNK> of the performance . 19.30675131141062
Her ladyship ' s carriage is <UNK> ordered for us . 19.618552139937194
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 10.14213416800661
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months . 10.488604819587069
Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . 9.47368842863345
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a <UNK> , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . " " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . 17.258528230235807
The Foundation ' s <UNK> or federal tax <UNK> number is . 39.839109938397414
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room . 11.70029276652908
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 12.873758641614335
" I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . " " Not at all , " he replied ; " they were <UNK> by the exercise . " A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . 12.762657530606592
Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . 9.233171440160511
Dear , dear Lizzy . 6.275069251722375
Kitty was the only one who <UNK> tears ; but she did <UNK> from vexation and envy . 22.283710583906938
What a good joke it will be ! 9.80597572178747
so much the man of fashion ! 7.0956295249796355
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 9.097516719725766
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . The possibility of his having really endured such <UNK> , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained . 16.535295722629236
I am not to be <UNK> into anything so wholly unreasonable . 16.123821193775424
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 19.93125517273044
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . 8.195181971582652
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 14.554962523551573
At that moment , she cared for no other . 7.9253278655401544
Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . 14.583783851926269
She now lost every expectation of pleasure . 10.173358405456078
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . 14.939389940214708
" His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . 6.934890967793315
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth . 9.224226542733806
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 18.875904993714965
Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very <UNK> said , " What is the matter mamma ? 12.810523906318673
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 17.518051374573112
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ' s visit . 15.068588375814484
You must and shall be married by a special licence . 12.903595708106634
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 12.065365501165457
Mr . Darcy may <UNK> himself . " " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried Elizabeth . 7.514004065693171
" <UNK> Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at <UNK> , if the drawing room were larger ; but <UNK> is too far off ! 19.470639994617358
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now . 9.239857699804924
What a contrast between him and his friend ! 10.957654010347364
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . 8.789017767029343
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 7.115579922116781
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <UNK> , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the <UNK> way for happiness . 19.439512742239618
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 12.436674245717779
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 17.33186089567907
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . 9.957771955484494
Lord bless me ! 13.796888804627931
I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to <UNK> such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room . 14.668831467728094
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . " She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . " Again his astonishment was <UNK> ; and he looked at her with an expression of <UNK> incredulity and mortification . 19.12825673020199
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 19.236212361459312
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such <UNK> , and her intreaty that she would not give into it . 13.248187720539166

Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! 13.288586718148212
You thought me then <UNK> of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . 14.058085024079748
Ten thousand a year ! 13.982432180805846
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . 9.236338926459892
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . 13.645303341042565
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . 17.246503647015256
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 14.311520530038877
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . 15.613693977548655
<UNK> nature is so prone to fall into it ! 22.752634348426707
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <UNK> of Mrs . 10.59530301199087
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party . 13.310588849525699
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring . 4.748039196224547
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have <UNK> either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . 18.433511477073488
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different <UNK> ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . 28.25517217114032
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s . 15.558776205058638
One seems so <UNK> without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth . 10.96903344736108
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 18.044023694408736
I do not wish to avoid the walk . 6.175309454850515
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 18.114755878904703
Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <UNK> at whist , enumerating all the <UNK> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he <UNK> his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . 26.009062137352807
But I knew I should persuade you at last . 8.085748272215003
You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! 15.823788996280685
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 15.221705713836885
His belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 13.603372854118765
But really , Ma ' am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . 16.74170141911986
And do you really love him quite well enough ? 13.104420176695024
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . 17.01179953118881
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 5.97059898029044
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> ! 10.241374538958361
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare <UNK> to listen to . 30.782574887099774
They were to be off as soon as possible . 6.920843185185893
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . 16.821005689883414
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . 13.439783287702186
Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . " " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . " " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " I honour your circumspection . 10.268288848895347
You see on what a footing we are . 9.833939709571206
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw <UNK> in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . 17.353978059127698
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 11.011794734756272
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 11.436846757171896
CHAPTER <UNK> . 8.805540922633503
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . 8.171241057538591
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 15.91986229160575
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 12.458736190254545
Mr . Collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . 19.75467073041432
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 14.446626891030379
<UNK> it , Kitty ? " Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . 14.769023849102677
I want to talk very seriously . 7.999124324869396
It is useless to talk of it . " It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . 12.979634536094999
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 4.485075851938364
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an <UNK> with her brother for talking such nonsense . 20.82647366695086
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 18.086784679525216
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> . 24.594521774924157
where is your <UNK> my dear ? " But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 12.821494901573923
It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . 10.496478351491614
Such very superior dancing is not often seen . 14.345546428387532
" <UNK> it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . " " Gracechurch street , Monday , <UNK> . 12.120650617213007
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? " " I think she will . 10.802004638929978
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another . 16.21304825482605
You will be a very happy woman . " Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 10.676474349618184
Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . 12.051487809563707
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . 15.141592005081963
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . 11.85599770541808
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . 16.80863601183102
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is <UNK> . " " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs . 11.325794337896363
Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and <UNK> . 14.729114484987273
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 16.486142833206497
To know that her daughter would be married was enough . 8.270284081985256
single , my dear , to be sure ! 5.712324584234155
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the <UNK> of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . 17.97754791550703
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <UNK> to her <UNK> , afforded no <UNK> of her distress . 30.01784398658178
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband . 16.118504640041124
But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! 9.172858748339062
It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . " " Oh ! 9.949208004384724
Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the <UNK> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . 16.533478614158497
It will not do . 4.001904764915435
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? 19.456254916428968
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 21.03590583104326
I thought we never should have got into the coach . 10.985592095615901
There was also a postscript to this effect . 10.778138827631642
They must all go to Brighton . 7.095824737076505
Five daughters <UNK> entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . 13.782499118107257
Adieu . 4.786647597434485
It is a pity they are not handsome ! 10.075473408032535
I have not the smallest hope . 4.921614357766776
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head <UNK> acutely . 24.85819853459456
How is half such a sum to be repaid ? " Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . 13.936787905533873
" Oh , Jane , take care . " " My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . " " I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . " They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs . 10.516282111148035
It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed <UNK> ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among <UNK> woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its <UNK> parts . 23.42028088587226
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to <UNK> the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 14.009983200427474
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . 12.648332317046167
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? 9.89363013541095
It was a large , well <UNK> room , handsomely fitted up . 16.47906893599817
But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . 10.434279139989103
But when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ' s <UNK> all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 20.421169082809868
" Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " I have , Sir . " " Very well . 8.554628090197562
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> . 25.9500430682693
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 18.94645071276247

But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . 5.7668969198647755
<UNK> had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and <UNK> her disgust of Mr . Collins . 15.596731289013858
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . 16.37451230946387
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 16.801589104295868
<UNK> and <UNK> I can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart . 29.859136836776457
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 9.88055510191079
Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master . 17.19894101894982
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . 12.273024453411377
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . 10.42934211634839
<UNK> as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . 15.45099601760717
<UNK> back the servant , therefore , she <UNK> him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost <UNK> , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly . 23.07866889525909
The evening passed quietly , <UNK> by any thing extraordinary . 19.08711527708771
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 16.846749798684343
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time . 12.481380615457756
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 11.347211869477846
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . 8.708163210157128
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 17.849218708948598
" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . " " It is no such thing . 11.15476252208552
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . 4.32165080369688
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners <UNK> respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 18.774512728478335
I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . 9.108339092218364
Long and the Gouldings soon . 7.52153468008962
" To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . 8.097573968270765
She <UNK> Miss <UNK> a treasure . 23.44503555973535
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 21.854598592467504
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . " " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister . 14.339760788913264
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them . 8.279950153886444
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . 16.410607976451598
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 13.370927097288646
<UNK> recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be <UNK> . 17.16728854699692
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . 18.554933108505317
In spite of her deeply <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger . 19.126906456235936
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . 14.715783641345517
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 10.952963760319584
Mr . Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the <UNK> and go to sleep . 11.38736458210561
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to <UNK> ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . 24.917242943612735
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them . " This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret . 15.345707016047983
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 12.313876815973366
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her <UNK> , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . " " She had better have <UNK> at home , " cried Elizabeth ; " perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours . 14.597361516601756

In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one <UNK> in it an object of compassion , while they are <UNK> of our intimacy at Rosings . " <UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> . 23.08547675435741
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy ' s regard . " " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? " " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . " " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy . 11.560213186891538
in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 11.946442631849687
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . 14.874320354572545
Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . 15.444035972827542
CHAPTER VI . 7.22349596044539
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 12.332175685813235
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . 15.016120826586308
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . 18.9503435384979
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 17.13491025613155
It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be <UNK> , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham . 18.228305127600162
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 13.738889702690953
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . 21.69158814688349
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of <UNK> , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 20.975667080940223
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . 11.617429453592713
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . 20.238362076941193
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " CHAPTER XVIII . 11.351259893884864
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . " " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . 15.484911188413783
Gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . 17.353970457780274
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . 12.75456544307957
I shall never forget her appearance this morning . 9.9985732828032
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . 10.517408440129566
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 8.810357479983963
Who would have thought it ! 8.455921660330157
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it . 15.075341382526078
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . " " For heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr . Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . " Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . 16.163249004693782
Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side . 14.01019479991025
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were <UNK> of dejection . 17.70823176493115
Those who do not complain are never pitied . " Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or <UNK> her would only increase the irritation . 26.633838030547505
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 32.79228004489716
and so extremely accomplished for her age ! 11.227884871517073
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . 11.830510709184017
We have heard nothing from town . " " Dear madam , " cried Mrs . 10.42835029678605
Mr . Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . 19.673286371004107
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <UNK> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <UNK> . 22.556173617425422
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted <UNK> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <UNK> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . 27.303431693027537
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 17.529733804012146
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . 15.996165158750243

She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 18.26810857731383
and what can he have to say ? " " Something very much to the purpose of course . 7.772286143562586
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 11.450140581714557
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his <UNK> . 22.62582039703514
Gardiner . 2.6911073080185557
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 18.90783423555223
All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . 19.075606778925565
A few weeks , he believed . 8.627854968376653
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr . Wickham . 16.279517537316543
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can <UNK> a woman . " " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? 13.399242329047809
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . 6.1734909747391935
such an openness and gentleness in his manner . " " There certainly was some great <UNK> in the education of those two young men . 17.459139202773024
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be <UNK> to you to let them go alone . " " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " " Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . 17.401398435050634
Her mind was less difficult to <UNK> . 14.875505961365903
" I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr . Darcy ! " " It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . " " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . " " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . " " <UNK> ! 12.58227371599331
I have not been accustomed to such language as this . 8.510519584251819
" My dear , dear Lydia ! " she cried " This is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing . 16.599867031572387
My youngest sister has left all her friends has <UNK> ; has thrown herself into the power of of Mr . Wickham . 16.68798794935291
I believe I have now told you every thing . 7.17460524173972
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 10.648866833650494
Illustration <UNK> <UNK> PRIDE PREJUDICE . 58.325028092708955
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> . 12.037834765554251
" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . 6.7704741631534
Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . 17.90608514901884
Such were the gentle <UNK> of Mrs . 12.48738005376571
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . 11.954636328502318
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 9.589794554144293
" This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! 12.507513366107897
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! 11.349461733066864
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 16.075802998904916
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 14.743685962860736
In pompous <UNK> on his side , and civil <UNK> on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton . 22.32363092284924
" I admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he . 10.46693980442748
Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs . 9.539884912622073
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 8.520693083296091
Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . 13.347617096909545
" And may I ask ? " said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . " " <UNK> with ! 8.340215546060172
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . " Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . 21.367850197184463
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 11.80110570364706
People do not die of little trifling <UNK> . 23.850722721647955
But she is perfectly amiable , and often <UNK> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . " " Has she been presented ? 22.617098581602132
and to see dear Wickham too ! 6.539055939476394
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . 15.887761530501338
You see how continually we are engaged there . 14.286582814043502
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? 15.434042308943933
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed . 16.25593105743849
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . 5.322151038243059
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 12.307852941848749
Jane was by no means better . 6.3864794267173846
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
what is it about ? 5.292940987376046
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . 14.790453048573982
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . 18.155668609152652
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . 21.500375322130832
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 19.300884696983193
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <UNK> her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 14.491900008562027
You have delighted us long enough . 10.004432231194025
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night . 14.64244775914719
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse . 21.08416936974357
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , <UNK> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 19.570503750179135
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 19.050580214112728
Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 17.032897511054678
" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your <UNK> appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . " " Oh ! 19.833601175368123
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 16.31284746302617
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a <UNK> . 13.40271611828017
A clergyman like you must marry . <UNK> properly , chuse a <UNK> for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . 22.693800859531287
It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . 33.21710205012731
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 19.596971970603985
Mr . Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . 14.222205233465965
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . 9.5577441460774
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 11.218489387664683
He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father ' s intentions . 17.94075927752754
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 17.697056182764616
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . 15.718040706029976
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 11.320331696073705
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . 12.551922191124172
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 17.18012988590436
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? 12.25444066116182
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia . 13.752158195216568
no . I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . " " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may <UNK> our different opinions . " " No I cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . " " The present always <UNK> you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt . 15.322203155866289
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <UNK> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . 17.733625657290496
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy ! 11.06970985602035
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . 8.590816930875343
it must be my uncle ' s doings ! 10.17513915285389
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? 11.429804703610449
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " Their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . 21.371806315621885
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage . 13.009825612977467
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? 30.675548034180167
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my <UNK> . " " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . 16.014797072236483
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . 9.84851717306856
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 23.617551674208666
Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 9.87213591549491
" I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . 9.465605568089757
Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . 8.954748418990057
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs . 20.37282357291838
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> ! 16.918208412170973
To no creature had it been revealed , where <UNK> was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 17.80078067848828
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 17.128637877934526
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in <UNK> affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? 17.49188888610013
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . 17.2587918655612
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 10.767817726392192
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . " " In what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought Elizabeth . 18.15801636270578
Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 10.096239129975558
The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who <UNK> it , were familiar to them . 16.163454757093778
When the ladies were <UNK> for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> . 14.747449362602007
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . 12.555913112528916
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . 20.693080738140694
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . 15.508590122782023
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 25.45318983743805
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . 10.821929426136684
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . 18.004735888410238
CHAPTER XII . 7.2234956205320096
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 8.544501757043614
How are they even to be discovered ? 10.319909225659815
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . 21.610756669704003
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 14.945179965100102
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 13.84454296369156
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 11.821921115119732
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his <UNK> powers had gained him in the <UNK> . 19.110304246453303
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 9.327170391122584
" I hope , " added Mrs . 3.6584060531608062
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . " " Lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . " " I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a <UNK> of character . 13.79284401049036
I quite detest the man . " CHAPTER IV . 9.80065983185644
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . 16.04901801086738
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
The time fixed for the beginning of their <UNK> tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . 19.084403294708345
Yours ever , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " With the officers ! " cried Lydia . 13.876605084746439
Teaze him laugh at him . <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . " " But upon my honour I do not . 10.522738742798934
" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir . 9.756663758724928
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . 9.004146906946461
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . 9.530943209481315
Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 7.367329116449565
Elizabeth felt Jane ' s pleasure . 6.3702312618195895
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her <UNK> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . 18.93780847456072
Mr . Collins ! " " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . 9.38766768630551

She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself . 12.728838433740174
Bennet , having <UNK> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . 23.724328942243
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one <UNK> of perfect <UNK> in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his <UNK> that her manners were not those of the <UNK> world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . 25.114518509663487
<UNK> are settled so <UNK> . " " You <UNK> perhaps to the entail of this estate . " " Ah ! 18.934307289521396
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 14.121218105458496
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . 15.147779949034744
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <UNK> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 18.65931006338093
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 17.73895631902924
Mary <UNK> for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . 22.286125866668083
She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent . 9.90454496532193

Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 13.139056099949027
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . 14.60456559798148
It is highly improper . 9.572542241652927
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 18.25920600119059
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . " " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . 14.540436682063396
He heard her with astonishment . 6.021983286331929
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . 10.422348206343992
How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr . Bingley ? " " Not at all . " " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . 13.528437974692718
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . 21.761389662300033

Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give <UNK> confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr . Darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr . Darcy in a most infamous manner . 14.60977009059335
I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 12.17959963201303
" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . " Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . 16.889353510116504
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . 17.439281408087734
And then we were so merry all the way home ! 13.99686110816478
<UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . 15.872316486682024
what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . 11.785154916977685
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , <UNK> , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . 29.49937500176978
" A man who has once been refused ! 14.316377231513322
The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . 18.320212693962638
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . " " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be . 12.35401445466614

What relates to yourself , is as follows . 9.57869036796355
" What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? " " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . " " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . 11.17339915262613
" I do not get on at all . 4.688350494056878
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 17.7984095285681
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 16.76510917625536
" I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham . 8.018719084767355
Wickham ! 3.669587287171052
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a <UNK> of emotion they excited . 15.347453509235477
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! 13.940170532991816
I am very , very sorry . 4.390745127536551
" She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . 10.428836714568607
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever <UNK> , and the <UNK> friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . 13.88555860229952
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 14.566586687164724
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the <UNK> of red <UNK> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 21.371802020317887
His reception however was of the most flattering kind . 11.96380586380395
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 19.3708639531994

The <UNK> letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 12.083138567250735
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . " " But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . " " Let me be rightly understood . 16.9156129413047

What could your ladyship propose by it ? " " At once to insist upon having such a report universally <UNK> .

How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 17.334695439722505
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way . 8.804129882696433

But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 16.73064094606052
The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in <UNK> and <UNK> , and the evening at one of the <UNK> . 16.45458746904785
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . 6.829090336922021
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ' s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . 13.971031823431334
He takes them now for people of fashion . " The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she <UNK> a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his <UNK> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . 17.668823548482568
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . 9.185891910748396
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , <UNK> painful to me . 11.217187004330693
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <UNK> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . 18.537046584724386
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . 9.655577906357902
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman <UNK> the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . 12.850077966027104
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 17.14877004751672
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . 19.9715036001895
Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . 18.943465255379724
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did . 14.250719463431604
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 10.772484578252707
Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 13.798465602819457
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . " Kitty , who took all these <UNK> in a serious light , began to <UNK> . 20.140259807829572
<UNK> at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . 17.0582228933549
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <UNK> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . 13.447292272703327
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? 15.73110985540862
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " I never heard that it was . " " And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . 15.320877908643842
Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . 11.192741185797352
<UNK> people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . 16.520285437580718
Your ' s , c . 5.426737047224089
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! 9.686939080788294
" But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . " Elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . 13.65295277829962
There is one point , on which I want your advice . 9.633220329046782
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good <UNK> engaged Mr . Collins ' s conversation to herself . 15.839436568703594
CHAPTER II . 6.996859120965737
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might <UNK> to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . 17.457832462489264
" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! " said she . 7.0021613103039995
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 15.674457133073862
Did he know of their intending to go off ? 12.656272610227795
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . 14.798999551334976
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . " As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . 17.60617390626139
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . 16.73811792357726
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 15.563739890641273
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <UNK> ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . 16.124137501527695
my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " Oh , lord ! 9.429339668498686
Mr . Darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . 7.930202009136325
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . 13.881214019121321
It is unaccountable ! 8.819870455625779
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . 14.824653164650151

Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 24.18386643210037
Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . 13.676186086081817
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 15.617373043347834
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . 10.868628641684557
Bingley was the principal <UNK> , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 10.399481540339758
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of <UNK> , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than <UNK> anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 25.190062157238174
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you . 10.76995261709164
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . 11.326591854348688
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . 13.904150476428805
" My dear <UNK> , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of <UNK> each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s t te t te between two women can never end without a quarrel . 24.81842016722515
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 12.893083649567886
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . 6.130955262405714
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . 14.077420274346142
Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 10.76357233872118
Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 6.114669851572672
Bennet was <UNK> the fire . 9.215056117492962
" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . 4.657708984465886
But my dear Lydia , I don ' t at all like your going such a way off . 14.090126326378794
" I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she . 5.856520352226376
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . 14.024031489018096
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 12.892312708299555
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . 13.618344325908618
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 20.927664437849295
CHAPTER VIII . 7.2234956205320096
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . " " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " And how impossible in others ! " " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? " " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . 15.482590226241733
But your family owe me nothing . 9.658991594314749
" Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . 14.425870762276814
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . 10.979070791088613
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 21.303749310990007
She went on . 4.297602787271201
Poor Lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . 11.664863660110726
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission . 9.22021027007554
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 9.609472136386994
Let the other young ladies have time to <UNK> . " Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . <UNK> of the party were now applied to . 15.23888810676071
But what is that to me ? 4.753968671505945
Mr . Collins ' s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . 9.91601737479862
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? " " Nearly three weeks . " " And you saw him frequently ? " " Yes , almost every day . " " His manners are very different from his cousin ' s . " " Yes , very different . 13.949836489726021
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . 13.707163514170249
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 13.883210623893886
I don ' t know . 8.720272405429238
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 21.538200859400327
She is quite a little creature . 7.505400761343929
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever . 13.857164280148034
You refuse , then , to oblige me . 6.814961326954643
By you , I was properly humbled . 8.426790739306055
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " Oh ! 15.858590416979148
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been <UNK> by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 18.13618329313343
" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . " " You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! If my vanity had taken a <UNK> turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <UNK> . " On Miss Lucas ' s <UNK> , however , she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . " And gravely glancing at Mr . Darcy , " There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with ' <UNK> your breath to cool your <UNK> , ' and I shall keep mine to <UNK> my song . " Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . 21.41212802696683
A house in town ! 8.525839882487388
In the first place , she persisted in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might be broken off . 15.83272327723184
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 9.795914087471495
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . 13.875332995834377
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 12.780859219466882
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . 8.201591564635507
" What do you think ? 6.004185003673735
He was full of joy and attention . 7.4476855956782755
For , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken <UNK> , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the <UNK> reproof . 22.36223330795414
My affections and wishes are <UNK> , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . " Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very <UNK> , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . 18.49299535345911
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . 12.20916737260974
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . 5.883017473676429
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . 8.302192684096172
He owns it himself without disguise . " " No " said Darcy , " I have made no such pretension . 11.284675905016497
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . 10.299141081253417
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . " " Indeed ! " " Yes the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> . 16.49787820275215
I appeal to Mr . Darcy but let me not interrupt you , Sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the <UNK> converse of that young lady , whose <UNK> eyes are also <UNK> me . " The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 23.81438901632437
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . 10.635526026339598
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 17.341768375668824
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . 30.4788919614605
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . 12.18104800837538
The visit was returned in due form . 11.958346863960848
Lydia ' s going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . 15.665995334324796
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy . 12.938152251590445
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . 9.425721571595542
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation . 17.23748567998784
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she <UNK> in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . 19.978338517795805
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . 14.764224003183067
They are my old friends . 9.066884589619937
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder . 20.833910876075368
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . 10.935370836974085
Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father . 15.621707593691264
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would <UNK> his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . 20.190541276103016
The others have been gone on to <UNK> , these three weeks . " She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . 13.734568795103748
nonsense , how can you talk so ! 9.91855074663679
There is nothing else to be done . 7.287980804822252
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly <UNK> . 17.483743103304423
No , no I feel he may defy us there . 10.464057848324744
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . 12.638758948515662
You are not going to be <UNK> , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . 13.747449132499815
The business was therefore soon settled . 9.008842494106572
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . " " Oh ! 9.845639907494034
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . 18.674443750021553
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 8.035863255090112
A great deal more passed at the other table . 12.143963717348386
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . 11.517812583908668
<UNK> to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . 20.331168303453758
It is admirable ! " Elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 19.631492743320038
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 19.446868756375103
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 10.574500844191373
A younger son , you know , must be <UNK> to self denial and dependence . " " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either . 17.00847334540046
who attended to you ? 5.589773546756448
His plan did not vary on seeing them . Miss Bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his <UNK> notions of what was due to <UNK> ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice . 24.85199656446459
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a <UNK> , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! 12.258571205825993
Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> . 22.316785345994226
my sweetest Lizzy ! 10.013298166011136
Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . 14.092280433345389
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . 14.2626844415423
I did not expect such a compliment . " " Did not you ? 7.617108584112888
it is of no consequence . 4.13569094189945
Collins well . " " Yes , very well . 4.522280296843282
sir , I do indeed . 5.2455632296644925
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will <UNK> you ; and so generous , that you will always <UNK> your income . " " I hope not so . 13.931286234547821
Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . 11.32695512034655
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs . 9.806014808551248
Charles , when you <UNK> your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 13.181472347590242
Lydia was Lydia still ; <UNK> , <UNK> , wild , noisy , and <UNK> . 16.701537112986095
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 17.969297482118233
" Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever <UNK> , that your resentment once created was <UNK> . 15.841558830765825
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . 12.54955895107231
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 17.439781844946438
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . 15.403112410050834
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . 7.663402552524619
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of <UNK> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . 18.315560832678194
I am sick of them all . 5.464364654735614
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good <UNK> will <UNK> it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth <UNK> lest her mother should be exposing herself again . 26.19961071584172
<UNK> back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write <UNK> . 16.93987787730115
. F . . Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph . F . , this work is provided to you ' <UNK> <UNK> ' , <UNK> NO <UNK> WARRANTIES OF ANY <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF <UNK> OR <UNK> FOR ANY <UNK> . 120.42348701908413
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " <UNK> you ! 10.918352938402993
Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 17.277467850454535
She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> . 15.845705526460003
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . 13.441831891726167
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 8.968626282376423
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 8.42853173945923
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ' s height , or rather <UNK> . " " How I long to see her again ! 13.21558634007778
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . 13.92529360466379
The other is Miss De Bourgh . 9.501214410952029
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you . 10.779696527980233
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . 14.401565622802256
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . 11.664646468983674
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <UNK> silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <UNK> between them again . 27.79100187980375
Elizabeth , after slightly <UNK> it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . 15.621261695627211
where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without <UNK> a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . 13.985654491864556
This is my advice . 6.452778828723086
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so doubtful , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea . 18.74737720828977
<UNK> such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 15.943548144787298
" This will not do , " said Elizabeth . 4.177476804644737
but no one can throw any blame on them . 11.415845120185852
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . 7.278005289611054
I am afraid you will be angry . " " My dearest sister , now be be serious . 9.145051041928411
If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 16.883713730233122
She will follow wherever Lydia leads . 18.026670296020335
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . " " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 10.461429366999724
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 13.245711509586954
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else ! 8.804376989666368
And now here ' s Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 12.684596343293586
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 18.627072069854055
Your ' s , c . " Mr . Darcy ' s letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last . 8.864652814251498
Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . 9.11590994248994
I cannot do justice to his kindness . 7.317395678850751
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she <UNK> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . " Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . 14.07646460040399
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . 16.74325921320715
Did you see it ? " Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . 8.562213308316073
With <UNK> tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of <UNK> that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . 17.306787467970377
But I must tell you how it went off . 8.702220827673141
But his pride , his abominable pride , his <UNK> avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in <UNK> , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . 18.615617695739815
" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . 16.05277924441609
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole <UNK> of <UNK> , as was here collected in one individual . 29.972637336913756
I will put on my things in a moment . 7.657563455271119
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 14.827612222015043
Lizzy <UNK> she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . " " And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems an hopeless business . " " <UNK> to Lizzy about it yourself . 12.163525826502237
She is not such a simpleton . 6.094924468303832
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 15.030169094167166
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little <UNK> by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . 20.365996830221206
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 18.88346180622843
CHAPTER I . 2.9571027967597594
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . 15.308852247478969
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . 8.537067686078494
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 12.160589966440382
She has two nieces of her own . 7.431084192706968
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ' s <UNK> had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or <UNK> in him . 16.247192983711635
She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 15.930639223238162
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . 10.793925931780116
I was never more <UNK> ! 9.218453283628522
And is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? 9.448532603815176
She had very little notice from any but him . 7.691158889020187
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . " " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose . 8.15844333501646
We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . 28.25554802379322
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . " " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . " Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . 23.455223921941776
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . 12.373770461338257
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . 19.205547107193965
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . 15.696196542692721
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it . 9.72503571903289
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . 12.671946510880865
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome . 18.81569063249459
mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to day ? 15.946039241008846
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . " Hunsford , near <UNK> , Kent , th <UNK> . DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . " There , Mrs . 22.61653563580706
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Are not you curious to hear how it was <UNK> ? " " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . " " La ! 12.735306572383129
She turned from sister to sister , <UNK> their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . 14.430091999634023
All Meryton seemed striving to <UNK> the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . 19.6066731725787
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 13.142080121177287
Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time . 14.397584092916707
Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 13.842006913625038
It is really too distressing . 9.269071599251589
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 15.86185446330912
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . " Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less <UNK> of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too <UNK> by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . 17.02832759078975
With the <UNK> concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 17.283753430777686
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . 10.610413629523313
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
I will read it to you " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles <UNK> to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <UNK> <UNK> . 18.88528827373413
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went <UNK> against the <UNK> ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <UNK> <UNK> , and give the praise where it was due . 22.007456214665932
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . 8.594142057552677
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character . 19.668998756394398
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . 12.606154940099769
" But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . " " <UNK> , headstrong girl ! 14.10839712036357
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . " " Not as you represent it . 10.006787367732455
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being <UNK> by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . 21.255537573628004
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 23.781935664248646
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned . 18.418175225965793
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . 20.59108072277599
I am sure my sisters must all envy me . 10.461227384153496
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London . 9.768266003151137
" Your affectionate friend , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " Oh ! 13.141037033110631
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 16.989694581377485
She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . 15.62747466852656
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her <UNK> being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 16.442718673148153
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <UNK> <UNK> on the probability of each statement but with little success . 25.560829167324485
She is almost three and twenty ! 10.234346422333378
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! 15.577031312232206
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better <UNK> room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . 20.348679274500274
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . 17.325915633094642
One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 17.406723441833844
Whatever bears affinity to <UNK> is <UNK> . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 23.841578459567064
Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley . 12.528993180478166
Make haste , and come down this moment . " Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . 23.157512685503377
<UNK> , teazing , man ! 10.148244366096758
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him . 8.117779215867582
Bennet ' s <UNK> was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter . 12.958169239054913
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to <UNK> , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to <UNK> his prosperous love . 27.893183478450016
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <UNK> , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her <UNK> and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , Lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . 18.093400928702486
" Good gracious ! " cried Mrs . 8.61397621982002
Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . 10.086428749064115
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with <UNK> and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as <UNK> an air as possible . " Mr . Bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . 30.09720511693693
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 11.236377912560611
You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs . 10.519079108219453
<UNK> as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . 15.959345170920537
<UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 14.55683360449075
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his <UNK> to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm . 17.521136935189414
Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . " Then addressing her daughter , " Oh ! 14.123191243617432
<UNK> away the letter immediately and <UNK> a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . " " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . 12.49802385931459
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . 17.27236928478866
Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 11.236874192949042
" Gracechurch street , <UNK> . 10.360488682013258
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 24.428009488331345
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should <UNK> . 13.458120202960348
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 12.588147691155331
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not <UNK> me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . 19.979014428768057
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> . 15.858163199721835
She studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . 29.686316264505525
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in <UNK> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " said Jane as she finished it . 15.091873679602235
One must speak a little , you know . 6.9939441809251015
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . 17.702852323540345
I write rather slowly . " " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! 13.518253037639138
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr . Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent . 14.518456331719193
Yet he knew to the contrary himself . 8.829985043999327
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . 17.315645152141297
" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs . 8.882708599289748
Believe her to be deceived by all means . 8.799352428537862
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 16.92800724347119
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . 19.819256559658886
Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately . 33.52388286683883
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of <UNK> them . 14.858558504743248
Not handsome enough to dance with ! 11.418231783261104
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . 9.833609562335207
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely . 10.346041857743332
Elizabeth silently attended her . 7.680756286848743
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard <UNK> in any of the family . 21.337072998543075
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the <UNK> road . 17.469264027604044
" I cannot see why Mrs . 6.114576167979078
On this subject , what can you have to say ? 7.926040753462493
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas . 34.15124352516981
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some <UNK> , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings . 16.94974159681681
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . 10.368465601177773
<UNK> , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . 12.079148788094713
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most . 9.109318579311248
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 13.033281883037688
Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . " In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . 10.82392695757228
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 10.519398957045265
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> . 9.352701664088274
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in <UNK> <UNK> to be her husband , might then have <UNK> in its proper place . 25.93906823261833
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the <UNK> kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . 13.888726612871602
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . 10.079761904479037
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . 14.143441457865661
But that is not the case here . 5.539906936990408
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and <UNK> , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <UNK> her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . 16.449409224641986
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . 17.105043415064475
If his own vanity , however , did not <UNK> him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . 11.951922053421326
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . 11.58279233578314
" He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 11.711939942354011
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious <UNK> , denoted a recollection of Jane , not <UNK> by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . 18.422685948218348
On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . 24.106113024272577
She was ashamed to think how much . 6.753239305540996
" A <UNK> ! " she cried . 8.25106587450922
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged <UNK> of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . 21.888770476697427
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . 10.518774628976844
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . 26.062151835682133
Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously . " Mrs . 16.25079134526759
Thank Heaven ! 12.51087044269883
are quite well . " " But you How are you ? " cried Elizabeth . 6.839163296969007
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton . 21.766791436763757
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . 8.604906338105
But slyness seems the fashion . 12.813381669084679
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . 15.425130452535567
In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <UNK> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 15.717108719819796
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . " " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . 14.539274334181087
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " This was invitation enough . 8.404434845919898
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . 15.275060537947533
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 8.889656027628739
This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . 15.834211879412317
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . " " I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which <UNK> in <UNK> a respectable man . 20.776864185727717
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 11.363452790192994
How could I be so silly as to wish it ! 8.155133914838933
But these things happen so often ! 16.054726100308738
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 19.613140395361263
My dear Mr . Bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? 7.0356354356354185
Her <UNK> wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . 24.897340259375436
But I will no longer <UNK> my young cousin . " Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his <UNK> at backgammon . 18.53431079054534
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . " " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . 16.473849407274685
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? " " Yes ; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . 22.722867148530508
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . " " But my father cannot . He wrote last week to hurry my return . " " Oh ! 15.00045016581327
GARDINER . " " Is it possible ! " cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . 8.742146362036314
why is not every body as happy ? " Elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . 15.895728148853419
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . 10.106000859076932
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . 14.00754546709042
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . 13.818174678085704
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 10.155497035325176
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly <UNK> at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 12.641198337491408
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 11.12208987086322
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . 9.873829982805331
Bennet . 2.1934480210742664
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 14.382574608123342
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . 14.27567926849612
Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a <UNK> over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was <UNK> Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <UNK> . 16.284960951944118
" I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 10.561130707079366
" Yes if Darcy does not put it off again . 10.171959226275353
Bennet and Mrs . 2.870700106654428
" Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . " She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . 17.54349034340239
The <UNK> of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . 17.941758395918505
He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 10.275408535475666
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
From that moment I observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 17.174506952303734
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . 7.438802204151716
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . 12.971001606056022
Every kind of pride must <UNK> from the connection . 16.022395490240672
It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> . 12.206572469980594
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to <UNK> such pleasures . 20.632731032179652
When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . " " Your plan is a good one , " replied Elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . 13.95851131040383
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . 9.224831094442612
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 21.34445439559271
" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? " " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . " " La ! " replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . 10.562406524588992
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . 10.071298068480715
CHAPTER I . 2.9571027967597594
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . 14.856052648181908
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 18.617426964279485
We were married , you know , at St . <UNK> ' s , because Wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish . 13.22672998637439
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . 8.159854900127064
Any other inconsistencies with modern <UNK> have been left as printed . 35.270479989221634
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest . 12.997882331370274
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . 9.161537770573068
It will pass away soon enough . " " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty . 13.642708859637668
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . 11.958061155925382
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . 11.195660084695435
" John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? " " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 12.717734119780776
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away . 9.091327817306706
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . 20.924430825798506
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . 14.172789453151504
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her <UNK> , by dwelling on them . 9.12980103292214
He still loves me , and we are engaged . " Jane looked at her <UNK> . 12.478108658567683
Let me never see either one or the other again ! " Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no <UNK> , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re <UNK> the admiration of her former lover . 24.26750468629804
Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a <UNK> chaise . " " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . 10.713315140944385
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 11.690803047545415
Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs . 17.420108985159356
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 10.824269892720444
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 16.430238392864695
Yes , yes . 4.48335822990137
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . 7.1095503640419935
The pause was to Elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . 8.755663796574208
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such <UNK> as these . 18.189309881503572
Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . 10.111409808437188
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas ' s last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the <UNK> were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three <UNK> <UNK> at least . 24.107698340738274
After walking several miles in a <UNK> manner , and too <UNK> to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their <UNK> , that it was time to be at home . 17.551982427308413
Do not let us quarrel about the past . 15.299143855044044
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . 10.824972119942757
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . " " Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . 18.133332221551687
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of <UNK> should not be broken in on . 14.801649076298634
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 11.93061123288448
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . 7.893751092600909
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . 13.086459167817349
" He seems to be a most <UNK> and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so <UNK> as to let him come to us again . " " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . " " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . " Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of <UNK> , marrying , and <UNK> his <UNK> whenever it were required . 19.65453244196827
I am perfectly satisfied . 6.064798487344782
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . 17.433061527093635
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " Darcy mentioned his letter . 8.878372599261192
" Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . 6.192064992427208
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 17.37005833811555
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . " " In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . 14.016901787772282
" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . " He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very <UNK> thing , and called out to her , " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr . Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain . 16.554689362498483
" Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 14.272342254921703
Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . 21.82761789766739
She will be taken good care of . 7.526930836193182
Though our kind uncle has done something towards <UNK> him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . 24.22238026020132

A little time therefore . I shall certainly try to get the better . " With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . " " My dear Jane ! " exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good . 14.009564135140138
I cannot quite agree with you there . 7.586331781498377
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . " " That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever heard you utter . 12.738379993209596
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 9.928479553084362
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 14.984825739294505
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . 16.18428720098765
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . 18.542014998801047
His character was to speak for itself . 8.561482661274125
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 17.134225394184163
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . 10.793596545151779
" She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . " Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . 15.275935339913243
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . 7.004082639728087
Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and <UNK> passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . 16.247096464230985
" But so we all do . 4.663563562335554
Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 9.048548500617764
It adds even another motive . 15.907948596073524
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 12.125048857345686
If a woman <UNK> her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . 17.428021087348082
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the <UNK> of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 16.05322785563583
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their <UNK> , <UNK> , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty ' s and Lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it . 16.361593863836838
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 17.533108087937173
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it . 8.817019535972184
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . 11.323149466398762
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 24.88288911885623
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 14.759286892675513
At night she opened her heart to Jane . 9.548820479820202
So much the better . 5.867121979899038
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <UNK> manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . 23.191412729434358
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 14.91274226153773
My watchfulness has been <UNK> ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I <UNK> in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance . 19.432533738297703
I thought I should have broke my heart . " " I am sure I shall break mine , " said Lydia . 10.757555363674127
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 24.904798328896405
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 13.962620677604084
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 15.384836568387124
" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . 5.697417671816339
At length the chaise arrived , the <UNK> were <UNK> on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . 19.032834534942612
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 12.229368867323048
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 13.838643871114918
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <UNK> . 18.711466190374335
On the following Monday , Mrs . 7.5522983177438325
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . 13.549699616367516
My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them . 18.187161312973377
Bennet by admiring Mrs . 7.308867310548672
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . 15.833018265021074
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing . 19.211080736797992
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty <UNK> , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . 28.3340058775204
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 15.817919095283882
Bennet very dull for several days . 12.153936159035867
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . 11.474833329453048
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . 13.357971739575577
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 12.993314849222756
" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . 11.523112714422624
Every body declared that he was the <UNK> young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always <UNK> the appearance of his goodness . 16.85807910103287
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . 13.35456990202885
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . 15.047735493505423
It <UNK> me . 7.943757018835744
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 28.719460043451853
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 20.390134391918192
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 8.760839507848525
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . 10.673960964745731
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 9.222502776142731
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 10.405836169186976
He was the <UNK> , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . 12.481658355300322
She was going to the <UNK> ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of <UNK> , just fit to be killed . " Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . 17.98491342618359
Miss Darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . 9.608172498700814
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
Never mind Miss Lizzy ' s hair . " " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . " " Oh ! 16.970866180178458
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . 26.116270804935706
" Yet why did he come ? " She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . 12.004398866980154
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 23.699234110866417
" When my eyes were opened to his real character . Oh ! 11.797697359115176
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . 8.788462143714028
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <UNK> of elegant nuptials , fine <UNK> , new carriages , and servants . 17.89008740863204
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all <UNK> , was still <UNK> <UNK> . 16.56805054211418
Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . 12.712971674798899
Bennet was <UNK> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and <UNK> in her <UNK> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the <UNK> happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 20.093919707009487
But I have other <UNK> . 7.675377895656243
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . 12.653566752206777
. 1.3860752889566952
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . 13.849061832427116
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . " He is now gone into the army , " she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . " Mrs . 14.104963396565367
Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . 17.76888845565555
what felicity ! 6.379521087930022
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough . 14.87596797813273
To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough . 11.470724650468043
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 13.85259813096214
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent . 10.223483872989332
Bennet . They had several children . 7.297526467330176
Has it not been <UNK> <UNK> by yourselves ? 32.33309619866001
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . 11.636040460479874
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as <UNK> <UNK> as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . 16.377650692500914
Many small donations to , are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the <UNK> . 38.31534065910143
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise . 34.24354454106165
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . 12.028023527657533
" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . 12.00887185504015
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . 8.889414646649664
. 1.3860752889566952
Had Elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . 21.25921981966504
The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . 10.970018759107122
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . 7.716681839113152
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 15.250843506968966
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! 14.292250875105129
He was my <UNK> , and excessively attached to me . 9.64085325844329
I was given good <UNK> , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 13.384753813080488
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . 10.202837996683233
They had long wished to see him . 7.035275882529467
I always had a value for him . 5.607373097219072
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . <UNK> are never of so much consequence to a father . 13.11407830995019
And it is the more to be <UNK> , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte <UNK> me , that this <UNK> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs . 14.552764325477854
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 16.134672558030104
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 9.48585064969141
" No ; but it must be done soon . " Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . 15.78704348618523
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . 18.268972855296024
Collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . 16.509706045681497
yes , " said Elizabeth drily " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a <UNK> deal of care of him . " " <UNK> of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care . 16.50640431578472
Lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . 11.368815383145531
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 19.947039401067368
She answered him with cold civility . 9.832755598406589
It will save me a world of trouble and economy . 12.71697055892504
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! 15.387453504869512
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 18.091329304165853
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . 7.001595399082322
For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently . 16.23454242326963
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . 19.397520018316065
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> . 29.50218225282739
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <UNK> by Wickham . 15.861493154435834
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . 15.178786958843284
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! 13.355192079114998
All was joy and kindness . 8.499014097171228
It was all pride and <UNK> . 8.329179416729234
" If they had uncles enough to <UNK> all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one <UNK> less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . 17.563324180713924
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . 15.610610738353191
In ran Mrs . 6.737815738769754
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 8.5179777814315
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . 22.232340455144584
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <UNK> . 13.174747225297903
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr . Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . 13.063213941031545
You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <UNK> is denied me , because you have always so much . " Mr . Bingley arrived . 14.594703228636625
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . 13.159544896851802
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . 9.262909684974941
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 32.74047580302834
Gardiner , though unknown . 5.769821366754246
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> . 24.658335696673202
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . 17.004559240958706
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . 13.007034025668638
Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night <UNK> and <UNK> gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty <UNK> away . " " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " " You go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds ! 19.382844700816282
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . " " You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . 13.049564549633677
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . 11.94055281987532
In Lydia ' s imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of <UNK> happiness . 22.014468584481182
I am prodigiously proud of him . 7.410232293820353
How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? " " That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . 13.867572802426684
Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? 17.212626237635156
Hurst were going out . 7.594027766910008
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self importance and humility . 22.217532542794054
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 13.882779640610591
<UNK> <UNK> the face of Mrs . 14.038302404618177
It was agreed to . 4.264009949884826
Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . 9.204213491829028
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam . 17.096345239309965
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 25.60174621277747
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 13.443776425962657
Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the <UNK> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . 20.094970025182214
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 8.597738225124163
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . 11.920584130401897
" But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with <UNK> , and rob it of a few <UNK> <UNK> without his perceiving me . " The period of expectation was now <UNK> . 19.835452113208813
There is a mixture of <UNK> and self importance in his letter , which promises well . 16.350203593498637
I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister . 19.28188265647837
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . 12.589497794144348
<UNK> and <UNK> support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg tm ' s <UNK> and <UNK> that the Project Gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come . 56.089955351894254
I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . " " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <UNK> of you . 14.714511816486338
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . 17.93310635317246
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . " Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . 14.578257240136496
how acutely did she now feel it . 10.293007726938187
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . 8.429994456638562
Do not distress me by the idea . 8.065657222551526
Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . 17.882161541473778
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? 16.455021072517003
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <UNK> with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 15.934680957547954
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 15.806602730581558
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 3.8516926834444503
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " " <UNK> do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 19.725872884959898
That is all settled . " " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . 10.000451047149262
He is a pleasant fellow , and would <UNK> you <UNK> . " " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 14.882882956817776
And , besides , no <UNK> of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then supposing them to be in London . 11.299219364251847
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 15.287580238604729
" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the <UNK> <UNK> above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <UNK> than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . 20.985610982926485
Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . 6.735872537463105
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . 11.2604729082492
You mentioned two instances . 11.30489902933415
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . 16.50436430434398
Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . 10.431501788548049
Mr . Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . 19.002815651362038
I have a high respect for your nerves . 9.740393895268172
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . 10.562899636733103
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . 21.63177117777326
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . 12.697185675458124

Now what have you to say ? " " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . " Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . 12.353548947413246
But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my <UNK> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . 21.43330795843444
Brighton , and a whole <UNK> of <UNK> , to us , who have been <UNK> already by one poor regiment of militia , and the <UNK> balls of Meryton . " " Now I have got some news for you , " said Lydia , as they sat down to table . 16.68105844250233
can it be really so ! 6.053214987118237
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . " " My beauty you had early <UNK> , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . 14.073064614476356
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . 14.260179535147861
Adieu to disappointment and <UNK> . 12.741766788768645
Oh , Lord ! 6.327274235349249
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . 11.142027865779307
that he had <UNK> his <UNK> in the first dance ! " " Oh ! 12.734771784043655
I rather wonder now at your knowing any . " " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " I never saw such a woman . 13.132153194928113
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . 13.357161032160947
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon <UNK> up every private care ; and covering her face with her <UNK> , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . 17.10103265644182
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . " " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . " " I beg your pardon . 7.933531958292001
Collins , you must send a servant with them . 7.081324463961664
is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must <UNK> us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . " Then shewing her purchases " <UNK> here , I have bought this bonnet . 21.39308463725473
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . 8.433498008133803
He has children of his own , and may have more . 6.22337798958
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an <UNK> on every subject . 14.332849449832366
But at length , by Elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that <UNK> which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the <UNK> . 16.721095354389632
Her ease and good spirits increased . 12.563470946017464
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 28.825166309681634
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 7.503264998512998
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company . 9.082350303977593
We seem to have been designed for each other . " Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she <UNK> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . 20.378285835031097
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . 18.597274865863337
The hill , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . 21.60402213464562
Bennet was most <UNK> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 15.971838194282842
Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by <UNK> to his sister . 12.83617757154059
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . " " I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your <UNK> what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . 15.578295811456277
She is unfortunately of a sickly <UNK> , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who <UNK> her education , and who still <UNK> with them . 22.495084466478605
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . 20.608840741303165
Good gracious ! 11.390417614673689
But you have chosen your fault well . I really cannot laugh at it . 12.605850291204838
How are you all ? " " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 14.71729069977103
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . 9.010536898267151
Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical . 16.63904227967607
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected . 11.62500378562036
Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her . 13.846676105216321
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . 29.42078518851808
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged . 18.50896819186213
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had . 11.64298603195412
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her . 8.382119953625669
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . 17.86173661561935
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 12.497335654932645
" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But now we may be silent . " " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " Sometimes . 23.068340606507235
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . 35.28996401704451
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 20.674962319183575
Her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . 17.96075919438173
A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone . 10.716513240089048
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? 10.302244988340316
oh ! 7.358159927180991
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must <UNK> him from such <UNK> misconduct as I have suffered by . 13.666861236140077
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . 14.601073654203018
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " " You may as well call it impertinence at once . 14.640291531427973
<UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . " " We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . " " But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs . 12.213693491522365
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the <UNK> , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <UNK> . 16.77626619829464
The <UNK> <UNK> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have . 18.344666076664506
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 13.94032584033943
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . 14.725805501239034
He has not an ill natured look . 10.993823709467641
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <UNK> her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 17.408787033190492
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled . " A gentleman and a stranger ! 12.79531785855543
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . 14.168812805259874
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . 6.902600630579568
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <UNK> . " " And this is your real opinion ! 13.914110195083946
You do not look well . 6.1872415844234565
She does not yet leave her dressing room . 11.53169189686381
She was overpowered by shame and vexation . 11.73820656657542
<UNK> has she condescended to give me her opinion <UNK> too ! on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our <UNK> at quadrille , while Mrs . 25.458139210642837
Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley <UNK> with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . 19.02518970751862

Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . 14.569641957449724
Does he know his real character ? " " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . 13.111525327627076
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before . 20.039605987309148
What are men to <UNK> and mountains ? 18.551212528672583
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction . 16.14029720699374
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . 8.727297387143086

" It certainly is a most <UNK> affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . 12.173457398925922
Not that I care about it , though . 6.320598491994348
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , <UNK> Lucases . 18.275828393083977
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . " Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . 23.022224987977346
" I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends . 8.184329751401632
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 16.933282494522313
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . " " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . " " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . 11.362353444493548
" They will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . 12.060368331027775
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth . 11.582676325581275
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 17.272029118690075
She dared not even mention that gentleman . 11.11886012644589
Gardiner . 2.6911073080185557
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional <UNK> in praise of his own humble abode , and the <UNK> it was receiving , he was happily employed <UNK> the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . 21.158952365782888
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . 14.974255372008999
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 13.758211852997691
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . 14.555552831768939
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater <UNK> than first <UNK> often boast ; and so <UNK> did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were <UNK> to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 20.81908927972406
For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . 14.333842162676643
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 15.370170971946797
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <UNK> recommendation , and to assert that I had <UNK> all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . 17.816562923822165
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley ' s <UNK> on fine eyes . 12.67516981192822
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . 14.144501174326097
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . 8.202594209542857
I will speak to her about it myself directly . 7.24437236619121
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 20.90270374303079
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
I hate such false friends . 10.564684202598738
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much <UNK> ; but when Mrs . 19.96683023142221
" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be <UNK> , for <UNK> I must call it . " " It is wonderful , " replied Wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 15.12234643405834
In a <UNK> voice Mrs . 12.077957763615753
Every thing <UNK> what is strong already . 20.660461219000453
" What will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are ! 8.080594138858112
Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party . 11.124144235115457
Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> . 20.013757157544262
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 11.065829301734853
We were always good friends ; and now we are better . " " True . 10.389969436855221
It is impossible that he should still love me . " After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on <UNK> their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water <UNK> , there <UNK> to be a little alteration . 23.887741289104746
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was <UNK> for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . 20.5775334448183
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 15.373773348498428
From what can it proceed ? 12.383371406673165
" You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . 10.610936032883114
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . 14.214496360426677
She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 20.16293996895447
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my <UNK> from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . 26.046631080537672
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . 9.292233636521889
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word . 12.93159533998726
I am sure you must feel it so . " " Oh ! 6.853749197307464
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 12.749554421220328
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! 10.886441955363937
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . 16.8922367754267
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . 14.319433844194048
And it was settled that we should all be there by <UNK> o ' clock . 17.016626455811917
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very <UNK> reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to <UNK> and <UNK> to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 17.97215893511881
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ' s performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste . 24.35950226180521
" You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 9.563285859636522
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <UNK> , readily obeyed . 17.309977023958425
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . 20.691711554089313
This letter is from Mr . Collins . " " From Mr . Collins ! 6.90405499143209
Bennet with civil self command to Miss Lucas . 12.925620599786297
Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent <UNK> and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . " Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " You cannot have a right to such very strong <UNK> attachment . 18.674519653788174
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 10.228484842184734
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 10.155853081816556
How he lived I know not . 6.427029513604229
It was unpardonable . 5.446511272220914
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter . 17.66570524650299
Collins and myself sincerely <UNK> with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the <UNK> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 18.290808801604864
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . 13.037468836837498
I congratulate her . 3.871148186208266
<UNK> my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . 15.92630351629922
I am sure you will be very comfortable there . 7.744894946746168
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Not all that Mrs . 4.728942326733068
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? 11.361247705693858
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . 11.498251181875663
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <UNK> to that evening , " said Elizabeth . 12.368961604144037
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . " " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were <UNK> and insolent . 12.58949429604563
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . 3.9523975759987184
" You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . " " I should be sorry indeed , if it were . 9.476757782502611
Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend . 8.0178685297446
Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 9.515672044192875
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <UNK> , but Mrs . 9.168336652328817
" Oh ! 3.731104652284054
<UNK> may sometimes be purchased too dearly . 27.95069036830713
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <UNK> by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . 18.56251926719319
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . 25.432696367125132
But Mrs . 3.0238131918448725
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . 10.30892665042752
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 13.65578935486454
. <UNK> . The copyright laws of the place where you are located also <UNK> what you can do with this work . 22.006997236824265
intending to trace their route . 14.16479384594834
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs . 12.876657512749938
They were hopeless of remedy . 10.343109981995799
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " There can be no doubt of that . 11.042730512630435
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 13.202932984689502
. F . . F . . Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees <UNK> considerable effort to <UNK> , do copyright research on , <UNK> and <UNK> public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg tm collection . 43.273925679276935
They were ignorant , idle , and vain . 7.911977486414612
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 23.866319301487938
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . " Mrs . 11.887437548471015
Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her . 10.46289094350958
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . 9.397956581852446
At present we have nothing to guide us . 12.710857566194484
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 27.3823330710688
She longed to see Mrs . 6.469403917571576
When I last saw her , she was not very promising . 6.947893841343892
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in <UNK> ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs . 20.294942839428863
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 15.968235867189232
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . 10.24964621582877
But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . 19.310331526099556
This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham . 18.50706373996077
Her ladyship was highly incensed . 13.502269735935508
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 20.294048855140556
" Of a fine , stout , <UNK> love it may . 12.752985774705603
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 13.17354796331656
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself . 20.763072375321844
Elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 17.608914572735134
" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . 6.498036677736208
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 12.937495240256384
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . 19.32649769411609
" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself . 11.84022026434084
Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn . 11.457907689239345
Section . 4.064776368428645
Their fortune on both sides is splendid . 19.25287326166687
She saw with the <UNK> eye of fancy , the <UNK> of that gay bathing place covered with officers . 26.83742430970262
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 11.749229143130556
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . 13.73402346415951
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 8.61065947172339
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long . 14.582329536630796
Every thing that is charming ! 10.163984450201998
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . 15.859664138775782
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . 18.91714272850743
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ' s way . " Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <UNK> . 16.632068504900868
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . " " Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . " " And do you like her ? " " Very much . " " I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . 10.589469017462482
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . 5.2957604952382695
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 10.28129604727837

I would keep a pack of <UNK> , and drink a bottle of wine every day . " " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . 16.734516437211425
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . 9.385724098440281
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the <UNK> . 21.27942847895226
The next was in these words . 7.583752462066989
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . 9.172520399948764
You supposed more than really existed . 13.719219930709933
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <UNK> at the <UNK> of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time <UNK> her natural degree of sense , since the <UNK> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be <UNK> , was likely to be <UNK> in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a <UNK> place and a camp . 31.501577467074508
The <UNK> <UNK> of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in <UNK> with her opinion of each . 19.9367699708196
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 12.690344021959069
What are we to do ! " would they often <UNK> in the bitterness of <UNK> . 14.897476077285322
My temper I dare not vouch for . It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world . 17.329017541670947
If you ' <UNK> believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 15.385193375683093
" But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing . 8.602124180321777
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 16.279010548497244
So near a <UNK> to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart . 18.856412415871347
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ? 9.3634605984218
But in what <UNK> it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . 14.930375799659636
Hart was the <UNK> of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone . 25.42326621227989
Perhaps he thought her too young . 7.810131424434135
If I were not afraid of judging <UNK> , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . 14.905548432073218
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in <UNK> to the proposal before him . 10.533199712821803
They had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister . 12.022688263589266
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " As Mrs . 11.422638326896257
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . 12.18115839881756
Three daughters married ! 14.48824403687399
<UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . 12.262165640319857
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 10.35853647452022
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . 7.816799911925977
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 15.067470591356885
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . 14.244586721240704
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . 17.926418718847437
Poor Charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . 17.69048800329686
And one of my own daughters . 6.350374742941685
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . " To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . 20.01836150487248
The day of his and Lydia ' s departure soon came , and Mrs . 7.507987778871415
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . " " <UNK> out , " said Mrs . 7.9988495691759995
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy ' s meditated elopement . 17.02597121636865
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done . 13.897893472403267
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however <UNK> its existence might prove , had at least <UNK> one day . 21.71773684272384
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 14.094993469881926
With them he is remarkably agreeable . " " I do not believe a word of it , my dear . 7.851823027127285
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " cried Elizabeth . 19.838279877626764
I know we dine with four and twenty families . " Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could <UNK> Bingley to keep his countenance . 19.74514856432689
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 5.922173403221805
There is nothing he would not do for her . " The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . 13.15867594597949
It must be an amusing study . " " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing . 18.050522864819033
The supposition did not pain her . 8.589470082069498
But she would not be secure . 5.432795366873666
I send no compliments to your mother . 8.052946688091488
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? 13.070584063509646
" I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . 22.871368127546805
<UNK> that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . 10.466263543115994
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of <UNK> for them . 17.020708647958585
Her mother <UNK> <UNK> , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 23.969502386828395
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus <UNK> my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to <UNK> your authority in my behalf . 20.782911159360122
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . " The wedding took place ; the bride and <UNK> set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . 15.531024837854615
Such a countenance , such manners ! 9.34311602118861
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " With such kind of <UNK> of their parties and good <UNK> , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . 20.338839158870567
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . 15.358390829525579
But I must write no more . 6.21274072896167
Are the <UNK> of Pemberley to be thus <UNK> ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . 16.656424565300274
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , <UNK> to invite him to sit by herself . 19.501595682105382
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . 12.426517898182162
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . 16.712683262909035
At length however Mrs . 8.327904181521614
Mr . Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . 9.197544014199211
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . 16.622504887638094
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall <UNK> a list , according to his information . 21.56143994519162
But will they make you happy ? " " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " <UNK> at all . 11.305008403747735
Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 12.41538881759749
how shall I bear so much happiness ! " She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty . 18.757524058040307
The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 16.807540456093264
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . 17.635793332964976
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 21.198679463334642
My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . 12.280167631000863
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . 16.08001017578584
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . 7.947495215333975
I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . " " You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr . Darcy . " " No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ' s connections . 12.297180235196628
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Well , much good may it do them ! 7.9379866953322376
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so <UNK> to you . 22.406407862500117
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 10.518008227727739
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 11.275817368551795
" Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " for Mrs . 5.049472256562378
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . 22.215312371786652
Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . 7.915406230457854
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the <UNK> Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . 13.943763010363925
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . 7.454966590881383
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth ! 12.126174458363172
His brother in law , Mr . Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr . Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble <UNK> ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . 19.7360232742562
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 15.015931876158543
But that is nothing to us . 4.544071538254652
Elizabeth immediately began playing again . 11.186335157519595
<UNK> Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . " " If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . " " She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . 15.442914449361464
My father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . 15.99409512720192
But there are two things that I want very much to know one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . " " <UNK> ! 13.814146215945254
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the <UNK> , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 14.474597080564335
" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! 11.672126243586339
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . 12.148219301089554
" Yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally <UNK> , without raising all this <UNK> ! 18.308960519183664
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her . 9.574084530807179
Hill began instantly to express her joy . 14.524752581403066
It would have suited me in every respect . " " How should you have liked making sermons ? " " <UNK> well . 16.52263477055163
Your <UNK> makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a <UNK> . " " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! 23.18385149529752
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious . 20.241332273956438
yes ; there is nothing in that . 5.751450991608595
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . 15.376136407379352
See paragraph . C below . 20.821011739966345
They are gone off together from Brighton . 13.350956449412969
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 16.685586704209623
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . 4.884397213656614
There ' s for you ! 5.539457257105862
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 13.914126585327415
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . 11.854352226689116
What will Wickham say ? 8.339284113682263
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 16.75361989258103
I had not an idea of it . " Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . 9.07639639935002
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . " " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . " " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " I am not . " Lady Catherine seemed pleased . 13.003988311007133
If she does not object to it , why should we ? " " Her not objecting , does not justify him . 11.137533254809213
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 17.97153122573261
CHAPTER III . 6.996859120965737
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . 6.279399102080235
They agreed that Mrs . 6.193515292625366
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever . 9.507730672375715
I am impatient to see him . " " In point of <UNK> , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective . 11.582744645210699
Mr . Darcy ! 3.20224654476881
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 17.293335538989776
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for <UNK> Lodge , the <UNK> are dreadful . " Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . 18.583871927611593
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she . 5.7867661126523435
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . 4.986050682672554
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . 15.327872928867862
I . 1.6094609822015138
CHAPTER <UNK> . 8.805540922633503
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . 12.414482599132437
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other . 10.489293155190861
It is too long ago . 7.981140251491784
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . 17.32358583148624
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a <UNK> situation , and always spending more than they ought . 20.061951415010633
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . 9.868690178479092
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . 12.860429152520217
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard . 19.593553300575334
Why must their marriage be private ? 13.601411025428959
Are you going much farther ? " " No , I should have turned in a moment . " And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together . 13.63437988901971
good or bad ? " " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . 12.5405503749702
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a <UNK> denial , and ride off as fast as I could . " " Would Mr . Darcy then consider the <UNK> of your original intention as <UNK> for by your obstinacy in <UNK> to it ? " " Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . " " You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . 21.185763776969097
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . 16.497382246555073
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 9.669887224101887
If the <UNK> of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . 18.219440357713562
But do not imagine that he is always here so often . 9.531110535753946
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 21.61507399404038
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . 22.76270172374847
To the civil enquiries which then <UNK> in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer . 14.518742612334202
Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . 9.12085628477658
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 11.815952694449779
He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable house . 10.813018204685923
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . 14.950180316604182
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 13.363292791144744
Gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , <UNK> of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 14.461479428265706
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> . 26.610937647564988
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . 7.908489067887338
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger <UNK> than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance <UNK> and <UNK> . 16.340952305256256
" This is wholly unexpected . 8.37193582304189
Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him . 9.167863685537585
Is this to be endured ! 9.270424411717915
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . 11.598673506636779
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . 7.300667861256221
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! 13.473721073153937
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 11.674746206176716
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . 19.736643346035198
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <UNK> shewn . 22.262939423940818
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to <UNK> her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever <UNK> . 16.77435213857562
But here , by carrying with me one <UNK> source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <UNK> . 21.259339233671177
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 8.69332204875242
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 13.173073292490328
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 11.640561617576745
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 10.599022786820889
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . " " Good <UNK> ! " cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? How could his will be <UNK> ? Why did not you seek legal <UNK> ? " " There was just such an <UNK> in the terms of the <UNK> as to give me no hope from law . 20.702708787159384
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! 16.722028566289104
Their powers of conversation were considerable . 12.93857353046665
I dearly love a laugh . " " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . 8.757380884063993
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 22.47810596352484
Kitty <UNK> and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . 13.471767826725298
His words seemed to <UNK> it . 11.954283978046133
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 12.504920553863126
This was very amiable , but Charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . 17.723352869808984
Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt . 9.715660674351325
As for your Elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what <UNK> could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye <UNK> , so remarkably fine , might be copied . " At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . 17.335104555076825
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . 16.80156447906008
Bennet , " to walk to <UNK> Mount this morning . 10.289498507733319
Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ' s arm <UNK> to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s . 14.954762251373113
Let us hope for better things . 11.52896917375502
" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides <UNK> tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! " Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . 23.922678560010297
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 13.579829113232634
Mr . Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . 10.503107997741468
Is nothing due to me on that score ? 14.2513520678834
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . 19.008707698587582
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . 23.529754772097093
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 14.912348094317087
Had his character been known , this could not have happened . 9.252461254968905
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 13.15996361040703
As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . 10.734875954168151
A lively imagination soon settled it all . 14.840376585679373
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not . 12.474604113549514
His doing so drew her notice . 11.529490977362867
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling . " " Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose . 11.7436257945078
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . 14.352083358290521
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . 20.360197649187775
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 20.25008535642608
<UNK> it be so ? " " Oh , lord ! 10.032280997906819
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . 13.93569778862385
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . 11.576197135036598
Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . 11.200067607549158
" I cannot make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by <UNK> for being next in the entail ? We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " No , my dear ; I think not . 15.471614647004513
Let me mend it for you . 7.640219677240971
A most delightful place ! <UNK> Parsonage House ! 39.07963096667337
" I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . " " Who do you mean , my dear ? 10.65054403429762
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . 7.133287971114329
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 13.464760414807502
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . 12.294833301321756
Gardiner smiled . 5.440025903906548
I have not that pain . 3.880772891695545
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . 16.721915085703277
Lady Catherine ' s great attentions to Mrs . 8.09619318383206
It was at Sir William Lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . 13.882133908571276
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . 17.007324428601585
You must contrive to send somebody . 13.388488836856446
He cannot know what Mr . Darcy is . " " <UNK> not ; but Mr . Darcy can please where he chuses . 10.55655030076409
He has heartily <UNK> me now . " Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . 20.877921331675072
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . 13.85500309413525
Its business office is located at North <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , . 61.43575719837675
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 16.455033978606235
<UNK> he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 10.809354236855865
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . 25.438709535705023
CHAPTER XIX . 7.2234956205320096
He drew a chair near her . 10.133174766867652
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . 14.717367604627205
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 6.316080912283525
I came to try you . 4.850838145352412
She continued in very <UNK> reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 20.610560995520597
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due . " " My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . 15.86583911269982
This information , however , startled Mrs . 8.522684861282421
But of course she did not mention my name to you . " " Yes , she did . " " And what did she say ? " " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well . 9.437880926381185
It was the last of the regiment ' s stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were <UNK> <UNK> . 12.461416501074808
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object . 10.91716754664639
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over <UNK> evils , or <UNK> them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . 20.269859287724813
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . 15.524258398355666
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? " " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . 13.096854495759105
Mr . and Mrs . 2.334144763093918
How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . 11.278539396403483
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater <UNK> concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being <UNK> by <UNK> , <UNK> inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . 31.66759322916816
" I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . " " Perhaps I do . 8.168440529052997
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . 15.224378174379927
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
You may have drawn him in . " " If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . " " Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? 7.766933241714859
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 18.980153587014836
The <UNK> or <UNK> of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining <UNK> . 35.26290158666507
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 15.811301526518088
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 13.14536652615848
" Upon my word , " said Mrs . 5.535403733587921
Who should suffer but myself ? 14.792039124964184
" You forget that I have made no answer . 7.415829147028164
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . " " What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? 13.638942704798252
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 14.585419933563774
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . 12.375589194110674
Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . 9.679127537346224
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . 11.42970187673827
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . 17.642492804997083
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 7.246377569918905
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . 12.453650207661548
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been <UNK> from the world , in some distant farm house . 15.571142807527021
" You write uncommonly fast . " " You are mistaken . 10.732289743227847
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw . 6.6365466250834295
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . 14.772692489290275
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 20.065376463897728
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 20.984172800664357
Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age . 15.165606825040019
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 14.922367080189645
There was also a <UNK> of one thousand pounds . 14.886858427607068
It must be his own doing . He is his own master . 8.92722365985281
Information about the <UNK> of Project Gutenberg tm Project Gutenberg tm is <UNK> with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including <UNK> , old , middle <UNK> and new computers . 62.37165452803547
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . 9.934693842318133
We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 11.57737797005012
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 17.205980023739247
I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 14.063141619259149
" It must not be thought of . 4.078734353779663
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . 12.73841616748278
But there was still something <UNK> behind , of which prudence <UNK> the <UNK> . 25.77291261565421
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry . 11.93618943891149
My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . 13.5472434977437
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . 16.018477034287667
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 11.593890116787582
Gardiner ' s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are <UNK> against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 20.069378225713915
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . 19.80243202287557
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 16.380815756790025
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . 16.874375278271707
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an <UNK> man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a <UNK> , had nothing to say to her . 14.227539239540508
I am so pleased so happy . 6.481206212404336
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . " Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . 8.793019840416237
Every thing , however , went on <UNK> , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ' s first sketch . 17.546518319613224
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings . 16.208643551180646
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with <UNK> civility , " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ? 16.48008681663545
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . 11.472838234794647
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <UNK> satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 24.81003116253373
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to <UNK> him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <UNK> of your understanding , but <UNK> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <UNK> , and those which <UNK> the <UNK> ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the <UNK> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 22.750113493323855
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 17.824922417898527
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh ! 11.356225087250747
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . 8.68746029033016
I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . 12.41806885146161
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . 10.206824466281901
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and <UNK> , and talk and laugh all the way home . 15.067181022855541
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . 20.39628756890972
Bennet . 2.1934480210742664
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 16.881445219967986
<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 11.593071357708412
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her . 13.3140563077447
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . 14.825117972797232
What are you telling Miss Bennet ? 11.373624627924743
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . 13.045782436593965
It was a rational scheme to be sure ! 9.330000446824066
His disposition must be dreadful . " " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . " Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from <UNK> , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! " " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; <UNK> of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same <UNK> care . 16.874837432780048
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . 10.891549227046427
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
I do not know who is good enough for him . " Mr . and Mrs . 5.275521452211162
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . 7.900693262995258
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they <UNK> with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy . 15.263742173238121
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . <UNK> staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . 20.51045565233461
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . 17.8474599632036
He replied , and was again silent . 5.3835633854701115
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . 6.149618397466474
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . 10.716357594472667
The second began . 6.6392690746462995
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I <UNK> believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . 19.018591204505892
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . " " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! 13.583109206938994
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . 6.564751950666495
Bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . 10.613157310824965
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 10.722067654846795
Well , but now for my news it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? 10.758643915040969
She directly replied , " You need not be frightened . 9.778303938136673
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . 9.380744870531776
You know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . 12.421744398772304
" <UNK> . 4.939170278062311
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . 11.888251713634704
He <UNK> how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an <UNK> manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there . 18.685958257139486
Elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . 15.949910002884401
Forster , the delight of Mrs . 4.382517717614065
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . " He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 20.632125911539667
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back . 12.133165460378123
What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . 8.598814173384529
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . 15.130246254575626
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . 18.56899777449921
" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . 14.135359117667894
how he must have felt it ! " " I never saw any one so shocked . 9.158168340566501
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to <UNK> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . 25.919247129590097
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 18.67970956326097
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before . 10.958518078695475
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her <UNK> of Mrs . 10.95503791047633
This will never do . " " You need not distress yourself . 9.842280770650937
Bennet thus began the <UNK> conversation . " Oh ! 13.795616978878309
Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . 14.45601829169366
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 20.62561115799493
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? " " One of them does . " " Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . 20.422732217659128
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley . 10.904466350575904
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 10.940853481194425
Bennet . 2.1934480210742664
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 11.096642414880153
You have employed your time much better . 10.000435670972685
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . " While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much <UNK> to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s . 21.336738256084644
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 14.846861217956551
I depend on you for that . " To these high <UNK> expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the <UNK> of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . 14.734318129496923
The possibility of Mr . Collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins ! 18.195211597220485
His temptation is not <UNK> to the risk . " " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment . 14.560922828719775
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . 13.818128954073227

I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking . 12.302907479516819
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 18.00739164609172
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 10.568561084130618
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 16.75648271282521
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . 23.048695059109782
There was another reason too for her opposition . 11.5916571459323
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 17.85601973084935
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . 15.942075835103289
and it was not wholly without foundation . 7.1000988854009215
It was not all settled before Monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . 10.17893334810694
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away . 14.383585720078738
" While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr . Bingley . " " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife . 9.353293122078743
" Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? 10.05439028544209
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs . 7.906056199045147
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <UNK> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . 22.59900640139864
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . 19.370861583170573
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . 10.76174849701817
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <UNK> than to herself . 13.94995925464128
But I have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous <UNK> , boy in the world . " Elizabeth almost stared at her . " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she . 16.630069492963088
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him . 11.809454735999637
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . 8.448542679120063
Can I speak <UNK> ? 16.63012287027413
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . 9.765089346284274

Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Mr . Collins began . 8.832789772441789
" Oh , yes ! if one could but go to Brighton ! 10.066923107311837
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . <UNK> immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . " " What is his name ? " " Bingley . " " Is he married or single ? " " Oh ! 15.725098482237401
That his anger could be carried to such a point of <UNK> resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem <UNK> , exceeded all that she could believe possible . 22.27402517784489

Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 15.138409292129172

<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 14.667236406984827
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . " " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth <UNK> ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy ' s steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself . " " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a <UNK> . 14.976768750148947
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . 12.702406086885874
" And pray may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a <UNK> tone , " Is it in address that he improves ? 17.979003275053543

A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 15.922169600566583
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . 19.55948141751832
<UNK> , wretched , mistake ! " Darcy made no answer . 12.693540754788623
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time . 21.740230169624986
Lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 22.206589957205917
With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were <UNK> understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged . 18.073143912809027

I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 8.236090755399726
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . " Mr . Bingley followed his advice . 13.664601861804185
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity . 24.468664116080507
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . But good lord ! 12.092476414747855

" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 11.342523825514156
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 18.021914388715704
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . 9.870010363025933
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . 14.14495562677911

But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . " " I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton .

They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . 10.596505052798417
" You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . 10.924928869814165
Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , <UNK> that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ? 15.12390537546747

Not these two or three years perhaps . " " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can . 12.075944685704147
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? 12.540880331688623
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . " " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? " " Dearest Jane ! 17.08760973980814
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much . 14.308473197054546
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 17.06467632632093

My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? 11.338535673376024
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . 16.583062187109867
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 10.176547077909538
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 15.118580847307483
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . 15.64017725488693

What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a <UNK> of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . " " Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . " " And what arts did he use to separate them ? " " He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling . 19.29840791236562

She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 10.70224888768189

" " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . 17.731952617143186

But I confess they would have no charms for me . 9.745177355570998
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 14.47061936510671
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 10.273816516435271
When the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a <UNK> to her mother ' s <UNK> for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . 20.40473578785752

Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 11.038441833823857
She was humbled , she was grieved ; she <UNK> , though she hardly knew of what . 10.785143237454308
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . 12.234626047901802
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . 13.673941004674914
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . " Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative . 8.42191807017512

I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him . 6.817322648050522
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . " And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr . Collins thus addressed her , " When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from <UNK> you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . " " <UNK> , Mr . Collins , " cried Elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly . 17.95560874139174
Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began . 20.13936276759424
" Of music ! 8.821421162040778
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 11.379986075412097
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . 19.464713431512283
" There is nothing the matter with me . 6.075469698469795
Give me farther particulars . 13.266633639890928
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . 18.569356303160415
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . " " Ah ! 16.23537008738085
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were <UNK> the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . 18.39448304278491
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . 19.92222743472383
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 12.800172570042415
" Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our <UNK> way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . " Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and <UNK> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 13.6105424976411
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 14.125184186788974
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 25.998736480513422
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 18.55785454175233
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs . 7.530338332331576
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . 9.902659213613116
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well . 15.499619574216341
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . " " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . " Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . 16.34250620466587
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 12.682230611004027
Her performance on the piano forte is <UNK> . " " It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . " " All young ladies accomplished ! 15.855841407528946
Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ? 19.397662121747928
If your feelings are still what they were last <UNK> , tell me so at once . 15.99192992467131
Collins ' s <UNK> of meat were too large for her family . 14.69542193916144
By tea time however the <UNK> had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . 16.20076883519084
I only hope they may have half my good luck . 11.554413657283927
The <UNK> pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . 15.829035131608094
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so <UNK> courted you . 21.63993763216508
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . " She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . 15.921908870653558
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . 6.82064556606911
" Yours , c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . 12.61992011866256
At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s <UNK> him entirely , for she was a most determined <UNK> ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making <UNK> and exclaiming after <UNK> , to have attention for any one in particular . 31.090772848868806
Mr . Wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a <UNK> as she could . 14.278684349033012
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . 12.028275715365238
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . 14.873503054152437
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative . 10.807549281590004
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go . 6.040428085673063
She felt <UNK> the justice of Mr . Darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 13.949514898853703
" While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . 11.034765363981508
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly <UNK> , she seated herself . 20.55660090735294
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 15.382426140519597
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . 11.459174436398863
Lydia , my love , ring the bell . 7.568753458209957
I shall like it of all things . 5.841552212947562
Georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . 21.086503935327322
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 17.319450686935152
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . 17.363018767250367
" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . 3.887523044458151
" There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London . 17.508512547457297
Not like the wild young men now a days , who think of nothing but themselves . 14.563782154554433
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 17.090945834446647
You are not well enough ; you cannot go yourself . " Elizabeth hesitated , but her <UNK> <UNK> under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . 17.578735459326182
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . 11.169637003466901
Bennet said only , " <UNK> , nonsense ! " " What can be the meaning of that <UNK> exclamation ? " cried he . 13.587841027983211
Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . " " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK> accordingly . " " You did ! 12.845169171860963
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . 13.786660581653283
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . " " Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> . 27.015211847487794
But that is one great difference between us . 10.590433779322126
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . " " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . " " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . 11.739773698793364
You refuse to <UNK> the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . 12.89053182597395
If he had been <UNK> before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity <UNK> could make him . 16.67962743427346
How I long to see her ! 6.074272811030837
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and <UNK> pass away . 31.565952396185775
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great <UNK> . 10.310231868944228
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . 15.473494823228268
Bennet and the children . 3.6001389361458473
You alluded to something else . 9.222985281256818
They saw him often , and to his other <UNK> was now added that of general <UNK> . 13.26978219618174
His surprise was great . 6.320866851881054
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 13.196475630317268
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that <UNK> is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . 15.349240953143388
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? 18.27263491068365
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . " " Oh ! 11.139120003515869
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 9.63077799128196
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . 10.559304377876481

The path just admitted three . 16.43382611392814
Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . 10.71978197555038
But , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 13.750655683215328
Miss Bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . 10.737850956435217
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . 8.075257818341408
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . 4.773071938723997
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 17.065823414284377
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to <UNK> her confidence in it . 14.333563963238566
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . 15.830413280940236
They will take care not to <UNK> their income . 15.638569131969835
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 29.72890206496301
Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . 12.168866483913536
They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . 11.679536721328299
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . 13.173356122452613
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 9.314932101901313
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable . 11.624737256613193
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . " " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . " " Pride , " observed Mary , who <UNK> herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe . 13.777232305319012
About the <UNK> , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . " Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings . 20.329665126842706
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph . 17.23938737799539
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . " " I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a kingdom ! 10.112400323677592
CHAPTER XII . 7.2234956205320096
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 12.743037224324839
The hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . 16.1944284663791
He had to be sure done much . 5.617092449942723
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 18.611764105552716
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 5.936133449565725
They walked on , without knowing in what direction . 10.230798135736157
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . 10.995944191741666
You <UNK> me for coming ? " " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you . 16.423390708943533
Oh , Lizzy ! 4.762886048536648
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost . 11.840070965886481
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her . 16.113848828506434
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! 10.890751662224355
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 11.59811438439732
So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 18.387370804185085
Bennet , who assured him with some <UNK> that they were very well able to keep a good <UNK> , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <UNK> . 14.092024650842397
This is your <UNK> resolve ! 20.708459273663493
<UNK> Lady Catherine as well as you can . 10.884941916692608
A clear ten thousand per annum . 33.951655455812485
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . " " That is his notion of christian forgiveness ! 20.24664234411265
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 21.48975056851809
no , no , this is not likely . 4.0566246071257455
" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam . 11.059007857008991
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . " " And I certainly never shall give it . 10.788552192535587
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 14.6299569470661
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 13.058707678659719
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 12.4157836608933
I always said it must be so , at last . 5.2194878583661435
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 4.997957383138639
Their manners are not equal to his . " " Certainly not ; at first . 8.102502521794875
But who was your mother ? 6.5105629679091015
" Lizzy , you must not do so . 4.091877505628336
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , soon collected them round the table . 20.603278411620476
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 11.729367031869588
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother . 9.429223421533848
" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? " Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . 24.26750302672164
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much . 8.00824612462532
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 15.724002364362873
It was only said , ' <UNK> , George Wickham , <UNK> . 11.76543165439188
When they repaired to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 12.929965036747076

It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . 9.778463529025457
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 17.521528774653298
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the <UNK> old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . 15.083538594067088
" Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say . 6.194732582207023
His apparent partiality had <UNK> , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . 16.712582823253268
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . 15.809168287630861
" You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . 13.393946700771085
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . " Mrs . 10.669291328353445
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . 6.674465865763691
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 17.051721206382354

But Georgiana would not join her . 7.513995541607879
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity . 23.206342088588965
" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of <UNK> in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ' s regard for me . 15.37757120206408
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . 11.602080498918204
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 6.489521605633627
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 12.864183798220177
We passed each other several times . 16.386425908921375
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 8.284551492771952
On Saturday he came again . 9.754614406287088
Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 9.054700548567661
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them . 9.238947941229188
I think I have heard you say that you know them . " " I know them a little . 5.966109596685342
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . 11.243337020366049
She could not <UNK> him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . 10.110795260636317
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing room . 14.550575102685032
I will try again . 5.703995163146664
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly <UNK> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . 20.981127398544785
They must have seen them together for ever . " " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . 15.511153829217628
It was gratitude . <UNK> , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <UNK> and <UNK> of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 22.166259651875055
Bennet ' s <UNK> looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . 25.779116273439158
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ' s character . " Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " <UNK> there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 18.336542716841056
Sir William did not say much . 8.160838455605589
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr . Darcy . " She then sought her eldest sister , who had <UNK> to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . 15.028620099770011
CHAPTER I . 2.9571027967597594
I will answer for it he never cared three <UNK> about her . 14.027067433953
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , <UNK> love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means <UNK> , though it could not be exactly defined . 16.267165289941563
She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . 19.314095307740967
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 15.982022449148078
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so <UNK> that I cannot answer for being <UNK> . 18.308564253847088
Pray forgive me , if I have been very <UNK> , or at least do not punish me so far , as to <UNK> me from <UNK> . 19.24747973209253
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . 10.520172707235627
She had no fear of its <UNK> farther , through his means . 14.326601860246754
The children have been wanting me this half hour . 14.401382329216839
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . 15.487681484083787
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 10.0407463595647
But I dare not hope it . 5.349771155742855
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone . 20.80175493495133
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does . 9.357714148979202
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . 16.9708198991311
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 14.816063334844616
" <UNK> he will not leave London before he has found them . 12.64500247598409
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 4.592736434626015
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 10.740250761069959
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their <UNK> concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 16.511313735765437
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 12.977540633417723
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . 18.085804425013215
The party did not supply much conversation . 11.327407103584619
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . " CHAPTER VI . 13.966497730376732
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , glancing at her sister and Bingley , shall take place . 15.75878964618267
" I am all astonishment . 4.258398243169042
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 14.00850688558255
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . 17.568585462241103
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 13.608960345613564
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . 15.7064136650888
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . 17.79155404819498
<UNK> the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it cannot be long . " He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . 18.828952408066336
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees . 15.577073504088057
Other schemes too came into her head . 18.216524202793686
If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 11.972553764803996
III . 4.395989708325061
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . 17.581329611733373
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . 22.398595088671733
Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . " " To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart . 14.959027278450396
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 12.83355227799846
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement . 23.564533786336263
The first week of their return was soon gone . 9.895352465298856
Bennet ' s civilities . 5.974468980590667
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 11.3063566904371
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as <UNK> , were in very good time . 16.936902807807865
I know no harm of her . " " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her <UNK> ' s death made her mistress of this fortune . " " No why should he ? 13.637802317845306
" I should never have said Mrs . 4.617426056142035
And for this we are to be thankful . 7.143631124870439
Of this she was perfectly <UNK> ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . 12.932424287743403
If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was <UNK> done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . With respect to that other , more <UNK> <UNK> , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only <UNK> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 20.861746243042738
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from <UNK> in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death <UNK> of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and <UNK> as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly <UNK> her father not to let her go . 17.474006013429488
It <UNK> me , I confess ; for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . 14.349969215448498
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 11.40961756544291
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <UNK> and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " Wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of accents , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right . 19.409490800714305
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 15.892184368154203
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 16.257387578791487
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 18.321012489632793
<UNK> and pride are different things , though the words are often used <UNK> . 24.574313852918525
Mr . Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . 13.666096437013048
These are <UNK> , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . 13.841648658609262
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . 14.876484748278164
have you heard from my uncle ? " " Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . " " Well , and what news does it bring ? 9.68785357523474
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short <UNK> . " " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . 14.009703009235563
I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . 9.024544950293311
and his sisters are charming women . 8.373622943593931
Sir William had been delighted with him . 8.400281496561066
Long . 3.6213039172052595
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . 13.719298633348584
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . " " I would wish not to be hasty in <UNK> any one ; but I always speak what I think . " " I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder . 11.06882671749794
" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <UNK> , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss <UNK> ' s . " " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . " " Oh ! 19.093902675966888
At length the Parsonage was <UNK> . 14.040825079003044
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . 9.568547585140987
You must learn some of my philosophy . 10.547823856281356
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . 21.45671516074779
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . " " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 10.1975221569865
The Foundation ' s principal office is located at <UNK> Dr . S . 33.48720215444767
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <UNK> every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were <UNK> abroad . 41.13798768749738
She is gone down to her uncle at <UNK> ; gone to stay . 12.485278128657555
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 8.218886291676613
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <UNK> , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 16.480220226632646
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . " Her father lifted up his eyes . 12.431516590590766
" Your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . 13.919177767291103
Jane was not happy . 3.884093578525815
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my <UNK> and <UNK> are not usually <UNK> by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of <UNK> ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . Pardon me . It pains me to offend you . inf
If I could but see you as happy ! 7.674995249792362
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! 19.24296202110736
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were <UNK> your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month . " " You have only proved by this , " cried Elizabeth , " that Mr . Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . 12.999757348282765
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . 8.673956849462986
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 9.217117397894464
When Mrs . 3.681174443487176
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
<UNK> inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in <UNK> ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the <UNK> Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . 33.18023229335995
" With my mother up stairs . 8.639774628902336
" I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth . 7.918062378727212
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 16.995307387798377
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 12.873830975770714
" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . 11.13380307558198
Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion . 6.354870736247981
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . 7.964092801181135
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . 15.39339391689827
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and <UNK> way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to morrow evening . 17.238539532344745
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though <UNK> with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 11.584948474674341
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . 7.8539446222038745
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth <UNK> out the coffee , in so close a <UNK> , that there was not a single <UNK> near her , which would admit of a chair . 19.296091215444463
Be so kind as to <UNK> for us to Miss Darcy . 12.000458605711898
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . 18.22000450120723
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . 14.046853500861037
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . 9.082990489684608
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , <UNK> from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and <UNK> by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 20.840172892319238
Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? " " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . 22.370842424846415
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> . 17.23684541441463

The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year . 24.430995222184094

Bennet , who <UNK> with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be <UNK> enough . 16.10768875090819
She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . Mr . Darcy said very little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all . 11.547213080592776

I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library .

" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her . 8.475278578988123
Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . 8.273504430204698
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 16.05947674052689
YOU AGREE THAT YOU <UNK> NO <UNK> FOR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . F . .

<UNK> me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . " Elizabeth could not refuse , though she <UNK> little pleasure in the visit . 11.335902229061508
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . 10.146486048936211
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . 14.005909255369028
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . 23.92089741906792
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . 14.400225783209669
Why any fear of detection ? 14.750258646791027
<UNK> of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where . 22.009419524249
I do think Mrs . 3.9964636725716334
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . " " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 10.402391829076679
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago . " " I have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said Mrs . 12.44162077450422
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a <UNK> space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . 13.782100241101231
But let me advise you to think better of it . 8.191066711941579
My poor father ! 9.181021002818747
She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most <UNK> by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . 13.0763882109107
With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . 16.487536176811247

" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam . 17.74556368807738
I have by no means done . 5.740150755595595
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . 15.003683921585782
She has known him only a fortnight . 8.488134872470074
Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? 22.406793463493482
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 17.176235019873072
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Perhaps I am not doing her justice . 8.906638942438844
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house . 10.458369803862992
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . 14.959347704201939
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " " That you certainly shall . " " And I have another favour to ask . 13.029224213916322
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 12.16440277690481
If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go . 9.379704958161707
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the <UNK> . " This was not very consoling to Mrs . 14.229662552655181
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 9.984338493098184
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . 18.409669405837732
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . 18.47126320882517
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 18.762831336419215
I had hoped that our sentiments <UNK> in every particular , but I must so far <UNK> from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . " " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . 19.475161361481685
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . 18.44270304377443
But self , though it would intrude , could not <UNK> her . 10.30042297912942
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . " " I see no occasion for that . 9.854097479885208
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 15.16609924987162
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . 13.216656784705032
They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy . 13.782867015207831
I wish you had been there . 4.480791940553521
At present I will say nothing about it . " " You are quite right . 9.98203687991882
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had <UNK> time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 13.741841962031687
She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband . 11.229203715148426
Nor was Darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 14.52730036408595
How was that possible ? 6.319580991152472
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of <UNK> . " He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . 13.636365734356506
But if I go on , I shall <UNK> you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . 13.050791789162831
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget ' had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ' Those were your words . 17.752906271349772
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should <UNK> an occasion of <UNK> his respect towards any body connected with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared . Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . 21.210227518041837
No , never . 3.3532268909293497
dear me ! 4.699896549664798
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . 13.887197250519076
So high and so conceited that there was no <UNK> him ! 18.28044363134845
Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane ' s ? 10.899233703143878
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being <UNK> dressed . 14.460794278211182
From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . 20.897075686654613
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 14.947449915857332

From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 21.86518934831094
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . 10.945096111419675
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . 30.950549358074532
Collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too . 13.965488514348502
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . " " And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? " " The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . 23.583630156124304
She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <UNK> in so small a family as her ' s , and <UNK> her as to the care of her <UNK> and her poultry . 17.26272091148085
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in <UNK> , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . 20.12684198341528
Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . 13.243667500359383
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . 10.805438198755818
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true <UNK> will derive benefit from such as are given . 22.438474403643873
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ? 14.246069181534628
In a few minutes , Mrs . 6.044931970003938
But no such recollection <UNK> her . 11.385170446568932
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? 15.855230132487353
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did . 11.963597149393609
Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . " Mr . Bennet made no answer . 9.353461891909449
" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any <UNK> , rather adds to your other perfections . 16.779073856502123
At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . 7.127231458694749
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth ! 14.146025047002956

Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 16.591846859311936
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . " " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 12.485757841839343
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our <UNK> ! 16.375755430097637
And who knows what may happen ? 16.22335682088221
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . 11.563355815743778
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open <UNK> rejected . 22.654133077610915
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a <UNK> table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the <UNK> of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . 18.706100198352637
" You may well warn me against such an evil . 14.269558589204582
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child . 14.363201777386768
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very <UNK> <UNK> for Netherfield were got by <UNK> . 24.937723505756086
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 10.545158490248422
On finding Mrs . 7.53427818391511
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . 16.084583921559457
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . " " I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 20.42286041972908
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <UNK> have alarmed her . 18.68040263986117

It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement . 19.789987935670418
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s <UNK> her coming so far alone . 20.211177334361928
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . " Miss Bennet eagerly <UNK> all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . 19.94442576781104
But I know the foundation is unjust . 9.063873535570892
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . 15.151957887194312
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . 13.80663789934209
Bennet , " I am quite delighted with him . 5.340537427634894
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? 19.34741116058514
Though Lydia ' s short letter to Mrs . 9.17845580854667
I fancy she was wanted about the <UNK> <UNK> . 16.96838894544933
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 10.718957665448164
It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . 9.212494430795998
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the <UNK> of my father ' s will , has been <UNK> acquainted with every particular of these transactions . 23.135662489770016
Bennet was restored to her usual <UNK> serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the <UNK> office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton . 27.629967072824616
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 19.838686462474378
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . " " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be <UNK> beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen . 14.925709976259201
" He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived . 7.239921379141818
I must beg to return to the house . " And she rose as she spoke . 8.180580124297789
She then <UNK> again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . " " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . " " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something <UNK> <UNK> in the usual <UNK> of such a meeting . 21.326137540637518
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . 7.378466702564264
Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an <UNK> sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she <UNK> him . 14.36070071668089
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 9.550480158062348
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected . 10.434857017993941
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 13.072236061551864
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and <UNK> them up , though as she never came without <UNK> some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or <UNK> , she seldom went away without leaving them more <UNK> than she found them . 28.210789272696196
Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their <UNK> their income . 19.788231682699973
Bennet , was not so well pleased with it . 4.885273925842851
" He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . 7.868073902537238
" Where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door . 9.709591012227174
The loo table , however , did not appear . 9.468893221981853
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . 21.654376664715038
<UNK> that may be , you are <UNK> to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs . 12.809323070103673
" Can you come to morrow ? " Yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 11.81491208663479
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . 15.561589317888368
He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 12.327802817166381
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " " But I was embarrassed . " " And so was I . " " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " " A man who had felt less , might . " " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 11.760524961431914
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . 9.759572543736873

But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 10.67527461051426
Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ' s <UNK> enough to <UNK> him from its <UNK> , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never <UNK> without him . " " So much the better . 18.2434595992378
I shall see her in January . 6.611730383119379
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <UNK> <UNK> . 20.76616867788192
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man . 20.984048647434005
He is so excessively handsome ! 10.796231405533291
He seldom appeared really animated . 17.79280342322691
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . 12.781825578568709
When this was done , she had a less active part to play . 10.043851695074691
" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face . 8.10703168694205
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . 14.943975001923336
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 22.234494131204762

Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . 12.4580120733417
She is grown so <UNK> and <UNK> ! 22.527178502890976
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . 15.214184775149421
how unlucky ! 7.837930815585813
CHAPTER V . 7.22349596044539
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 16.120015000699244
What congratulations will then flow in ! 15.642925627118284
<UNK> was the least of her feelings on this developement . 11.126712592781907
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself <UNK> watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . 12.168425196205499
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <UNK> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . 18.633018615472476
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! 6.540906906416975
" We can all plague and punish one another . 13.745043203829567
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 10.394137985039556
Elizabeth immediately <UNK> the livery , guessed what it meant , and <UNK> no small degree of surprise to her relations , by <UNK> them with the honour which she expected . 21.283612908544004
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged . 13.004635587421108
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane . 10.409007853482699
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? " " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . " " Oh ! 11.265920092953916
Hurst began again . 6.876451437001182
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <UNK> society . " " But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . " " Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . 15.216823703796086
" It may perhaps be pleasant , " replied Charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . 11.823169902402988
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . 13.656318690165698
From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an <UNK> chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . 18.47890386102521
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . 17.917360915793115
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 14.35406076397986
Jenkinson , who lives with them . 8.107410675679338
CHAPTER II . 6.996859120965737
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the <UNK> of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . 17.96691851128826
Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . 17.36309977546577
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 12.88065147095731
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . 14.262641139332707
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 11.448660555443215
This cannot be ! engaged to Mr . Darcy ! 7.439723403328785
Oh , sister ! 4.301908249994576
Let me hear from you very soon . 8.141700293335676
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? " " Most willingly . " " You shall have it in few words . 14.98543775055662
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . 11.659046251002996
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <UNK> . 17.291958598504653
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 10.110027245394836
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley ' s heart were entertained . 18.60478644877507
" Oh ! 3.731104652284054
Bingley and talked of Mrs . 4.190298351920115
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 11.236914486082267
I am very glad you liked her . 6.447865401016495
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . 14.873121870925607
" Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . " " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . " " Oh ! 10.701891228079301
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . 20.288864820598363
I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . " Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . 16.34094504052099
Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , <UNK> him I believe very early in life . 17.849895397611444
Well ! 4.840860784983619
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world . 12.363907707593711
He had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . 15.56725485279631
" My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . " They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . " " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence . " " You cannot be too much on your guard . 17.711555756912112
Why should they try to influence him ? 13.471342546714752
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . 13.276492263993857
Mr . Collins was carefully <UNK> them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <UNK> them . 16.65204134401941
This room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . 16.462375989107883
" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . " " You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . 18.756050883205784
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . 17.574559213041894
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . " " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth . 13.624646068216745
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <UNK> on such a research ; in which <UNK> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally <UNK> , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . 20.755376384403366
I thought it my duty to give the <UNK> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well <UNK> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . 21.155282119419887
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 18.21616820855567
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . 12.3080992973745
Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant <UNK> to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " I do not know . I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult . 9.149313469003856
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my <UNK> on your privilege of universal good will . 20.228332686958332
" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not <UNK> declare that Caroline neither <UNK> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <UNK> the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly ! to put me on my guard ? 22.16014375875918
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the coachman ' s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs . 20.910788127063604
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . 12.644175316732815
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . 10.066614796585906
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 13.56842620319583
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 12.5353116295872
Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 7.124203088167564
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . 8.885019615551625
I speak nothing but the truth . 5.970931819905953
" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . 16.460221616627873
Where does discretion end , and <UNK> begin ? 29.50720240086449
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 19.0492361698925
He leaves out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <UNK> . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must <UNK> reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility . 17.77410986175041
There is no indignity so <UNK> to their feelings ! " She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " " And quite alone ? 20.9003186287423
Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes . 16.906711472067997
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be <UNK> into it ? " " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to <UNK> with rather more <UNK> the degree of importance which is to <UNK> to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . 20.683554599666174
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 7.639252703176428
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . 8.386876669769766
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . 15.003365202642744
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 23.28280990323611
" DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations . 12.094330194632064
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged . 15.979099308998308
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . 9.733151874423855
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . 15.448285749417686
" Don ' t keep <UNK> so , Kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! 21.40377628631066
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 10.96582779507741
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . 11.545294914804948
" Good Heaven ! 9.037245073030142
Lady Catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . 19.622155137892868
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what <UNK> his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 14.15398790631229
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent <UNK> of <UNK> on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . 19.13140397142525
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . 11.557034932365832
CHAPTER XVII . 7.2234956205320096
There was no want of discourse . 7.9940869285184855
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were <UNK> in her favour . 14.291129540368138
Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 12.960629858811359
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . 14.377322116981365
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . " They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . 11.964859716386828
She had also to <UNK> how her visit would pass , the quiet <UNK> of their usual employments , the vexatious <UNK> of Mr . Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings . 20.52407676846961
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . 10.92712331491929
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 17.688544780864593
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG <UNK> PRIDE AND PREJUDICE This file should be named . <UNK> or . <UNK> This and all associated files of various formats will be found in <UNK> <UNK> editions will <UNK> the previous one the old editions will be <UNK> . 111.30375515180155
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week . 16.39726003297697
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 11.672368997136827
Your idea of the ponies is delightful . 10.406513916997422
Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 12.871491771195782
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . 14.752215471261533
But it is so strange ! " " Yes that is what makes it amusing . 11.223096110464596
I wonder what he can be doing there . " " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth . 11.582263062009556
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <UNK> <UNK> better than <UNK> ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 21.969811525192775
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 12.585826018899951
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . 21.453791537494617
The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for <UNK> as may be <UNK> to himself and not offensive to his patron . 17.923097110595233
But she is nothing to me now . 4.8916292293332635
Very well . 5.045833874321892
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . 13.572626311784402
She blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who <UNK> their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . 19.8732906628082
Her own thoughts were <UNK> her . 12.487434530931576
" What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . 6.612936164520407
CHAPTER XVI . 7.2234956205320096
I know it to be impossible . " " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! 9.275343562340893
" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet ' s manor . 10.916304749075369
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . 5.4628786025120935
Her report was highly favourable . 12.245749724897005
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 13.949104788619584
But it must not , shall not be . 3.9613477726367594
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . 14.450856050711488
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit . 14.147834989455806
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . 20.160093341847524
" Oh ! 3.731104652284054
Yes , I call it a very easy distance . " " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth . 9.399956807936855
He cannot afford it . 7.061039982045236
They were within twenty <UNK> of each other , and so <UNK> was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . 16.158868650500086
CHAPTER XIII . 7.223496220938243
Without a governess you must have been neglected . " " <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . 15.737024327360153
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 19.321181285430452
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over <UNK> , as I always am . 10.201983282348959
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 18.60622238488272
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . 14.957397523140889
But you know married women have never much time for writing . 12.667680456436743
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 16.769285661526247
what could she mean by it ? 6.599099647791215
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 11.74865469660572
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . 9.751521338738034
By Mrs . 4.600962548607173
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . 22.440309872919247
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them . 14.142799669568554
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 15.844623344501914
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 5.110016662555794
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr . Darcy . She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! Yet it did , and even a third . 24.05657102972176
Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . 12.016668434157118
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . 13.827144263555779
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and <UNK> them , after a short <UNK> , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . 23.45734657790188
Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits <UNK> high . 13.905903044250966
do any thing rather than marry without affection . 12.58825962695107
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . 23.0404515395715
I am glad he is gone . 6.080450687344022
He <UNK> , and <UNK> , and makes love to us all . 11.442580194484668
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of <UNK> from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a <UNK> horse . 32.21257477878868
Mr . Darcy replied with great <UNK> , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley . 8.612508555050686
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . 9.978281889865919

He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to <UNK> these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 16.564333981612254
Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . 8.21856585087517
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 21.536388557611918
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . 12.869414383938897
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . " " <UNK> their income ! 23.118224221571246
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . 14.742720111084564
<UNK> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 16.155079110176377
They came . 4.172588469992084
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . 16.469067879169238
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 35.20484809658895
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield . 16.641098543732163
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <UNK> . 16.498627893279817
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 15.265790809560244
Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 14.947863011684417
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? 15.635921072398745
and so did Mrs . 3.450282841527037
On Mr . and Mrs . 3.6351484162329455
Well , well , I only hope it will last . 6.139169601097977
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ? 16.69579343624898
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , <UNK> , manner of talking to her brother . 15.993242900454383
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . 9.292891982317359
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 22.53552069468514
CHAPTER XV . 7.2234956205320096
yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . 17.61651994392315
Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 8.597592571143199
I thank you for explaining it so fully . 11.247805031816371
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? 16.290087875833333
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 11.740448166755716
<UNK> , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . 19.474607710030373
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been <UNK> , and it had actually been <UNK> that Colonel Forster was going to be married . 19.306381840848537
" Oh ! 3.731104652284054
All field <UNK> were over . 21.75331198252377
Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better . 6.495167226285622
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . 17.496941271238164
<UNK> would like to go too of all things ! 14.354957111470286
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <UNK> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 21.13132508285221
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . 10.344146649045745
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . 10.387770633356103
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 10.260967118599883
" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt . 8.101709281618085
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . 13.417194322486262
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 14.262654107404666
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 22.129872011104286
I did not think Mrs . 4.175756965223348
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 20.544960915007646
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . 13.80339611111683
I wish I could see her . 4.286448729086785
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 7.550353892689846
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . 16.476064822529274
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford . 7.571996913049686
Could he , or the Lucases , have <UNK> on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the <UNK> more effectually to what they related ? 20.713172703042634
Elizabeth now began to <UNK> . 8.804509066191157
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears <UNK> the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the <UNK> . 19.486700578086726
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . 17.589368451744132
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 9.723707156908686
Mr . and Mrs . 2.334144763093918
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . " " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . 15.681703441643823
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . 19.526930719731013
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her <UNK> spirits , and of teaching her that her present <UNK> are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 13.857326991397976
<UNK> was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . 13.362450449527138
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . 10.918178191891629
Jenkinson to make up her party . 7.6933153374863155
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia ' s marriage . 10.843910738017906
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell <UNK> to mend a great <UNK> in my worked muslin gown , before they are <UNK> up . 27.857064378225097
Philips . The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . 12.269483834576747
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen . 16.81526584380628
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . " Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . 13.755206832914036
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . " " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . 8.673011532027338
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . " " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . 12.47539186752895
Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . " " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget . 17.721173781179566
but from what the report of their engagement could <UNK> , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . 12.71711974084258
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 15.925116908284359
I knew how it would be . 4.905690390896018
The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . 23.370186853562235
" The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . 6.699113141788753
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 10.374607349386304
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . 8.511771517081572
" ' Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much . 8.634304809828704
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon <UNK> deliberation , you find that the misery of <UNK> his two sisters is more than <UNK> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . " " How can you talk so ? " said Jane <UNK> smiling , " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . " " I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . " " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 16.81904345180746
I could hardly keep my countenance . 8.780093280740777
On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a <UNK> , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy . 20.00626643438382
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 8.419628605389972
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh . 16.007166541495224
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design . 11.619417050194487
Well , how pleased I am ! 7.636170932023111
The first part of Mrs . 5.519377249295544
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 11.27785397688535
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 22.556069963796872
Will you come and see me ? " " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . " " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . 10.812930026130166
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . 16.5746935538938
They were natural and just . 6.813792650098374
" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? " " To morrow fortnight . " " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . 7.479098340609272
What shall we do with him ? 8.382669744521614
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 18.249010298520997
my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . " " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . 12.77010128840457
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement . 14.321884225159295
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented . 17.059482304351672
I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . 12.199254665358964
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . 14.592725207956637
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . 14.118572524740305
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 13.56842620319583
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey . 15.392858831033042
" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . 12.892223253288378
" <UNK> <UNK> . " CHAPTER XIII . 15.658434508822454
Elizabeth merely <UNK> to him , without saying a word . 10.926905813410508
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature . 22.91018182937561
Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s sufferings . 16.860320883142148
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . 12.99981149834625
<UNK> was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth " My dearest Lizzy , " I <UNK> myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . 24.572838933277577
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of <UNK> and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 22.438726038635323
Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . 11.958779199030172
He comes down on Thursday at the <UNK> , very likely on Wednesday . 19.12384077301993
A <UNK> life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . 15.168258439686701
Let her go then . 6.173875800697116
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> . 20.982278840915782
CHAPTER XIX . 7.2234956205320096
In the former were many good <UNK> ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some <UNK> of Miss Darcy ' s , in <UNK> , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . 23.6318805192598
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . 16.907762441499678
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 10.08306014570412
In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . 11.801531809700533
Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 12.305625975748171
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> . 10.96962106424404
Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their <UNK> in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . 16.82692401861741
<UNK> more than half a day ' s journey . 13.978466307991871
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . 8.794465874067729
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . 10.731495927764788
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it . 18.294476100932897
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 15.830301809487132
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <UNK> from the marriage of her sisters . 14.486359923302143
I know not what to think . 3.8114197230626212
<UNK> you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters . 16.088883331916463
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . 10.811807875462591
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 7.766798678346001
There was no help for it however . 6.814460120005326
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! 17.736735944481964
Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . 15.535336524697662
And what do you think she said besides ? 10.377329671647814
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 26.329040279943726
" Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " From the former . 13.262741977517425
But I am at his disposal . 6.623359968857303
But however he did not . 4.7037971120395925
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <UNK> . 16.882783964432388
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <UNK> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <UNK> , and paid off every <UNK> of civility to Elizabeth . 21.94777026524713
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <UNK> , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 11.963774878805127
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . " " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request . 12.210332911306116
How is such a man to be worked on ? 9.096926452283446
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 15.631834522860037
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 15.84986626727267
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . 14.180465873450785
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <UNK> , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . 17.02320566924215
But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 14.82790955769869
In the hall they parted . 8.73017388388179
The morrow produced no <UNK> of Mrs . 14.690481625641802
If , indeed , it should be so ! 5.229273380196917
Section . 4.064776368428645
Mr . Bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . 22.362108795800477
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <UNK> him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 21.366851235968426
Philips first brought her the news . " Well , so much the better . 7.883686554990191
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 13.434636837990853
I was ready to die of laughter . 8.866805953837819
Elizabeth was <UNK> enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 11.127456725895357
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy . 11.253548592382316
Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . 14.785669703167695
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . 16.48950139413747
They would doubtless be <UNK> with the generality of female minds . 24.896897011957304
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . 14.651486933897049
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 16.180526993048453
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . 10.195418300256213
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 13.153321701508226
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <UNK> , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 13.791871305034325
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 7.807979535658784
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . 12.983023335606005
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 11.466659283226832
" Wickham so very bad ! 7.217784011157894
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . 25.13282104233627
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s . 13.451314244849774
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from <UNK> my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . 18.164459627871718
Younge was of course removed from her charge . 11.511215683931352
. F . . <UNK> You agree to <UNK> and hold the Foundation , the trademark owner , any <UNK> or <UNK> of the Foundation , anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement , and any volunteers associated with the <UNK> , <UNK> and distribution of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works , <UNK> from all liability , costs and expenses , including legal fees , that arise directly or <UNK> from any of the following which you do or cause to occur a distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg tm work , <UNK> alteration , <UNK> , or additions or <UNK> to any Project Gutenberg tm work , and c any <UNK> you cause . 42.62603244421783
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs . 11.901970716577914
" It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . 6.384405347562168
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances and to have Mr . Collins instead ! 17.82718535961928
Poor dear child ! 13.455029583313491
How odious I should think them ! " " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " " I am afraid you do not like your pen . 12.733674427870353
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . 9.768841951083006
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . 12.273852518967457
" Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . " He should be particularly happy at any time , c . 10.938016338281967
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? 7.570228167828479
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley . 9.318164555335406
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . 11.256415542930778
My father bears it better . 10.466523953985545
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up . 11.599802596628457
" I am sure there is not on his . 4.753664147870752
What do I not owe you ! 8.479636260197136
Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself . 15.313662748275844
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so <UNK> ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . 16.46551947159827
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ' s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . 17.93398055049712
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening . 14.784369041348626
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . 12.58160595300789
Could there be finer symptoms ? 21.182050326671135
<UNK> , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . " " And do you <UNK> it to either of those ? " " Yes ; to the last . 10.55597810016857
She often tried to provoke Darcy into <UNK> her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . 22.651848899189496
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . 15.268493957857487
Mr . Darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . 7.829324367645612
You cannot have been always at Longbourn . " Elizabeth looked surprised . 9.130885082901356
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 22.923761899984935
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . 13.231901970985092
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . 13.537408879029355
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn house . 28.416514216456488
The day passed much as the day before had done . 8.633507781366623
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 6.281816610531339
If he fears me , why come hither ? 16.613393351547852
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . 11.454061811369028
so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! 10.54498324715114
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . 11.896268624800868
<UNK> Michael S . 23.70544817884973
How strange must it appear to him ! 10.474463861543041
I hope he will overlook it . 6.604004290883494
This match , to which you have the presumption to <UNK> , can never take place . 11.62260450709786
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 14.463135952388132
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 26.048644829824863
that abominable Mr . Darcy ! My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to <UNK> it . 13.626237721396024
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new <UNK> . 17.272527451880688
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . 18.56012444234584
Bennet was <UNK> engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <UNK> them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather <UNK> than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . 19.61017466685079
He studies too much for words of four <UNK> . Do not you , Darcy ? " " My style of writing is very different from yours . " " Oh ! " cried Miss Bingley , " Charles <UNK> in the most careless way imaginable . 20.755848231995998
I speak <UNK> . 7.75641118722754
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out . She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . 15.794281111073888
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! 15.723442454205781
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . 12.618843447681714
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane . 7.3624080226530255
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ? 13.143548090663577
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most <UNK> in inviting Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 17.25161082671341
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . 13.499782863800252
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . 10.375472028112874
what has she to do with it ? 5.051930346521627
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . " " To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 10.884474659103578
When they were all in the drawing room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . 11.751601379346319
<UNK> requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much <UNK> and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements . 35.86048462918506
' Ah ! 6.908768398256615
Your <UNK> are by no means unlike . 19.432901384489327
I can recal nothing worse . 11.14603160645454
Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <UNK> . 18.939018843448604
I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the <UNK> . 8.085737306578038
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 16.92299901037665
never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F . 10.330729255954985
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that . 13.912331642393038
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . 11.085219589630402
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the <UNK> of his confidence in his friend . 16.89812840396761
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North . 11.509088934236058
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to <UNK> his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be <UNK> <UNK> . 15.614575233278849
It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 22.033645003906674
The dejection was almost universal . 13.336077422750654
" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . 8.006648819775496
But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . " " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother . 8.58710160432294
Then pray speak aloud . 16.30734990202581
Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . 13.413406574227531
Lydia ' s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , <UNK> engaged with one of the <UNK> <UNK> in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little <UNK> , of his house and garden at Hunsford . 15.157176882740051
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child . 15.88495107896669
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 26.82266550807826
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr . Darcy . 9.408357505460344
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his <UNK> , all honoured with the <UNK> of <UNK> , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . 18.433018745686248
But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . 5.470172713156433
Elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several <UNK> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . 22.168328268608427
<UNK> those who are at all his <UNK> in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . 15.935863360043866
I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . 12.964232557091952
But it was not to be . 2.8732982798722473
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! 13.253501050370987
and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! 7.4141953206781865
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . 13.029816060755511
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . 29.9271564891153
We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . 16.914040051667573
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of <UNK> on Mr . Collins ' s side , and as many bows on Sir William ' s , they departed . 19.016046002845876
To Mrs . 3.8804846502317085
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate . 14.482913478262356
It was first broken by Mrs . 7.86618359006766
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . 13.115973005360209
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is <UNK> the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken <UNK> , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . 16.283069706335073
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . 13.206763256856233
She <UNK> the days that must <UNK> before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . 21.763192413147003
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . " " Your first <UNK> is false . 14.111452619519751
It was over at last however . 6.7224161812095105
One day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . 13.807688267737136
My mind was more agreeably engaged . 12.380806196516666
Two <UNK> , however , were plainly <UNK> from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been <UNK> used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 18.067849106153016
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . 13.743732108991848
I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a <UNK> up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 10.742268545983341
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 18.378632156626054
Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very <UNK> too for it is provoking me to <UNK> , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly . 12.55276449465476
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . 11.022591122124888
One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! 8.68311402885279
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . 15.625498435002122
Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual <UNK> ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the <UNK> of his thoughts . 16.582365289813712
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals . 12.94142581850902
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . 20.78436979591191
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 12.624261905308026
Mary was obliged to <UNK> more with the world , but she could still <UNK> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <UNK> between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <UNK> to the change without much <UNK> . 21.443774969305476
My aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . " " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . 12.586977317209094
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 10.704947681619979
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 9.388788303401594
Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley ' s continued absence . 9.505278547691251
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 18.09484323255856
In that case he would return no more . 8.743802963144537
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . " " She is a very fine looking woman ! 8.173741014311993
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <UNK> your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter . 17.341612515587435
Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . " Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . 11.634352662638504
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned . 18.514479026327113
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . 10.5891371080754
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . 17.140899054063404
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 9.948562042171073
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 13.655556998146203
My courage always <UNK> with every attempt to <UNK> me . " " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . " Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . 17.071793383197924
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . 10.619220845053176
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . 11.111610217298857
" Oh ! 3.731104652284054
Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . 11.627864029345503
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 19.886455160261992
Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise . 6.808204516189721
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . 14.612336522558623
They were in street . 5.588958891702405
Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . 10.404500410367884
" Yes , Ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as <UNK> to the poor . " Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . 11.500674310095588
I promised them so <UNK> ! 12.60358583497654
" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . 11.715422985954383
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 17.66712390423162
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 12.868076617863922
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . " " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <UNK> which other people may observe . 22.699615837286117
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . 7.40821083763337
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 13.397512688481275

With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . 18.30399383207041

The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . 11.867061040807505
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . " The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . 12.243447683121888
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 12.563052443124263

Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .

I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have <UNK> domestic felicity in so <UNK> a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . 17.967361154473522

Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <UNK> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . 14.017795152166915
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . 8.36020554368789
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . 8.66116520277134
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . 12.7442434979577
With many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs . 18.771051851261003
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . 12.01407606631651
Oh , no . " " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . " " No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . " " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . " She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . 12.788098018240946
If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 8.795378165154906
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . 15.819578857078996
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 12.389126399230955

As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 15.94693209890262
" How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! 7.874065450778129
In understanding Darcy was the superior . 7.649804161078992
The particulars , I reserve till we meet . 11.375452544372287
He danced only four dances ! 18.3486475991862
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . 13.846854136516603
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! 20.431049007697617
And poor Mr . Darcy ! 6.433225463918819
Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . 16.608602329895017
shocking ! " cried Miss Bingley . 7.790662834379863
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " Lydia declared herself satisfied . 11.089367656884553
CHAPTER V . 7.22349596044539
c . " Mr . Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . 12.869166375121418
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . 12.000171781230982
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room . 12.441596147534197
Nothing could be more delightful ! 10.661531084439952

<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 14.955842167281855
But gracious me ! 8.080629982273802
GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 21.726981969498247
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . 19.73309003504835
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . 15.951263668010757
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . 22.305636135831822
" My dear , dear aunt , " she <UNK> cried , " what delight ! 9.408776011035023
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 27.153732133615936
My sisters may write to me . 7.58513938063486
She opened the door , and met Maria in the <UNK> place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza ! 14.836463113498194
But we must <UNK> the tide of malice , and <UNK> into the wounded <UNK> of each other , the <UNK> of sisterly consolation . " Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " <UNK> as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is <UNK> that one false step <UNK> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <UNK> than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 28.98362613359078
That he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . 10.533771611636869
my dear , " continued Mrs . 4.373869957282716
I hope we may often meet again . " Elizabeth smiled . 9.789078888963132
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . 13.500450778442074
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . " The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they <UNK> satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had <UNK> Mrs . 16.296472249404257
Gardiner . 2.6911073080185557
<UNK> since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 13.999435549172132
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 13.14677495698762
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . 13.522436470672003
' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! What , all five out at once ? 11.933353347698612
The garden <UNK> to the road , the house standing in it , the <UNK> pales and the <UNK> <UNK> , every thing declared they were <UNK> . 25.394278171883908
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 11.757921695552033
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 16.391490854286854
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 12.803581645315536
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . 11.368180261815885
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s <UNK> . 14.95397260461227
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Bennet one communication would , therefore , do for all . 6.6134160673028575
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 10.303177450269407
She shared in their attendance on Mrs . 10.795626928891817
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . 9.75843970093798
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . 15.436187159899301
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 19.998624513564174
My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . 25.33185633028458
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " <UNK> so I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . 12.20712593227437
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of <UNK> them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <UNK> , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the <UNK> kind . " She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <UNK> by any feeling of <UNK> . 22.306581924038756
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 10.403084980189119
Bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . 12.48246547194567
He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . 16.364909831585805
I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . 14.2276783191691
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on . 19.32875670620838
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? " A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and <UNK> and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . 22.27899606368032
" <UNK> Oh ! 9.58090419263397
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more . 8.397590752690226
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 19.652968063747057
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> . 17.250182616123418
It was to this effect " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well . 18.29610818121222
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 15.464041421363135
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the <UNK> of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . 15.549300368212625
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained . 18.051913705418237
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be <UNK> at , and it was rather too early to begin . 12.564715057827431
His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . 11.600415572065366
Thank God ! 13.813124177005195
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 13.18404027504945
They <UNK> as expeditiously as possible ; and <UNK> one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day . 24.31813341025652
CHAPTER X . 7.2234956205320096
The adieu is <UNK> itself . 19.783202911023448
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . 20.751381102530114
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was <UNK> her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs . 12.967891710815127
Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a <UNK> season , made her feel that the <UNK> , <UNK> , most thread bare <UNK> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <UNK> . 25.7405063879397
you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 16.565568127937265
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 12.18802610886201
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . Bingley was <UNK> to Darcy by the easiness , openness , <UNK> of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . 18.683581382258865
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 19.048806326072544
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 16.5061987280331
You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her <UNK> , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . 14.696706950639093
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . 8.374388764161411
Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . 18.34622268114995
But it was a hope shortly checked by other <UNK> , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . 20.552779857175402
How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! 14.196725096346462
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister . 9.117517823651845
You are lucky in having such a master . " " Yes , Sir , I know I am . 7.888859394227295
Lord ! 6.020360314179646
But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . 17.091850211903036
What do you keep winking at me for ? 13.566779083417085
" Well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " What say you to the day ? 7.408323597290465
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance <UNK> , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . 20.896961809172375
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . 12.914607483318287
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . " Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . 14.35157920119099
Elizabeth took up some <UNK> , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . 18.61766525716056
She had been <UNK> pleased to approve of both the <UNK> , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . 15.621083403966216
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 17.01065415291413
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . " " You are over <UNK> surely . 11.647180993493228
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 10.094115242934746
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s t te t te with Mrs . 18.162164777820898
But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . 11.398385071453461
They are wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? " " They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . " " But if you have got them to day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered . " She did at last <UNK> from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . 13.823296452149924
I ought not to have said a word about it . 6.018159739595159
Pray do not talk of that odious man . 11.175980472081259
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference . 7.833491908214356
She practises very constantly . " " So much the better . 11.014566653717166
Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <UNK> and <UNK> father ; and though he belonged to one of the <UNK> , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 22.15570260531483
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . 14.03888706609748
Such a disappointment ! 8.910966463251285
" You look pale . 7.282967704288525
Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 15.726403870979695
Every thing being settled between them , Mr . Darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home . 15.889921225364173
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it . 9.136698087566744
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as , by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . 15.279929658400995
Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . 11.391017138628326

Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the <UNK> , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 20.33888030342284
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . 13.658804796168006
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 12.539303092009018
But though every thing seemed <UNK> and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <UNK> ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . 19.10695899619873
Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority . 18.773189308650224
" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she . 6.265923253190685
" What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut . 8.085856785822477
" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the <UNK> that is laid on them , as nonsense ? 14.032368730030631
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . 8.931220169351878
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . 15.32982219211989
Their visits to Mrs . 7.0536194894918305
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ? 22.415789294966523
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . " Elizabeth could not <UNK> a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . 15.158694195755167
" I am sorry it went off . 6.775802977942916
" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 13.822060434385982
Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him . 9.392959886872227
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . 13.065724737923128
After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F . 19.933289033708864
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . 13.370016271986833
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 18.468263194586108
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 8.695141566487273
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 16.463475927814354
<UNK> any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . " " Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . 21.8914773902147
Have you had any flirting ? 12.122347476486693
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . 5.24739247172245
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday . 21.28386543464094
When is your turn to come ? 9.002836075187922
it is just as he <UNK> . 7.768830903991109
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . 13.607287500932676
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . 12.895257976926459
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . 8.435150695401672
Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . 6.549966190408022
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 16.84487575680971
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <UNK> , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 22.52601060763317
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 10.662191998758818
CHAPTER IX . 7.2234956205320096
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 17.920437296277477
Hurst and Miss Bingley . 4.748793081480914
F . 3.5848983901705034
But Mrs . 3.0238131918448725
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . 18.82777103882007
Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . 9.335355919581927
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ' s regiment . " His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative . 18.415928815200495
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . 10.839951516601701
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united <UNK> . 21.34123831580698
As no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins ' s scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . 10.80974284958169
That is the place to get husbands . 8.890763416026866
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs . 21.448713028451927
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 12.721612258385528
The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 12.41554956723067
I am ashamed of you ! 5.442319284816649
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 7.079689471230161
I do not trust my own partiality . 8.676871619481688
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried . 6.332366259978846
Have you seen any pleasant men ? 16.92255535410144
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern <UNK> , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . 18.053807510414607
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " " Are you , indeed ? 7.938617146570515
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . 14.345254609848933
Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 11.558795308313979
" Excuse my interference . It was kindly meant . " " <UNK> girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . 17.492593092590692
no it is not for me to be driven away by Mr . Darcy . 6.423390740844164
<UNK> to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . 14.632322248647117
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many <UNK> of that nature . 22.18074138180967
" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? 11.661243352580646
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can ' t think . 15.975729735978131
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 16.774377286821263
Mr . Collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . 10.378158323686318
CHAPTER XI . 7.2234956205320096
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 6.882177468294463
" You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried . 6.695042732236459
Make haste , make haste . 13.348033721148092
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . 22.13568943771608
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . " " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us . 17.823704957331923
Your mother <UNK> upon your accepting it . 19.563775360636942
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! 11.540817571834138
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . " " I am , " said he , with a firm voice . 8.23665469778737
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 14.840006573579442
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . " Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire . 15.79239077026317
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? 12.130799324471536
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few <UNK> , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <UNK> . " Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 21.95361778225325
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . 12.587201300564056
I shall <UNK> it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . " And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh ! 15.92252209202072
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . 18.1515178711986
But he is an ugly fellow ! 13.39377069802732
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and <UNK> mercenary ; and the <UNK> of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to <UNK> at any thing . 25.16344321767177
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and <UNK> to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head . 13.028617793708268
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her <UNK> intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . 12.98364156655526
He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . 12.824607921218526
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a <UNK> kind of a little <UNK> on one side of your lawn . 17.94543119778576
Her <UNK> are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . 14.750872976630527
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 22.382433859243545
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . 11.733969892541936
She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . 17.727248900332526
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general . 12.583027989647938
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! 14.338809924841179
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uncle Philips , <UNK> <UNK> wine , who followed them into the room . 19.39614181200335
Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and <UNK> her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family . 13.22281983857641
He was on one side of her mother . 5.639532862656276
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . 7.692994242132035
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . " It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . 22.86562413037458
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . " " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . 12.602999500189622
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . 13.928762232885981
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . 8.881783830674623
Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton . 9.05305272572572
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty . 13.73861973307297
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 8.583781873656928
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . 19.69704039086763
who could have done less for her ? 7.512640200767135
Collins , did I tell you of Lady <UNK> ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? 16.284097274181104
The pain of separation , however , might be <UNK> on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . 14.581523205686617
<UNK> him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her . 23.72977975414941
I know you will contrive it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . 12.941174553206707
<UNK> , selfish girl ! 15.595845856872574
Not a soul knew of it , but <UNK> . 11.371008677446941
There can be no occasion for your going so soon . 10.280326492995165
Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day . 19.455586635506858
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . 14.344127112689405
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very <UNK> in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . 16.312896156688204
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . 15.172714580925769
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can <UNK> so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most <UNK> to a <UNK> ' s mind . 23.36134511398565
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . " " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . " " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . " " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . " " But consider your daughters . 12.775234066394647
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be <UNK> to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a <UNK> nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . 23.7328575146329
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so <UNK> ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and <UNK> , " Let me call your maid . 16.693785496846736
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 14.059041321190353
Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! 13.870266524068647
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . 6.098958681073564
She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 11.216161893136276
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " " You have . 10.577202435626257
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister . 15.335569301821495
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . 14.366400139678937
what news ? 5.989738244304377
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . " Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs . 8.677731590533034
But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came . 16.502956669024908
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 12.158197752760174
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 11.136504217704646
It is Mr . Bingley I am sure . 5.030404932767595
Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . 13.542061559146726
How well it <UNK> . 9.656457196992275
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . 20.15200040427479
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . 7.935346791605129
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 6.740216196983796
But it is of small importance . " " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and <UNK> me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? 14.588110149356135
" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . 8.788058970177145
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side . 16.72827916081791
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 13.8232683942997
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . 6.600456435986111
That tall , proud man . " " Good gracious ! 13.668793537220516
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 15.081487662580024
" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . 13.860942008591968
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <UNK> for Mr . Darcy ' s pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham . 20.79863315429008
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this <UNK> . 20.703510349846233
And is it really true ? 9.083023537724726
I told Mrs . 3.7049705248002747
For God ' s sake , say no more of his partners . 13.449817010706365
CHAPTER XVIII . 7.223496220938243
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . 16.62006112493442
She was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . 18.02260994773833
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <UNK> them . 8.522754470376162
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . 13.763824365443194
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself . 18.11043549237463

Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . 10.852437043168662
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy . 17.881095783546126
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . 21.678528320543595
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . 11.325785675372112
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . 8.86979597593114
I have no such <UNK> to resent . 9.727015307889083
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 17.34162621329127
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose <UNK> of <UNK> support . 46.35525828997204
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " I saw you look at me to day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . 12.002666557940291
why did she come ? 8.284908004633134
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . 27.36606811730042
That is all to be forgot . 6.315999582653254
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 17.076176461146016
I will only add , God bless you . 11.410586265365724
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . 8.501659076812201
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first <UNK> his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . 16.865542779756392
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . 16.377359113274032
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . 7.2490190973213595
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . 14.974898384536669
Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . 8.139356354733055
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 9.369778547778676
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . 16.90047339108576
In such an <UNK> my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I <UNK> upon his goodness . " " Oh ! 18.0148996673732
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! 23.253694587959597
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . " " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal <UNK> of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first <UNK> for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . 16.370377546166452
How much you must have gone through ! " Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs . 10.054165789174148
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . 9.755041818452359
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . 12.562001062320254
It was in the <UNK> and the <UNK> , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . 8.103989458716553
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 14.152518077236305
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 12.118643937272319
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . 9.043209485020242
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 19.430934532112726
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day . " " Oh , yes . 11.773367363016483
" Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . 3.9228993863170527
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 17.318752094612503
What a fine thing for our girls ! " " How so ? 11.800649516088829
That he was surprised by the <UNK> was evident ; he <UNK> it however with <UNK> , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner . 17.051802091730256
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane " I hope and trust they will yet be happy . 14.230067943605198
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . 12.19420309603514
She represented to him all the <UNK> of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . 13.99769611907901
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object . 9.35003613601949
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . 10.165940863012203
I am going away myself . " " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . " And upon Elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr . Collins . " Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . 19.554484790698634
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 10.081248012624702
They will never be distressed for money . 9.698675342683432
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 8.644238667087286
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 7.413962968094391
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the <UNK> , and was soon out of sight . 13.931932961894168
But now it comes out . " " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows . 11.182042382520764
Bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . 14.157800692823429
is she handsome ? " " She is a most charming young lady indeed . 10.076840455340273
GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . 11.145301250541376
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . 9.710921512027742
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes <UNK> , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . 17.110250961507585
" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . 11.460224178304317
CHAPTER <UNK> . 8.805540922633503
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 9.02765733435351
CHAPTER XI . 7.2234956205320096
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . 16.719601102036613
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . " " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? " " Indeed I had . 17.31866274058304
Mr . Collins received and returned these <UNK> with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <UNK> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 24.216733141616448
Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for . 6.048967071612367
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . " " Oh ! " said Lydia <UNK> , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , I ' <UNK> the <UNK> . " The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . 13.551596020614461
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . 13.154054754317816
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . 11.492092343336326
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to <UNK> the engagements that had been made for him . 19.963099625586985
no . " " I can much more easily believe Mr . Bingley ' s being imposed on , than that Mr . Wickham should <UNK> such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , <UNK> , every thing mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr . Darcy contradict it . 15.88743364419529
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest <UNK> ; his <UNK> contracted , his air gloomy . 19.7492706926751
If the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the <UNK> . 35.60590044300925
She <UNK> from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . 17.646383519302297
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 6.8496575108115065
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . 7.4978955241709455
At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! 17.547280886185078
" You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice . 11.055186704817952
Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated . 22.91632880269022
It became her turn to listen . 9.334356804354083
He begged pardon for having displeased her . 15.140392420172367
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 15.476211853678064
' Tis as good as a Lord ! 11.239132558952717
When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . 10.219559990661617
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 10.910934396278321
but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley ' s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the <UNK> have no horses to theirs . " " I had much rather go in the coach . " " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure . 11.30403185655613
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . 17.154221889658068
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . 23.9179795439564
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 7.101014023146011
" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr . Darcy ? " " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . " " I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . 11.835982254300221
was not a man to be trusted . 4.76666342433893
There is a <UNK> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . 13.24820718286397
In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . 11.339463162405515
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . 11.785404218941137
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so <UNK> with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and <UNK> of her own family ! 16.872869307885818
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford <UNK> , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 21.719925495903748
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . 15.648698943288768
yes . 3.5190550626480674
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she <UNK> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . 20.258279563857453
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified . 12.159916201401078
He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , <UNK> friend . 12.681769498359284
Long has promised to introduce him . " " I do not believe Mrs . 8.586703541473613
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 12.23233940560221
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . 12.03107141255424
I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! 13.840888749685934
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . " " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . 10.74702294554408
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever . " Darcy was fixed in astonishment . 11.48379025877065
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . 12.02537953134211
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <UNK> <UNK> her there . 14.943464715253327
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 14.880135272737592
only think ! 4.971633355540169
At length Darcy spoke , and in a <UNK> manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . " " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with <UNK> , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . " Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . 17.775474925854464
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 8.312279654671336
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 16.303516661637477
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 18.74958211116197
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 13.835832289995276
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a <UNK> ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 17.463957759085464
What <UNK> money , what <UNK> , what carriages you will have ! 19.47966339099461
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . 13.09769984267586
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 9.670132726538807
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . 11.249524309382931
It is of all subjects my delight . 7.864408477013528
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " Oh ! " cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted . 15.232016600763503
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley . 14.618224212679124
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 23.323446122610697
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . 16.579561346977595
Collins . 2.4214537247244583
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . " " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . 9.900716515922392
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . " " If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . 14.028221603238334
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . 9.48520108132787
I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . 11.102313097480893
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . 8.576026512422942
<UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> . 16.996355206970765
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . 16.194263317113176
He knows where we live . 12.450511528325972
She could think only of her letter . 5.415324193288741
Her answer , therefore , was not <UNK> , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . 9.850770769283375
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! 13.18412419737188
<UNK> pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . 10.931157764823082
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . 12.71445624437633
Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! Yes certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . " And <UNK> her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma ' am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr . Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . 16.037564094489873
London Printed for T . 14.15070991601398
He readily agreed to it . 6.938709265366523
She comes to us to day . 5.9897682971842965
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . " " You may depend upon it , Madam , " said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , " that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . " Mrs . 11.990398481843917
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 11.720260322022401
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs . 8.132029410661643
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said . 14.770500324495332
<UNK> , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . 16.69793592749496
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . 11.02304533606038
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , <UNK> over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in <UNK> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 14.874728298156231
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and <UNK> forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . 14.98854614557365
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . 6.87291882418974
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 7.491340400567326
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 14.014125046918146
We will go round the Park every day . 13.207390413029541
Besides , it will not much signify what one <UNK> this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . " " Are they indeed ? " cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . 15.419771120243439
I enquired after their brother , of course . 7.404604018086589
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 10.818181895824246
But now it was all too natural . 7.0081689858083935
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 10.73536655660936
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including <UNK> , online payments and credit card donations . 45.78168089424604
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <UNK> , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . 13.893299725628761
that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! 8.554127980184282
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 13.171614561367347
Her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 18.869818152526744
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . 9.77655015423317
A regard for the <UNK> would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . 23.113666056525794
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of <UNK> the mind of his wife . 27.79726756156783
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . 13.38061965586829
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and <UNK> the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 20.873265836247608
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 11.439818415269075
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 16.19124473115362
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 18.77549095480271
Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at <UNK> , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs . 19.952655945635417
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 15.169772191581274
She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 12.863970132039684
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason . 12.260670865668487
Lakes , mountains , and <UNK> , shall not be <UNK> together in our <UNK> ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . 33.842679730431
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , <UNK> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . 16.32373405860984
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . 16.139556150227907
You are safe from me . " " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . " " And your defect is a <UNK> to hate every body . " " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . " " Do let us have a little music , " cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . " Louisa , you will not mind my <UNK> Mr . Hurst . " Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . 15.855137147335968
Forster . 3.108434207919131
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 16.65237904973615
Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " Lord , how tired I am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn . 23.081385680523354
And she was only sixteen last June . 12.476979502382447
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there . 24.817642343619923
But you do not know all . 4.67939651328532
" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . 11.69781895048047
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs . 7.960616104145687
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 10.67764972742265
Mr . Bennet accepted the <UNK> , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . 21.56067174999614
The <UNK> would be spoilt by <UNK> a fourth . 27.16544451924863
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . 10.662083538331533
When the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , <UNK> her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment <UNK> . 19.080845029544435
We had better not mention it . 6.901406250186666
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . 7.746830373625889
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . " <UNK> as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat <UNK> , she had all the success she expected . 20.235229980515854
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . " " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the <UNK> manner which I see so many women ' s do . 17.31404312467664
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the <UNK> ere long . " " Upon my word , Sir , " cried Elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . 16.142746251251836
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . 7.7564374731793935
I never saw such a long <UNK> in my life . 11.354960506487183
Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 14.569958804057414
Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the <UNK> ? 17.989261108771277
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . 17.330449771098163
But , alas ! 6.30818401259383
" Did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ? 6.644947433817203
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . 14.40761570729092
" Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 11.386185102855139
That lady I suppose is your mother . " Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . 10.083546786544595
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . 12.685289780682197
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one <UNK> idea of any thing . 16.68172096338155
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 10.521397890878777
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 17.855202555139545
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 10.171761182484419
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply <UNK> on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . 25.08890791121287
But the case is this . 4.727084377796718
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 16.660276089665565
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and <UNK> <UNK> with great perseverance . 22.939292421666703
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 13.090747814697181
her liveliness had been never worse <UNK> . 15.732504474946692
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 15.557367879543813
" What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? 6.0697708790091705
<UNK> , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ? 10.131830305907183
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been <UNK> by long expectations . 12.322977621531619
Elizabeth <UNK> the next morning to the same thoughts and <UNK> which had at length closed her eyes . 19.452172413953203
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . " " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an <UNK> , <UNK> disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will <UNK> the whole room , and be handed down to <UNK> with all the <UNK> of a <UNK> . " " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he . 20.462832240111226
Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in <UNK> . 16.79456039981681
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? " " Oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all . 9.440570965347613
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 12.648518323076614
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . 6.280048996198248
She had even learnt to <UNK> , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a <UNK> to disgust and weary . 18.470611858913596
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . 14.04346866201912
It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . 18.296365554412123
She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . 10.28155991097843
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? 15.340585267946038
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the <UNK> curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two <UNK> of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . The envelope itself was likewise full . <UNK> her way along the lane , she then began it . 26.684330730299664
When you told Mrs . 5.590087978350962
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . 11.588442932462739
" Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . 8.326304784666831
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest <UNK> , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any <UNK> display of regard , or any <UNK> of manner , where their two <UNK> only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 19.494296085827916
<UNK> and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was <UNK> and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . 15.895057461929083
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal . " " True . 10.699604179919335
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of inviting him . " " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . 12.722916602808514
She will not be able to help calling . " " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 15.665577393305783
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 19.469138687858003
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance . 28.98086019984933
We have not met since the th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . " Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when <UNK> to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn . 17.001107301870935
She will make him a very proper wife . " Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the <UNK> , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly <UNK> whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way . 20.02146799453883
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation . 17.407987580708706
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . 21.680828293729935
" I never heard any thing so abominable . 8.239819597366454
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 12.755443845097107
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two <UNK> with Jane again , and the two <UNK> with Lizzy , and the <UNK> " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! 15.394502885612098
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by <UNK> the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . 20.02480755223861
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . 16.521361462724073
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 12.824292053584463
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . 13.246789044866768
A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it <UNK> from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . 18.60431037728963
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 7.01909496573779
But , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . 8.407093349543707
I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 10.290415848235204
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 12.30613194174731
But your arts and <UNK> may , in a moment of <UNK> , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . 14.030538778938052
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 11.563872939472885
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . 12.340737854986237
I had no notion but he would go a <UNK> , or something or other , and not <UNK> us with his company . 13.673389311900598
Poor little Lizzy ! 10.325391776780775
Mr . Collins made his declaration in form . 8.444516346502505
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . 14.29459378801327
I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " " And they must marry ! 10.263188761038228
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all <UNK> , if she <UNK> more , and could have the advantage of a London master . 12.386198195119196
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 21.004641917025126
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be <UNK> . 10.434083113379325
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 13.824873410760047
They all <UNK> tables , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> . 53.36208519193557
He was well , but so much engaged with Mr . Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . 7.733747620821927
" Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . 8.428854096615535
From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . 11.098139038495983
Society has claims on us all ; and I <UNK> myself one of those who consider intervals of <UNK> and amusement as desirable for every body . " Elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak <UNK> to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from <UNK> a <UNK> either from the <UNK> , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by <UNK> to dance . 22.355026791919546
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . 9.282480751415141
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 15.597223181722384
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted , is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK> their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and <UNK> them earnestly . But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . inf
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 10.160512139891075
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that . 11.539812488712814
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 16.227550315091065
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . 10.392671101161897
This cannot be ! 6.200589673550953
Let Wickham be your man . 6.797381410161969
<UNK> are too much like <UNK> . 21.514748608096824
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . 15.272423608737036
" Not yet , " replied Jane . 5.377871646205785
In <UNK> lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <UNK> in this interference . 19.72961358272143
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <UNK> as these , what would have been her sensations ? 19.790773356546683
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 18.392066978768604
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 8.89864320202775
Pray , how violent was Mr . Bingley ' s love ? " " I never saw a more promising inclination . 11.663027184993718
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 9.244392955516446
and Mrs . 2.149296078465
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " Well , Jane , who is it from ? 11.610852039338617
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . 19.871949000743527
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <UNK> , distance becomes no evil . 27.122409728321173
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . 16.90517104643042
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . 21.050109197467908
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 12.699167613683635
The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 14.81936212214045
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to <UNK> this estate after the death of your honoured father , who , however , may live many years longer , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . 15.786484786840182
But , really , I know not what to say . 4.27838037708091
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 13.869019574223303
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , <UNK> my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " " It is well . 11.823095211466036
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy . 16.02698216054117
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 12.871861708208609
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . 13.102582459182834
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . " " If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . 15.031336209712272
She then took a large house in <UNK> street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . 28.631899017370603
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . 14.68709547856363
CHAPTER XV . 7.2234956205320096
Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 13.448791151076318
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 8.793873940980749
His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry <UNK> , his wife may teach him . 18.185426704586376
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . " Elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . 14.238619567046095
Collins was settled near her family . " " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . 9.908061155449687
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 18.31419472209886
And when you have given your ball , " she added , " I shall insist on their giving one also . 11.373501139341181
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 8.885016475538203
<UNK> , <UNK> , . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations . 33.09079057746304
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself . 8.30444377751785
Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ? 15.750666942045203
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be <UNK> so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . 17.441401349016765
Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . 20.367394547145352
Who are your uncles and <UNK> ? 21.296772437203774
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 15.065995574274389
What could be more natural than his asking you again ? 13.144122702890828
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 10.769431629656966
Their table was <UNK> stupid . 19.87283431557913
I shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will <UNK> and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " Elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 17.369609584082788
Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 13.002939835365996
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago . 19.89703556302494
I dare say he often <UNK> worse things said than I am going to say . 18.13779939399719
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 20.378128222690606
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with <UNK> all the <UNK> explanations . 21.41214323928196
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ? 14.29502839692133
I write without any intention of <UNK> you , or <UNK> myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the <UNK> , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . 15.53435628303471
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . 13.909502737850294
<UNK> there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or <UNK> . 25.316687268876997
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? 7.4824820263031935
She is well , and <UNK> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . Your ' s , c . 9.93784712847892
Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . 5.840323681882923
But I will not repine . 5.829470345071828
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 5.954991412746284
how I laughed ! 7.060241668513314
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 12.170668550884375
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . 13.881321905094879
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and <UNK> , though <UNK> families . 17.372015767123074
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to <UNK> the fruits of her own <UNK> offence . 22.021644068194682
That he has neither integrity nor honour . 17.430374623863983
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <UNK> . 14.334252767041933
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . 17.067476477979927
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . " Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . 15.1744354707465
" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living . 10.598263811539853
so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to every body . That is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . " " Did Charlotte dine with you ? " " No , she would go home . 21.13778365738858
" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech . 6.173930784127023
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . " Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . 17.942855956396826
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley ' s behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . 11.437194234567068
She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs . 6.318984701496585
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . Oh ! 19.83643254811416
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . 15.509012295855005

As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner ' s hope of Lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its <UNK> . 19.26623837161903
" Oh , Lizzy ! 4.3220735897464255
I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 9.513378658309495
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . 16.434249459005674
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . " " No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me . 10.261713530217659
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . 14.576312894833892
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 18.957721332542068
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . 9.424827067331154
" I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five <UNK> any object . 15.053293166706922
Oh , Lydia ! " " I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 8.64681241871984
What will you think of my vanity ? 8.768243112602324
I was uncomfortable enough . 5.317097003763414
In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 12.43453182570271
Your sweetness and <UNK> are really <UNK> ; I do not know what to say to you . 15.097070893355246
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies . 16.915607176132923
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 17.580691166770645
I did for you . 2.975353675135313
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of <UNK> whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to <UNK> , she began to regret that he came . 16.27896558112409
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 19.13566385379183
" She is my youngest girl but one . 7.8748290454953365
Elizabeth hoped she had <UNK> him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 12.760116668856186
She performed her part indeed without much <UNK> , but Mrs . 14.26562271701566
After a slight <UNK> for good news , the letter was read aloud . 16.848152923678317
" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said Mr . Gardiner . 7.306963273278576
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a <UNK> as this . 16.529663269825516
CHAPTER II . 6.996859120965737
Gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . 11.449820395320474
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . 10.375200546389186
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . 9.28239429860266
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <UNK> in the gaieties which that season generally <UNK> , and that your <UNK> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall <UNK> you . " " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . " " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . " " Why will you think so ? 19.08757902214533
<UNK> , stay , I will go myself . 8.370727816990273
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 22.03358414943155
CHAPTER XIV . 7.2234956205320096
I am glad he <UNK> here on Tuesday . 15.018740392010475
Have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs . 7.169954031267053
Good girl ! 9.237727545486205
Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . " CHAPTER XIII . 15.719373950487585
On entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . 20.714357383861206
At such a distance as that , you know , things are <UNK> misrepresented . " " Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips . 13.777947433569846
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . " Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . 12.488539869001684
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . 9.496131443834827
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <UNK> . 15.987574690151742
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . 17.134098535651983
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you ! 8.677777269723283
Her affections had been continually <UNK> , but never without an object . 19.576635091721418
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . 13.927342758569084
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 11.698765126906613
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 20.49406493708907
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <UNK> of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James ' s , with very decent composure . 24.56745967916583
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon . 18.99024537187218
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane . 14.071268422158855
It was to be such a secret ! " " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject . 7.674008337279283
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . 16.308736771840888
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent . 19.366591452567732
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 18.744505136701942
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . 11.78520078362264
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 16.165661253523446
" Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared . 8.336394689709929
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . 15.727736409702725
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 14.839002593318714
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs . 6.927335337485043
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it . 8.80785500642137
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very <UNK> to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . 9.633772809613188
Mr . Bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is <UNK> with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . " She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . 16.422910177814483
<UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill . 10.488865023692687
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . 9.810736399380685
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . 13.372082348674173
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! 9.445649464969515
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 18.181072327155686
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . " Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . 16.91468476569188
Allowing for the common <UNK> of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy . 11.891724361300358
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 18.10748490112085
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! 12.511313161221166
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you . 11.968289017031871
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . 17.831093698795556
" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried Jane . 13.124423517901034
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure . " The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs . 23.239924294009114
" It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . 9.389430691456278
I will not tell you what it is . 4.791341193674952
They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . 10.621446137716749
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which were scattered over the <UNK> lawn . 44.210518831028004
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention . 14.609517943641585
" He only told me , what I have now told you . " Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart <UNK> with indignation . 10.621468334501827

" When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! I who knew what he was . 9.05702191664115
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 14.337970769981084
It was then <UNK> in the following manner . 10.548808565949365
In the dining room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before . 19.926175020538796
Heaven forbid ! 13.126927883343464
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this <UNK> recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy ! 16.426136858664577
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . 18.314096447429737
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 11.74352515351168
It <UNK> , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . 20.88671523091172
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him . 18.266059892186334
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs . 9.840122937115286
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs . 16.522449596630043
Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . 3.9013695493886
I am so grieved for him . 5.535029379442102
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . 11.616157040230297
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs . 7.479350601766997
They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <UNK> <UNK> and head <UNK> there is not much the matter with me . 23.63218831724013
Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! 7.627572027919368
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 10.912017910117296
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew . 7.423456711633559
These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 14.935204924052192
<UNK> as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . 17.820496275791513
" It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . 11.466749428937469
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . 6.379794990495548
I am not at all afraid of her dying . 6.741354883362471
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of Darcy ' s . " " Oh ! 11.589154283258107
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 18.849596603270665
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . 17.819998932798267
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it . 11.617646062433828
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 16.40518739067828
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 10.78609732069341
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 17.944978234539263
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s <UNK> name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father ' s estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think . 17.74051128750869
<UNK> me in silence . 9.112053136645597
It would be such a <UNK> scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . 14.888680450474864
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 13.717144921204818
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 13.012265080346666
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and <UNK> of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their <UNK> . 24.134647340508863
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you . 10.430076856445922
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips . 22.90201537159978
Elizabeth longed to <UNK> its <UNK> ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . 18.952735917439746
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . 17.992723961268627
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . 13.941895967997006
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 13.892683593064257
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! 11.769026883531389
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 17.961718336088857
CHAPTER VIII . 7.2234956205320096
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My <UNK> were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte . 15.146515582198013
Is not general incivility the very <UNK> of love ? " " Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . 13.06179848878956
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 16.754846861501353
And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined . 13.667381410829975
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " <UNK> in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . 14.043968902017712
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 17.150369565935883
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . 11.709834358212513
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . " " My dear , you flatter me . 9.980993845199551
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . " " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . 15.570535843751987
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " " Ten thousand pounds ! 11.799477664698038
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . " Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . 6.086820468231516
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . " " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " " Has your governess left you ? " " We never had any governess . " " No governess ! 18.448275180130217

Thank Heaven ! 12.51087044269883
Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other . 8.692043172046922
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . " This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . 16.188146627012078
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . 9.619149147414445
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . 10.005633762368198
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> . 10.261196945838234
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the <UNK> on guard , and dressing a <UNK> and <UNK> . 35.612823825466045
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , <UNK> every chance of <UNK> himself by marrying well ? 22.79259708227095
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 13.69080985923565
You will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . " He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit <UNK> long . 14.446051936467919
" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . 9.372396510397543
" You quite <UNK> Mr . Darcy . 7.41301167913169
" Oh ! 3.731104652284054
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <UNK> infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . 23.450230636146312
But vanity , not love , has been my folly . <UNK> with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . 15.710823195983817
" If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs . 8.791704926062101
His character was decided . 7.813049624134755
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 20.049375379177373
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 15.177906714754716
She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . 37.947026449031576
Four nieces of Mrs . 8.26721272053212
The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . 15.167664365357918
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . 13.646230875526056
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 10.201911794148579
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s <UNK> . 19.059434821869818
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long <UNK> . " Mrs . 12.461017895953498
" Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 13.380896091148678
During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <UNK> , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . 17.577581765049995
" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance . 12.132318642637458
But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he <UNK> that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 13.509851215040577
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 7.968262188587946
Good bye . 8.16715252097151
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . 26.2827089358354
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 14.166494413550149
But you are always giving her the preference . " " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . " " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? 14.329925507082528
It is what every body says . 8.961367072714033
It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ? 20.049381005270018
You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not . 6.723986872290382
The journey would moreover give her a <UNK> at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . 13.532924672303663
Pray read on . " " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she <UNK> so disgraceful a match . 18.051979051643382
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . 10.373400782890252
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . 16.598256700303352
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate . 21.43367397804192
It originated in Mrs . 6.6795104158824525
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well . 10.549947010150534
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 7.2542856255091035
Long . 3.6213039172052595
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can ' t write ; so I will <UNK> , and you write for me . 11.055711882423521
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it <UNK> . 13.985355258771369
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . 8.206752632625584
Her mother ' s <UNK> , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . 15.286026132755106
Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . " " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . 12.131655752785752
" I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could . 6.183442186560192
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . 15.801170772814388
" How <UNK> have I acted ! " she cried . " I , who have <UNK> myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! 17.280264506605874
She certainly did not hate him . 8.21835071038591
CHAPTER XVII . 7.2234956205320096
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please . 10.946995417418636
<UNK> will be absolutely <UNK> , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . 20.666699503893383
" I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel <UNK> ' s regiment went away . 12.494330206992979
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . 12.168214036811712
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . 14.685480088669133
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . 13.278326104657085
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . 10.653477101125379
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 11.744685650165048
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him . 35.27103363387648
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 18.21202857041291
Miss Bennet had <UNK> ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . 11.219346891437711
<UNK> or twice she could discern a <UNK> blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . 33.06667967018144
I can hardly write for laughing . 9.565068257260231
CHAPTER VII . 7.22349596044539
CHAPTER XIX . 7.2234956205320096
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 18.3097488250004
Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . 14.177474227876605
<UNK> an only son , for many years an only child I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , my father particularly , all that was <UNK> and amiable , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and <UNK> , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . 21.583902303207136
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 10.497829011615813
The Miss <UNK> all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . Do you draw ? " " No , not at all . " " What , none of you ? " " Not one . " " That is very strange . 11.197355899618598
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 7.102262463687285
Jane <UNK> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour . 11.560384454065465
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . 16.584090190849096
No , no , you shall not deceive me . 6.301771064825793
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . 23.821384501137786
What did Colonel Forster say ? 13.281066746302146
Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . " Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . 14.522761873327122
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence . 15.66916321433857
Her colour changed , and she said no more . 8.328419466786974
Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . 13.406178213808127
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
The express was sent off directly . 12.722326245390692
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . " Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . 16.533390529431557
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . 10.097210240908213
She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <UNK> him with fears and regrets in <UNK> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 14.09541932338451
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . 13.916033913681376
I shall be back by dinner . " " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . 14.943089672787378
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with . 11.442731741162625
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 20.44127522835029
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions . 18.757135166087103
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 19.412435860730767
They have at least that advantage . " " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . 11.49412078146129
I remain , dear sir , with <UNK> compliments to your lady and daughters , your well <UNK> and friend , <UNK> <UNK> . " " At four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he <UNK> up the letter . 21.356216031870318
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others . 15.303186661446858
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months . 23.88799193446933
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F . 8.034966307294978
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
It cannot be concealed from any one . 8.91942683139588
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 8.109382750698614
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 11.82626343043331
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . 16.689917019819884
Your ' s , very sincerely , " <UNK> . 8.10893600971381
Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . 9.902820761798068
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 12.894549195125741
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 16.08861448896914
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . 9.132216199747354
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . 10.184915160464287
Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs . 7.487718990665638
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . 16.542417571770418
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 17.910905320522545
" He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . 16.18843169389816
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . 18.576806207055476
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 10.269431249332046
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . 11.742649226380275
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished <UNK> of integrity or benevolence , that might <UNK> him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the <UNK> of virtue , atone for those <UNK> errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . 28.130598600160642
When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . 14.288966671146476
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church . 14.365600734138171
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <UNK> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 18.48269582110769
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . 12.834001185055989
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 21.897061915957792
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more <UNK> purpose . 12.802812550732728
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . 16.726789728826393
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your ' s seems to have been . 14.843185018224176
" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 8.748870671030398
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Mr . Robinson . " " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? 16.99372981240141
Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " This walk is not wide enough for our party . 14.065756515948209
They then went away . 7.5054383576857795
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . 14.153701322274173
What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! 12.199156237820945
Now is your time . 6.171208196570246
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 15.149377314060686
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 26.851896003469516
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 22.217963863797845
This was agreed to , and Mrs . 4.359041915915219
Forster and me are such friends ! and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? 15.028462680561121
You know my sentiments . " " You are then resolved to have him ? " " I have said no such thing . 8.270858110241766
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 16.809987746925152
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 10.419661239464777
I told my sister Philips so the other day . 7.967304364985603
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 8.580314797958712
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . " " I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want . " " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " No , indeed . 9.463389586496666
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . 17.997467958565803
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 13.336171557535623
" Kitty and I are going <UNK> to sit in my dressing room . " Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room . 15.743557128396256
Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . 15.133404431686428
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels . 23.162404608003325
Elizabeth did all she could , to <UNK> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 16.00625320141309
What say you , Mary ? 6.877636632419472
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . 17.224353550183206
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . 16.994044841330478
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . 10.391174632612339
He now wished it more than ever . 8.479190301781891
" You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . 5.681985210672819
" I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ' s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . 12.50773652720777
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 9.5128851313596
But enough of this . 3.9524768141025977
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . " " Oh ! 11.609421206578446
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 19.839188043201887
She saw herself the object of attention , to <UNK> and to <UNK> of them at present unknown . 13.129539770369929
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . 13.78991927017335
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? " Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . 12.868366472086993
I know your disposition , Lizzy . 5.42770076656004
Mr . Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . 11.540793055427585
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 14.851596748905383
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time . 12.070227349242646
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us . 17.635673471306866
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling <UNK> on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give . 19.319769106577468
As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it <UNK> and lovely as ever . 17.133851344743523
Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . 14.70771489093747
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and Mrs . 16.453413237674827
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . " <UNK> ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 14.943796114961529
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took <UNK> in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 14.622253849329198
Mr . what ' s his name . 4.643007756010076

Only look at her . 6.381804787892275
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 22.439894920359293
She saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . 17.047405574928217
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a <UNK> , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , <UNK> to Kitty and Lydia . 20.673207606445523
Let me do it without farther loss of time . 11.239763619713273
He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia . 12.787820018745697
" I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . 7.192261030879894
Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . 10.981673645204298
Oh , brother , how kind you are ! 7.163580007359779
CHAPTER IV . 7.223496220938243
Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . 8.664538957235957
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to <UNK> , and was but slightly affected by his <UNK> of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the <UNK> altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh . 24.415120799363372
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . 14.257247633648303
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle . 9.233781379163942
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added <UNK> to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be <UNK> . 19.727786977781687
it cannot be . 3.139901063111217
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 12.408073858856781
These were the contents " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . 20.759203833123255
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . 16.45750517932312
A fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . 11.791257485365662
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 17.528600649234896
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 20.927493303041395
. 1.3860752889566952
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . 13.556450142674462
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 19.148235593010572
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 13.999531705114105
I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too . 5.658394350158112
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . 14.301605818943129
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill <UNK> of Lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . 20.35938021695335
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . 18.419582288538045
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 8.811830665074064
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 19.656322174026158
Her hair so <UNK> , so <UNK> ! " " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six <UNK> deep in <UNK> , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . " " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . 20.99609067030342
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day <UNK> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . 16.033880042059838
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . 13.924337813586185
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 11.01255579896663
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . 16.21301196970845
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <UNK> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 31.580128071819075
Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general <UNK> , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . 16.34162178428477
The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . 16.014064934922562
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her . 13.448788000466939
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 17.51157542513104
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . 13.370655674426645
