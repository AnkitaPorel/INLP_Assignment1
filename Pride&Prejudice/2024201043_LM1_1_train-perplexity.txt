<UNK> requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much <UNK> and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements . 2259.6051207463806
Sir William did not say much . 499.33812381554986
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . 979.396185431526
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 4136.7955348183705
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . 1032.1786261971647
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy ' s regard . " " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? " " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . " " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy . 1475.0260265737224
He can be a <UNK> companion if he thinks it worth his while . 4320.366822975807
I know how much you dislike him . " " You know nothing of the matter . 1353.3110229055999
" I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the <UNK> and public places . 1455.7733967668237
Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . 1606.1522234808665
And now here ' s Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 2302.0047689847106
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . " " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose . 3110.757761261558
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . 3140.230429388213
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done . 1307.1403733656448
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 1720.0224912570313
" It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . 935.2140905991014
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 1633.8547525046627
We do not suffer by accident . 3853.495963793421
Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 750.0738573873172
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 1154.945278629111
" You write uncommonly fast . " " You are mistaken . 2860.9907389598748
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 1837.2157518009412
" I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . 1462.9992816722952
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 2070.7279078645265
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . 1539.359721454114
No , no I feel he may defy us there . 1789.0899958978948
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . 3191.25222691327
At such a distance as that , you know , things are <UNK> misrepresented . " " Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips . 3175.3698973297187
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 2554.012896316603
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle . 1734.7882745314432
I have a high respect for your nerves . 3030.875863200158
Gardiner smiled . 651.7472855234904
We have heard nothing from town . " " Dear madam , " cried Mrs . 1243.7378786239883
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . " " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 1901.316607311018
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage . 2990.9712703784307
It seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary <UNK> , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . 1861.4138673077696
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . " " My beauty you had early <UNK> , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . 2313.2163016492736
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . " " I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which <UNK> in <UNK> a respectable man . 2338.9697640155914
I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . 2134.403004006372
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few <UNK> , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <UNK> . " Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 1337.1873799189314
Section . 2975.9492055808505
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . 2432.2540249046538
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . " " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be <UNK> beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen . 2359.416337530841
' Tis as good as a Lord ! 2412.5223243317596
His character was decided . 1998.3594697992392
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . 1997.9158578403305
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her . 1254.7274856184144
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious <UNK> , denoted a recollection of Jane , not <UNK> by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . 1948.7588247792833
" Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 1821.0519992676645
She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . 3441.0635639860698
He leaves out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <UNK> . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must <UNK> reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility . 2077.888150946694
<UNK> inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in <UNK> ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the <UNK> Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . 1956.2329035290406
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . 1586.8690064318707
Did you see it ? " Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . 1883.408827471529
Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to <UNK> . 1604.4466320391193
" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . 1800.8101779263725
But with me , it is not so . 7335.670239776667
Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 1110.1161504169906
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . 1529.2052824960897
where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without <UNK> a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . 1949.7979095229184
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . 1450.0156413261398
But Mrs . 1133.6359062803915
" Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . " She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . 1860.1463581123958
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . 2124.0431944014613
I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . 1333.6083650343817
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . 2442.3613172687005
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out . She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . 1651.448231599613
To his <UNK> engagement with Miss De Bourgh ? 1345.2260101793286
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . 1141.343514843456
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . 2378.4642335872313
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . 2075.643781642274
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . 1302.5026155433877
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . 2236.751651767055
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 1852.0234148456332
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . " " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " " Has your governess left you ? " " We never had any governess . " " No governess ! 2165.47925587718
" You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 2098.3769748122145
<UNK> for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public <UNK> , but I wrote to Mr . Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs . 1289.8242546516772
I will try again . 4532.145697697574
Elizabeth , after slightly <UNK> it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . 2063.164011155857
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious . 2631.2923655248333
She had got rid of two of the <UNK> which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . 2015.789761901002
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day <UNK> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . 2433.924375734587
" He seems to be a most <UNK> and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so <UNK> as to let him come to us again . " " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . " " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . " Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of <UNK> , marrying , and <UNK> his <UNK> whenever it were required . 1943.6191619684241
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . 1808.8354693266297
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr . Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent . 1785.8667853200766
But there are two things that I want very much to know one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . " " <UNK> ! 2088.020124824097
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley . 1671.9455540487527
It must be his own doing . He is his own master . 3590.8908266534336
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . " Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs . 1765.387205954717
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . " " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . 1486.8465418262688
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 2481.9533857088613

A most welcome negative followed the last question and her <UNK> being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 1864.2941795245258
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . " " You may depend upon it , Madam , " said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , " that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . " Mrs . 963.7988617540362
Lydia ' s going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . 2099.7943665367634
Its business office is located at North <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , . 3994.9110189227963
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 1828.625665335126
That is all settled . " " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . 3221.397398576753
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . 1056.1606348857429
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . 1681.2737135953498
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <UNK> shewn . 2440.747042793204
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . 1705.2629474329865
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . 5123.239514406376
It is unaccountable ! 5854.527928744069
When the ladies were <UNK> for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> . 2203.059056164585
Their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse . 1776.0510253064258
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <UNK> them . 914.7216969898456
Good bye . 1682.0614853510092
If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was <UNK> done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . With respect to that other , more <UNK> <UNK> , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only <UNK> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 2516.9637802644006
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 2528.8381047740286
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room . 1488.4453121804852
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . 2224.934185387852
" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . 1356.6903763400735
" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . 3099.8482753205994
I shall go distracted . " This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . 1632.7868380834407
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley is not he ? 1026.082459666932
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . 1723.7003722999273
Had it been your uncle ' s doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . 1481.8908891827753
Mr . Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the <UNK> and go to sleep . 1750.175708045212
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . 2160.1693575860195
Jenkinson , who lives with them . 4242.342968656166
" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . " " Is my father in town ? " " Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . " " And have you heard from him often ? " " We have heard only once . 1950.9722267142786
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . " Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . 1689.7610811721936
<UNK> , wretched , mistake ! " Darcy made no answer . 1420.2908354791687
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished . 2170.509794670331
Your ' s , c . 4712.876884153107
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be <UNK> to you to let them go alone . " " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " " Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . 2220.4423989844418
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . 1909.9205730060444
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . 2544.5697127847598
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . " " Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly . 1923.750844580025
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 1373.567507237353

I am sure you must feel it so . " " Oh ! 1729.2041650946248
But who was your mother ? 3294.979098038877
He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . " " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . 2611.532185955687
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 1421.9148761002934
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . 2340.6749064892456
" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of <UNK> in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ' s regard for me . 2237.487043429976
" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs . 1380.028262337248
I hope they will not meet at all . 2916.7437115527405
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " CHAPTER <UNK> . 2528.586574903501
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . 1185.2497706588376
" I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends . 1630.1243640470257
" I never heard any thing so abominable . 1124.2308692576137
" There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London . 2027.8780939834344
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . " Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . 1762.3458377967431
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for <UNK> him also with Lizzy . 1118.8142575830936
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him . 1174.7610751839106
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 1499.8728581954913
Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? 2156.091122223739
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be <UNK> to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a <UNK> nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . 2287.1159002979143

Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . 1303.3753071823794
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their <UNK> concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 3132.3153966342124
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 1660.999132990159
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . 1440.1616575826447
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 1366.632885085194
From what can it proceed ? 5549.845375844229
Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a <UNK> to buy clothes for his daughter . 1606.7180715876198
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs . 1852.9837972425064
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . 1166.408199336143
But does not Jane <UNK> with the sister ? 2144.3419998402655
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s <UNK> name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father ' s estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think . 1828.2197962710445
I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . 2170.0867350708727
A most delightful place ! <UNK> Parsonage House ! 1934.342450218132
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 1829.6951004344542
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . 1792.1527823302883
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . 961.2499081600275
Long . 2104.3138637329384
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . " Elizabeth was distressed . 1253.0402921561697
And one of my own daughters . 1887.2725934171476
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due . " " My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . 2485.606391603211
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . 1825.0587485427525
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 1609.4742085267278
Perhaps I am not doing her justice . 3584.5058420103137
But your family owe me nothing . 1352.2379090346474
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . 1995.344422985574

The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added <UNK> to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be <UNK> . 1935.7867249358594
And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined . 2008.6329575873701
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 1315.692675201752
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . " " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . 1881.316918445563
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! 2168.0092432300385
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 1842.8221371430134
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <UNK> . 933.9812155846345
" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . 1154.924554516112
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 1793.6871762579287
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> ! 2514.3488293141922
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . " " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . 2124.06379238568
<UNK> and <UNK> support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg tm ' s <UNK> and <UNK> that the Project Gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come . 1750.8900527321243
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . 1822.8521275974715
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 1263.5300934104419
Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ? 1450.470053824608
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . 1135.2960555374736
They were natural and just . 4436.271520596287
We must not all expect Jane ' s good fortune . " " True , " said Mr . Bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may <UNK> you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . " Mr . Wickham ' s society was of material service in <UNK> the gloom , which the late <UNK> occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family . 1560.6635240671164
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 1111.2622669046664
People do not die of little trifling <UNK> . 2407.018683695411
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 1389.5525966042499
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley . 1690.404237313958
Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 1850.6190735235282
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very <UNK> <UNK> for Netherfield were got by <UNK> . 2323.4767776402286
" My dear <UNK> , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of <UNK> each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s t te t te between two women can never end without a quarrel . 2252.440578489946
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . 656.2759619431682
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 1874.0922681053437
Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? 1082.7437811538782
When they repaired to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 1285.3336121290806
Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other . 1778.0367514707636
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay . 1692.6933900241343
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their <UNK> , <UNK> , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty ' s and Lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it . 2969.9944151891473
Her ladyship ' s carriage is <UNK> ordered for us . 1993.7086169904833
Darcy may be guessed . 593.437525257385
But you know married women have never much time for writing . 508.6375281018759
It is highly improper . 3098.7652914288537
Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , <UNK> him I believe very early in life . 1460.9975699331253
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 1628.0746982877665
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! 1369.4864739861985
I am so grieved for him . 5142.579470715093
Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 2065.859328373519
Besides , it will not much signify what one <UNK> this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . " " Are they indeed ? " cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . 1899.6049073191984
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . " " You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . 1312.1874875661538
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 2022.291347701101
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . 1553.542508391878
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did . 1150.372930511338
" Wickham so very bad ! 1957.1028955393433
She declared her resolution . 2388.155148876181
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . " " I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 1984.888347968365
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 2774.106629140011
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 1197.6362917631654
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 2168.5674750341977
His debts are to be paid , <UNK> , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased . 2370.617562507216
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . 4242.834405563216
<UNK> as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . 2102.546527919223
One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! 2402.6997043885053
Elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . 1167.4991435807917
CHAPTER VI . 1263.0515403986196
But the case is this . 4177.217625728401
He does not want abilities . 2868.0562596939585
Without a governess you must have been neglected . " " <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . 2212.88126922028
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 2597.7139792769162
" Oh ! 1745.268895136781
But I know the foundation is unjust . 2486.1698826193297
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . 1908.1717294182404
For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently . 1468.6715548768263
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 1693.7457524973197
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? 2254.9678924681766
" This is wholly unexpected . 3013.7238074934467
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . 1435.186784650203
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . 2230.7874485201105
Lizzy <UNK> she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . " " And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems an hopeless business . " " <UNK> to Lizzy about it yourself . 2330.380542304899
" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any <UNK> , rather adds to your other perfections . 2361.5978647304837
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . " " I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . " " Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . " " That is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . 2457.3269372277828
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . 2706.367070242264
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most . 1733.7987208615714
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill <UNK> of Lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . 2569.61633980289
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <UNK> to her <UNK> , afforded no <UNK> of her distress . 2013.6083694544568
Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 1236.085563385934
But Georgiana would not join her . 1351.9901102274844
It is impossible that he should still love me . " After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on <UNK> their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water <UNK> , there <UNK> to be a little alteration . 2230.5487046744265
Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . 1946.9359695830483
Long will do any such thing . 2411.4143187538184
Let her go then . 1549.71678045452
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 1737.4749577014982
The day passed much as the day before had done . 792.4810468299085
This will never do . " " You need not distress yourself . 3049.6941735965006
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 1494.335708618111
A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . 957.813777632327
After a short pause , her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me . 2769.416371492697
She would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house . " Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer . 1152.049583320627
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 1310.0095144508869
Every thing that is charming ! 1151.2451894710991
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 1451.9537010390986
are sufficiently known . 1783.928257589185
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of <UNK> was delightful to her , and she began her song . 2240.6484041453896
Collins so before you came . 1485.90264098192
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side . 1982.2129525365485
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . " Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less <UNK> of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too <UNK> by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . 1993.6363459830477
The moral will be perfectly fair . 2236.6464429014122
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many <UNK> of that nature . 1954.487541287731
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
They are wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? " " They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . " " But if you have got them to day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered . " She did at last <UNK> from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . 2311.5597020294467
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 3250.4937217763722
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . " " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 1621.1403672657266
I will read you the passage which particularly <UNK> me . 3389.185130292045
Her mother <UNK> <UNK> , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 2211.297866330493
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 1998.3399838765035
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild <UNK> , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character . 2096.9991906396585
Mr . Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . 1493.6519995592982
" I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham . 1719.6310437206037
<UNK> are settled so <UNK> . " " You <UNK> perhaps to the entail of this estate . " " Ah ! 3624.0065952802
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . 1725.3061097182053
Have a little compassion on my nerves . 2231.683776991988
I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . " Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . 1521.7666807037267
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . 1673.9652719099377
Elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 1121.9305536868856
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . 2218.393042098827
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 2144.5949319805627
Bennet , who <UNK> with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be <UNK> enough . 2268.5177230550603
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . 2437.689977305799
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern <UNK> , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . 1944.3358202774277
CHAPTER XII . 1263.0515403986196
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments . 2457.8653928269
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . 2157.9346058626866
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . 1552.2712498651078
Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . 1380.4374639669074
She had no fear of its <UNK> farther , through his means . 3147.104213105908
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . 1044.3242611212431
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . " " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . " " Pride , " observed Mary , who <UNK> herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe . 2427.536784618311
Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . 1545.8114953833024
Is not he a charming man ? 2345.0110022968083
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ' s visit . 986.3450548717501
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 1919.3643676722938
CHAPTER XVII . 1263.0515403986196
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . 2210.1383680839936
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried . 1206.858163142393
CHAPTER XI . 1263.0515403986196
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only <UNK> off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . " When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . 1431.089754954556
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uncle Philips , <UNK> <UNK> wine , who followed them into the room . 1961.6734090077762
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! " cried Elizabeth when she had finished it . 1637.3136091951496
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " I have just received your letter , and shall <UNK> this whole morning to answering it , as I <UNK> that a little writing will not <UNK> what I have to tell you . 2711.3818872994743
We seem to have been designed for each other . " Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she <UNK> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . 1818.6865144725496
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 2377.1349166225755
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 1292.4549959332478
Any other inconsistencies with modern <UNK> have been left as printed . 3705.928060104014
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <UNK> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . 2194.8073845401454
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 1469.2615238941855
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 1495.0910332320773
And a special licence . 4878.0251097345945

There is a mixture of <UNK> and self importance in his letter , which promises well . 2259.195556986729
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . 2063.010763164372
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <UNK> , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . 2753.0646840098384
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
How he lived I know not . 2304.2606885026685
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <UNK> . 2109.922506733014
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . 1188.124266605056
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . 1688.0404280919124
CHAPTER IX . 1263.0515403986196
my dear , " continued Mrs . 895.7545353867997
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . 2791.6001873166247
Collins was settled near her family . " " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . 1868.877414145115
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <UNK> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . 1049.3243790753527
You have delighted us long enough . 623.8102750893607
She had high <UNK> spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . 2055.77708098992
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . 1489.368727813979
Sir William had been delighted with him . 1815.275538069271
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States . 2551.151585563067
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . 1830.443073709864
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some <UNK> neighbour , who could not be enough <UNK> , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 1518.9437228328802
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . " " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . 1511.469947929074
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . 1287.501332116303
It was really a very handsome thought . 1480.0421594531708
That tall , proud man . " " Good gracious ! 1827.2317889232816
To Mr . Bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 1923.234730883044
I had hoped that our sentiments <UNK> in every particular , but I must so far <UNK> from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . " " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . 1519.1539474554522
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . 1760.822260165135
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs . 1151.680535593189
In such an <UNK> my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I <UNK> upon his goodness . " " Oh ! 1593.2418404493587
Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously . " Mrs . 1655.8154565041618
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . 3028.525452136221
You are not going to be <UNK> , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . 3164.51475768961
They may be <UNK> and printed and given away you may do <UNK> <UNK> with public domain eBooks . 1643.5973519611355
No sentiment of shame gave a <UNK> to her triumph . 2679.3452135765046
Yet he knew to the contrary himself . 2400.116884349872
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " As Mrs . 1827.627983255932
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . 1387.3388698020235
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . 1453.3633149752734
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . 1527.0236959933852
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her <UNK> of Mrs . 2159.2651367275175
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia ' s leaving home . 1704.5485753204673
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 1949.1007534340845
" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be <UNK> , for <UNK> I must call it . " " It is wonderful , " replied Wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 2239.4455874767214
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . 2572.39430262601
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted , is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK> their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and <UNK> them earnestly . But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . 2314.570151455845
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it . 1428.859576122005
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away . 1143.0067544753197
I am prodigiously proud of him . 3913.204439102994
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . 1017.917589922405
It is what every body says . 1265.8420176537788
Bingley and talked of Mrs . 591.1847755551115
Her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 1187.2359141232057
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , <UNK> , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . 1942.934605838545
Well , but now for my news it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? 2522.2965548330367
" Well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? 2292.554484749555
" The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . 2177.137922232926
c . " Mr . Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . 1438.4222525522773
You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! 1657.77330836603
She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . 2482.4693209560232
She was going to the <UNK> ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of <UNK> , just fit to be killed . " Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . 2257.2714565209058
It is admirable ! " Elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 1543.6681727027533
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . 1460.9525421694193
She was busily <UNK> through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . 1877.4982492470824
It was all conjecture . " " What is it you mean ? " " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing . " " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . " " And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . 1990.2422058117195
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . 2306.97092808553
where is your <UNK> my dear ? " But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 1418.5602798927082
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <UNK> , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 1734.8523713674203
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . 964.5332698673656
It is a pity they are not handsome ! 3791.3788094737597
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 1302.8715237488857
CHAPTER IV . 1263.0515403986196
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . 2472.2594317814714
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 2154.1424656691943
She is grown so <UNK> and <UNK> ! 5892.561630568206
I write rather slowly . " " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! 1420.164702002385
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
. <UNK> . The copyright laws of the place where you are located also <UNK> what you can do with this work . 3189.9444494036597
But that is not the case here . 4761.664554313593
I depend on you for that . " To these high <UNK> expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the <UNK> of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . 1981.7002442786495
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . 1248.934419925853
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been <UNK> from the world , in some distant farm house . 1564.3492290455847
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . 2216.1969068349204
I shall see her in January . 1499.8762002139943
" It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . 678.1536421925081
Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . 967.8557082621626
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . " " I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 2089.4376600701166
Lydia was Lydia still ; <UNK> , <UNK> , wild , noisy , and <UNK> . 2272.8984984800404
My dear Charles , what do you mean ? " " Yes , all of them , I think . 2626.43326682015
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . 5048.455616494066
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . 1623.4207239430068
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the <UNK> light , seemed most improbable . 2358.892673999873
Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day . 893.1429012838702
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . 1965.4407295765493
only think ! 1332.9406563636512
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . 1396.7697296937895
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . 898.6854047837136
There is no indignity so <UNK> to their feelings ! " She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " " And quite alone ? 2315.122730494774
Your <UNK> makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a <UNK> . " " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! 2826.3466804977543
" I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth . 761.9086353776542
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <UNK> , distance becomes no evil . 2238.810990078898
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 2257.312028561199
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so doubtful , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea . 2438.2986094704584
I told my sister Philips so the other day . 1189.2639937381816
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . 1600.2794007995437
<UNK> felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . 1806.6268581145523
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> . 1718.1531764179167
My affections and wishes are <UNK> , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . " Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very <UNK> , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . 1920.2437575082047
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia . 1447.4447058103513
" Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . 1550.8428246360309
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s . 2921.715258771272
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . 2811.593906039217
She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 3029.832556465544
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . 1825.891566799867
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <UNK> <UNK> necessary . 1258.7424034839457
. F . . F . . Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees <UNK> considerable effort to <UNK> , do copyright research on , <UNK> and <UNK> public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg tm collection . 1794.8792262096347
If , indeed , it should be so ! 4520.714354851558
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . 2267.912362280526
She answered him with cold civility . 1712.78521273307
<UNK> in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . 1827.3143657758653
You must learn some of my philosophy . 2101.8566241114777
Mr . Darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . 1019.4971402402413
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . 998.6903570244096
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <UNK> every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were <UNK> abroad . 1801.5918271877745
He was received by Mrs . 1403.0654746087873
Wickham is safe . " " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . " " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane . 1664.108901987906
When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs . 1223.158856739635
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . 1590.3645534694701
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate . 2453.790154011021
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . 1904.6889387858698
" A <UNK> ! " she cried . 4188.895839654696
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 1533.4287283956035
I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 1962.5077484649028
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . <UNK> are never of so much consequence to a father . 1313.9567073566425
He now wished it more than ever . 2502.506173134692
She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 1923.4652309238386
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . 1860.5229486634498
Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . 2130.3983339847
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . " Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . 1564.3720062537334
But it was a hope shortly checked by other <UNK> , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . 2049.838362499076
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? " A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and <UNK> and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . 1968.1675779369293
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 1535.1813496813174
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very <UNK> in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . 1213.282809636426
" You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . 723.5524499993757
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . 2609.428423618122
" Do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; " that is rather singular . " " Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " <UNK> cards . 1476.0382506717615
The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 1064.2158597905257
With many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs . 2318.0611127640996
He is come Mr . Bingley is come . He is , indeed . 1153.6178490579089
III . 3764.3110762416654
And do you really love him quite well enough ? 695.4614753583627
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 1541.02585098895
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday . 1834.9882947882033
Her mind was less difficult to <UNK> . 1883.8377631741198
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . 3025.8930785294133
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 862.2110584648859
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . 914.2770852655054
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? 2076.548269568795
" Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . 1278.4916773481798
Jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all . 1719.4016222272305
" What can be the meaning of this ! " said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone . 2309.238525171117
" I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five <UNK> any object . 1864.961252952768
Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better . 435.4136928475551
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . 734.4625137102578
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . 2050.9833306749188
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up . 639.8727472295292
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . 1583.0650488253514
Philips ' s <UNK> was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs . 1584.9642990487293
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . 2080.2389881334648
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? 2225.844001014207
" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . 3399.6111695558448
no it is not for me to be driven away by Mr . Darcy . 1998.5009083638415
" They will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . 1982.4912705946854
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 2233.527338285757
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a <UNK> . 1988.0158973518357
Now is your time . 2610.608581042093
We now come to the point . 2257.674953378093
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 1997.245387517151
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " I saw you look at me to day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . 1305.58055368818
" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried Jane . 1405.3942999772585
The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who <UNK> it , were familiar to them . 3663.592875151118
Her hair so <UNK> , so <UNK> ! " " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six <UNK> deep in <UNK> , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . " " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . 2823.5252283156747
But there was still something <UNK> behind , of which prudence <UNK> the <UNK> . 3053.3957644353945
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . 2772.957517829642
" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the <UNK> <UNK> above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <UNK> than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . 2274.97091972186
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission . 1566.8356044588074
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 1542.0956980594378
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> . 1331.7929101147643
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell <UNK> to mend a great <UNK> in my worked muslin gown , before they are <UNK> up . 1978.1773804404306
I was never more <UNK> ! 3054.1976122753063
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 2658.8873957989454
Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . 1554.4278549971384
Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 1966.528712227898
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they <UNK> with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy . 1653.0518246392157
why did she come ? 3091.6904109858947
He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . 2008.4043152066347
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . 2232.8413121679814
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . 1103.089208554376
<UNK> of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . " Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready <UNK> . 1424.842770080188
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 2681.12752772324
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . 1819.5621483418145
" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . 2008.2954842045792
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did . 2998.9731243123424
" Kitty and I are going <UNK> to sit in my dressing room . " Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room . 1539.831051034943
Her <UNK> are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . 1999.518345794699
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
" I am sorry it went off . 2779.531582848827
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . 2733.160307010312
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . 618.1667126150935
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 1880.227415509447
" For my own part , " she <UNK> , " I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . 1830.587493370033
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 1926.9535086914805
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one <UNK> in it an object of compassion , while they are <UNK> of our intimacy at Rosings . " <UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> . 2406.21281519018
The pain of separation , however , might be <UNK> on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . 1831.4159526725919
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good <UNK> engaged Mr . Collins ' s conversation to herself . 1064.6511482576439
Mr . Collins received and returned these <UNK> with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <UNK> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 1710.9510982649308
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! 2317.216339156714
It will save me a world of trouble and economy . 2810.7222483522205
I do not trust my own partiality . 3747.934889273071
He placed himself by her . 5096.89975239007
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you . 1845.5470112811488
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 2021.6133716790805
We passed each other several times . 1693.1392489061
Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . 1648.4591259461681
<UNK> ' s note <UNK> and <UNK> changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book . 3226.7941107369816
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
I thought I should have broke my heart . " " I am sure I shall break mine , " said Lydia . 1569.7359740397198
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 1346.1157041193298
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in <UNK> to the proposal before him . 1752.3021774319513
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! 1174.9934317613186
Our poor mother is sadly grieved . 1338.9295149523205
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of <UNK> from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a <UNK> horse . 3365.570108994202
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . 1276.2297521515666
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . 2404.6386602618995
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s t te t te with Mrs . 1739.6737562489025
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 2214.533810090904
I shall never forget her appearance this morning . 691.9391127732102
Bennet ' s <UNK> was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter . 1280.766997588988
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a <UNK> ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 1725.9927651438963
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 2200.3497106590858
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <UNK> her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 1595.0463173135636
Thank Heaven ! 1925.479739131712
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . 2728.049253185687
' Ah ! 4367.0471708180075
Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . 2423.760617417798
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . 2431.2868175732915
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago . " " I have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said Mrs . 1579.4122643804424
For your sake , " turning to Charlotte , " I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for <UNK> estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh ' s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? " " A little . " " Oh ! 1861.1300646685768
It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ? 2258.7528043264138
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . 2139.498495182906
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world . 2209.0324980062533
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . " " Ah ! 1993.0252058266458
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . 1551.714668769729
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . 2646.698210185338
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> . 1647.8708494973641
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . " Mrs . 1488.6897043294357
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s . 2898.502109452876
Who should suffer but myself ? 4818.938892765249
Why must their marriage be private ? 1252.5342475092823
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 2010.9231569172437
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 2931.020434867482
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? " " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . 1985.687711766994
And for this we are to be thankful . 5679.74305478383
I wish you had been there . 3847.911140078521
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 841.2249967784873
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 1474.6477734228165
Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 944.7545623475379

Mary <UNK> for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . 1746.01466617038
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . 2228.2915752478298
On Mr . and Mrs . 931.3868704023217
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . 3162.5466616751073
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . 1849.076545713906
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Mr . Robinson . " " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? 1936.385597215924
You will be a very happy woman . " Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 2380.5244322843673
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . 1340.2815803844876
Elizabeth now began to <UNK> . 1289.6897924853288
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might <UNK> to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . 2691.1679184824156
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . " " Are you quite sure , Ma ' am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said Jane . " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . " " Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . " " Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . 1253.0042563128025
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 1624.0460391951538
Miss Bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs . 766.9075358942265
what could she mean by it ? 1815.0388525911562
Mr . Darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . 1283.9571684976372
Mary was obliged to <UNK> more with the world , but she could still <UNK> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <UNK> between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <UNK> to the change without much <UNK> . 1925.6883877269902
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . 2315.6133598035735
Other schemes too came into her head . 2073.949187753968
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . 974.171254345125
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . 1587.7779544424834
" I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . " " Who do you mean , my dear ? 1609.079729761121
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent . 2259.899493830469
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of <UNK> and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 2407.013671047773
He has more to give . 3350.1877345551316
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable . 2117.0544524785214
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . " Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . 1780.425495368671
Not a soul knew of it , but <UNK> . 4347.163334702387
I know no harm of her . " " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her <UNK> ' s death made her mistress of this fortune . " " No why should he ? 2864.2881263507165
how he must have felt it ! " " I never saw any one so shocked . 1365.6907951691076
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 3975.2935788086083
There could not <UNK> in the world two men , over whom Mr . Darcy could have such <UNK> influence . 1041.1051972879786
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been <UNK> , and it had actually been <UNK> that Colonel Forster was going to be married . 1910.7643559885735
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 1744.247981131857
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 3340.9203012865905
Are not you curious to hear how it was <UNK> ? " " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . " " La ! 1901.7889547661769
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 1250.8247618896546
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a <UNK> situation , and always spending more than they ought . 1810.0586503234981
It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . 1824.271406569571
Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ' s <UNK> enough to <UNK> him from its <UNK> , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never <UNK> without him . " " So much the better . 1346.6356428043964
I thought I should have died . 3101.4285068155596
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 1163.9814822419974
From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . 1370.8094324943286
His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 1926.9636046986352
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . 1236.022447626115
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . 2229.9841899844155
I have not been accustomed to such language as this . 5600.428075413256
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 1986.659271621206
Mr . Bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . 1770.2508102077168
Jane was distressed . 962.7716241527767
" Not at all . 7569.941675989626
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 1171.90668463649
" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech . 2946.509458217556
How is half such a sum to be repaid ? " Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . 1489.8944696030624
How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? " " That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . 2747.725473427213
But I am at his disposal . 6340.96852039441
Collins well . " " Yes , very well . 1011.942954217781
Darcy said nothing at all . 430.2807290680791
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . 2121.5393499254974
My aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . " " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . 1635.744056064195
She now lost every expectation of pleasure . 934.8833336229936
" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . 2204.48559175503
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 4274.5977053094275
<UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . " " We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . " " But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs . 1671.0902485572367
Lydia ' s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , <UNK> engaged with one of the <UNK> <UNK> in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little <UNK> , of his house and garden at Hunsford . 1530.0571511204428
Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . " " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . " " I believe , Ma ' am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . " " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . 1884.5686004449562
" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her . 2792.6867967553844
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . 788.9431533945435
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 715.2173098566193
Society has claims on us all ; and I <UNK> myself one of those who consider intervals of <UNK> and amusement as desirable for every body . " Elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak <UNK> to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from <UNK> a <UNK> either from the <UNK> , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by <UNK> to dance . 1617.4978557867678
She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . Mr . Darcy said very little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all . 1255.5293751335662
Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . " Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . 1221.3881119739792

Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . 3119.7050369556555
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . 1275.63865517032
" I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . 1890.6759999039737
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from <UNK> in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death <UNK> of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and <UNK> as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly <UNK> her father not to let her go . 1950.0955717585384
" I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel <UNK> ' s regiment went away . 1226.7349261458678
Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . " " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . " " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " I honour your circumspection . 2432.6579176238006
You will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . " He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit <UNK> long . 2462.943515647947
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily <UNK> seeing him , till after the departure of the former . 1857.1540480140864
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in <UNK> ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs . 2963.631676966485
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the <UNK> on guard , and dressing a <UNK> and <UNK> . 2650.9236756859127
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . 1619.3762198774232
But it is so strange ! " " Yes that is what makes it amusing . 3792.1227437417924
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . 2982.842113048532
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 2540.073327061207
<UNK> of business too ! 3504.878455599097
Their visits to Mrs . 1645.9000534063443
I am glad he is gone . 2450.4074757040794
But she is nothing to me now . 3896.884723561744
She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa . 1536.5999010720857
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word . 2089.8689587810204
Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> . 2098.5368770835403
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 2991.525736885659
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had <UNK> time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 1721.716862443561
Gardiner , though unknown . 671.46501501226
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . 873.6730126987555
She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . 936.3923562786657
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . 3168.5163798674207
They walked on , without knowing in what direction . 1679.782609346196
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . " Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . 1769.2712288752562
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 1198.3634340947197
" Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal <UNK> , you last night laid to my charge . 2076.1309619161193
Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . 1604.6163768748522
" Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy . 1760.7606531358279
It was very little less . 1507.61786773088
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . 3542.391815201243
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 1587.794188219567
I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " " And they must marry ! 2180.972054033469
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , <UNK> to invite him to sit by herself . 3148.3240685171377
He still loves me , and we are engaged . " Jane looked at her <UNK> . 2348.059376806644
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so <UNK> with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and <UNK> of her own family ! 2421.7037212046203
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare <UNK> to listen to . 2533.345501049833
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . " " That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever heard you utter . 2466.372238564238
" They have both , " said she , " been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . 2799.1977251569506
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . 1008.4497770146598
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 2133.1557377310423
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <UNK> <UNK> better than <UNK> ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 2006.2047204362614
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 1615.4055943720111
I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! 1533.2912108932107
<UNK> me in silence . 3717.73923307794
" Your affectionate friend , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " Oh ! 2845.889965399308
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . 3555.8677508955816
In this <UNK> state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 1876.7661545825597
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 3911.2375742593917
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . 1510.3879337756853
Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend . 1429.833424839925
My courage always <UNK> with every attempt to <UNK> me . " " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . " Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . 1784.5942852201954
<UNK> the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it cannot be long . " He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . 1661.0358963870306
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
" Good gracious ! " cried Mrs . 1093.694618889796
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 2053.9523601778556
Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . 1871.9702408356673
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 1233.9926749650363
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it . 1955.1420102645498
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general . 1394.7179947893287
Mr . Collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . 1350.2937600175367
How was that possible ? 3360.5234841218034
The evening passed quietly , <UNK> by any thing extraordinary . 1333.693531059453
how acutely did she now feel it . 3801.4063020741287
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . " CHAPTER IV . 1493.7344260115174
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . 2233.3196931041566
You refuse , then , to oblige me . 4575.398304780482
my sweetest Lizzy ! 1736.0581357820658
<UNK> Michael S . 5854.527928744069
Collins ' s <UNK> of meat were too large for her family . 2286.2368525025736
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 2725.831277769346
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 1343.0891955400332
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . 2499.2662527964467
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . 1414.9272657197314
" Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . 2064.0479071970753
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 1061.0881070239361
One must speak a little , you know . 546.181962556323
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were <UNK> of dejection . 1696.3709362412349
Thank Heaven ! 1925.479739131712
She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . 2277.1772387397914
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . 1337.2720415639742
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " " Are you , indeed ? 2406.029806014319
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . 1487.6340425632854
Her cousin <UNK> his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the <UNK> of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . " It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . 2030.7311064858325
Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a <UNK> air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . 1660.393954465482
So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 2787.36938507831
I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . 2324.506529093043
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . 1279.836438250574
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . 2252.849484227331
We were married , you know , at St . <UNK> ' s , because Wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish . 2979.534737793349
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . 1471.8609064441473
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! 2432.569073372159
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <UNK> him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 2617.744113197933
It was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch street by noon . 2525.0392307686393
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not <UNK> me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . 2163.067532648003
CHAPTER III . 1172.5131852383306
You never see a fault in any body . 1174.9096293254827
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction . 1214.7294790332821
But now it was all too natural . 4981.464736522665
" I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ' s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . 2389.946394953669
The hill , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . 3157.07360490644
And it was settled that we should all be there by <UNK> o ' clock . 5006.308166061158
Mr . Bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is <UNK> with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . " She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . 1907.3034372327327
Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane ' s ? 1348.6264250508993
Did he know of their intending to go off ? 2159.238908280941
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . 1987.0808786135426
After playing some <UNK> <UNK> , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to <UNK> such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " She smiled , but made no answer . 1252.475450542071
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 2308.3579950931903
What <UNK> money , what <UNK> , what carriages you will have ! 4754.398460498556
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . 1377.0634552158024
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the <UNK> that is laid on them , as nonsense ? 4182.731548386894
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . 2000.5355007073883
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . 2094.0683304629906
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> . 3726.002425729122
Her report was highly favourable . 1703.9503391042242
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s foot <UNK> , that she said , ' Mr . Collins , you must marry . 1128.3304712253519
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 1486.9036005152248
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 2087.717943036275
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> ! 3863.4268818953874
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . 2794.7271827682657

My poor father ! 964.066861945121
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 1064.286768443236
<UNK> those who are at all his <UNK> in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . 3630.55270711386
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 1943.8260978939486
But I must tell you how it went off . 1771.2718139449148
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its <UNK> , to think of any thing else . 1763.7431848817232
" Oh ! 1745.268895136781
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . " " Oh ! 2792.2614102376415
Perhaps he thought her too young . 1233.57491100401

She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 2267.2908160983707
On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . 1890.844613854839
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . 1324.0431072333752
Let me never see either one or the other again ! " Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no <UNK> , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re <UNK> the admiration of her former lover . 1374.097656083044
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 1050.6725073507232
Elizabeth took up some <UNK> , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . 1762.1714047415546
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . 2892.916676940586
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 2421.087211252964
I enquired after their brother , of course . 2328.4352762151575
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes <UNK> , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . 1956.262039044878
" How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! " cried Lydia . 3246.693760258659
That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <UNK> in town , as Mr . Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . 1645.4792992739492
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise . 1962.135180941127
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " " That you certainly shall . " " And I have another favour to ask . 1543.5344733164372
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an <UNK> man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a <UNK> , had nothing to say to her . 1635.529499206596
I was uncomfortable enough . 1912.3143343024933
" But so we all do . 7418.494454742295
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over <UNK> , as I always am . 3465.752639561571
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? 1849.4841120600788
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . " Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of <UNK> such reflections . 1519.172108676648
yes I understand you perfectly . " " I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . " " That is as it happens . 2431.3392241626552
<UNK> would like to go too of all things ! 1125.7969244791143
My dear Mr . Bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? 1395.5844146721627
Kitty and Lydia were far from <UNK> Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . 1602.385973146412
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . 2285.3927516334497
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so <UNK> ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and <UNK> , " Let me call your maid . 2448.5129584782057
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . 1370.03917922935
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . 741.9446726698126
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . 983.6238012862605
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . 2439.569378090618
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year . 1109.0247035832845
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is <UNK> the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken <UNK> , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . 2326.280692181573
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to <UNK> , and was but slightly affected by his <UNK> of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the <UNK> altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh . 1852.6825201863558
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? 3792.716891160206
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent <UNK> of <UNK> on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . 2478.1481818749894
There ' s for you ! 7481.225723701262
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she <UNK> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . 1729.8378847539805
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . 487.17965252693176
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . " " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth . 1353.2568367036288
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . " " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth <UNK> ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy ' s steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself . " " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a <UNK> . 1890.2168187426034
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . 2182.587032529023
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . 1108.2919339940058
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . 2352.6751385304597
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . 3140.0588998686526
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 1172.0145204885857
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . 1958.8630485769038
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to <UNK> people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? 2031.6028258647927
We must have Mrs . 743.9577724686409
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . 2085.6548103110235
They soon <UNK> the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . 1593.4851630320336
On both sides it was only assertion . 4955.033951806385
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . 993.0390600081456
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . 1919.3746798078641
I know not what to think . 1579.4442347509294
Oh , brother , how kind you are ! 1719.0320533367574
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . 1285.5604274893387
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . " This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . 1658.6761563804841
Their first subject was the <UNK> of the Rosings party . " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . 1443.7530421067281
Pray do not talk of that odious man . 1821.2281959466493
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 3418.8716309689285
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . " " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be <UNK> with . 2448.548864874295
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . 1858.404873669427
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . 2576.8236895364503
Hurst ' s gown " Here she was interrupted again . 3548.9785104610337
" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? 3551.757980031685
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . 862.7840924630126
And pray what sort of <UNK> do you make ? 2335.357513445577
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 3362.873639644789
At length the Parsonage was <UNK> . 3120.68870401408
An union of a different tendency , and <UNK> the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . 2828.0751241571893
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 3285.183098651545
If a woman <UNK> her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . 2468.8212279316094
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . 540.7352356076292
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have <UNK> domestic felicity in so <UNK> a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . 1675.1909283726218
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . 3248.808971800848
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> . 2805.6154868060835
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 2642.704366579845
What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . 1953.509725560095
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be <UNK> . 1697.0615567831203
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . 1751.7476478310746
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so . 1815.0153253267736
One seems so <UNK> without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth . 1500.1297785316372
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . 2456.7791053237934
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , <UNK> painful to me . 2917.869967931891
" She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . " Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . 2320.5669917408486
Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . 998.2797223009896
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? 2086.9199829968825
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . " " In what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought Elizabeth . 1967.7098850588409
This is my advice . 4295.391457898968
How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . 2305.0960456908547
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . 2275.8861722578345
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . " Elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! 2896.536855004806
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <UNK> your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter . 1902.5486642772332
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . The possibility of his having really endured such <UNK> , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained . 1488.8492357886344
But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . " " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " Yes . 2273.0996905431602
My sisters may write to me . 1107.0984623749493
" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . 2487.577694051381
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . 1088.0538555701048
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <UNK> with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 1602.6852877314957
Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Mr . Collins began . 808.9579248681647
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . 1302.595055121453
But that is one great difference between us . 1008.3517816566547

Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater <UNK> than first <UNK> often boast ; and so <UNK> did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were <UNK> to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 2190.7541642174438
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring . 1785.1574071887906
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short <UNK> . " " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . 2432.296123062712
In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <UNK> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 1456.5575754965446
" Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 1945.781578302164
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <UNK> from the marriage of her sisters . 2055.4762686747545
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 1575.2066773250126
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . 2674.7304920738065
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . 1612.8661571767595
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . 1175.148190494453
Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion . 2363.3408357982485
My father bears it better . 1290.5720040760727
Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . 2217.111461900572
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 1519.902705474522
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 1617.3248628952242
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs . 951.8314548241915
My father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . 1781.4739699424997
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . 1106.2242077422654
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 4111.46843673461
As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner ' s hope of Lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its <UNK> . 968.7303309356279
They will never be distressed for money . 1769.5390849847383
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . 1245.8223679185965
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 4917.239272480783
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 1958.86503460059
Caroline is incapable of wilfully <UNK> any one ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . " " That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine . 2296.3015300136653
" You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . " " I should be sorry indeed , if it were . 2957.5703605254976
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 2675.14002953429
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . " " My dear , you flatter me . 1732.1054928836709
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . 1246.6134404885395
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh ! 1206.1447612687252
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . 2677.649228534779
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? 1155.951848006587

When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . 1958.9232037128704
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole <UNK> of <UNK> , as was here collected in one individual . 1578.2243635606885
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . 4180.1457869198675
CHAPTER XIV . 1263.0515403986196
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an <UNK> on every subject . 1622.68057202473
Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in <UNK> , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and <UNK> a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire . 1874.7888114656032
The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 2399.9785184340076
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . 1534.8832443657636
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , c . 3382.7776468236284
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 2060.4716301927147
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 1437.5248721016374
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . 2492.815933760392
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself . 2591.653550197585
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . 1997.143529772189
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . 904.3136256564832
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . 2660.3216993483757
How well it <UNK> . 2647.8041588075293
By you , I was properly humbled . 4580.590579765938
Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . 2098.2236920259347
" This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! 2706.6221789005276
If I wished to think <UNK> of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however . " " If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . " " Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . " " This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . 3042.630728319041
<UNK> it be so ? " " Oh , lord ! 4248.434436829023
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . 1928.6181303990847
I speak <UNK> . 2703.2500015864393
" Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? 3213.3059162832346
<UNK> , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . 2734.220409410629
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 3590.5811053304606
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . 1543.9160950918763
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . 2357.937915516718
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . 1566.5943954522918
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
But so they always are . 3363.8906011007216
" How <UNK> have I acted ! " she cried . " I , who have <UNK> myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! 5009.09663283919
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 2220.646353139011
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . 2054.352115545405
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . 1069.3412391586735
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 1481.1582666743648
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half expectation which Mrs . 1487.7432488208628
He seldom appeared really animated . 1069.0026180964505
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . " " You observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . " " Certainly not . " " To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! 1567.1938133333863
Bennet . " My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received <UNK> at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right <UNK> Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose <UNK> and <UNK> has preferred me to the valuable <UNK> of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <UNK> myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those <UNK> and <UNK> which are <UNK> by the <UNK> of England . 2291.370713126224
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 1742.9179391687678
Its <UNK> depended on others . 2933.710866693417
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had <UNK> to his amusement . 2710.7752083336204
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 1946.1231194857473
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 2292.43868273233
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 2181.111219721541
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . " " Not as you represent it . 2227.759453457172
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last <UNK> , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were <UNK> answered . 2598.255786987922
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of <UNK> , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than <UNK> anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 1913.270426449963
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others . 2178.5968406903603
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . " Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . 1564.7828465747004
Are the <UNK> of Pemberley to be thus <UNK> ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . 2657.19854482019
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 2562.2018884018025
She is gone down to her uncle at <UNK> ; gone to stay . 2278.5668650843854
Elizabeth immediately <UNK> the livery , guessed what it meant , and <UNK> no small degree of surprise to her relations , by <UNK> them with the honour which she expected . 2226.9228387141566
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . 1170.9170276813402
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . 2899.0232098033857
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had <UNK> <UNK> only four months ago , would now have been <UNK> and gratefully received ! 1905.5787879632262
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head <UNK> acutely . 2519.5086872688066
" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . 875.2390117870807
My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them . 2359.2368376110894
What shall we do with him ? 3586.4994974305523
I could hardly keep my countenance . 667.1985425465695
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . 1732.2876099471048
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . " " Aye that is because you have the right disposition . 3079.870742740935
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . 3378.318830014844
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so <UNK> courted you . 2733.4023105949354
Lydia <UNK> as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very <UNK> solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips <UNK> of turning away <UNK> , and if he does , Colonel Forster will <UNK> him . 2765.3254111892234
One day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . 1539.1568974084119
She was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . 2052.4838995339096
A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it <UNK> from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . 2456.0988685832253
Let the other young ladies have time to <UNK> . " Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . <UNK> of the party were now applied to . 1695.944917983685
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 1413.0392676717347
" Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated . 3586.6697638169667
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 3098.637822609733
These are <UNK> , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . 2825.787861775826
" Of a fine , stout , <UNK> love it may . 2181.31069362468
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey . 2812.0939880220344
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <UNK> . 1468.248267053037
If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession . 1773.1067244106214
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . " Mrs . 1767.376169840585
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . 2521.631966074531
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took <UNK> in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 1585.8610854265896
Oh , Lizzy ! 788.4920135783765
" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But now we may be silent . " " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " Sometimes . 2341.2321899813464
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . 1605.6876593378252
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! <UNK> our surprise . 1835.634599662719
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 1875.1299933304185
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . 4179.935325694223
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . " " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . 1929.7816463471877
Long has promised to introduce him . " " I do not believe Mrs . 2084.07015821594
" They are going to be <UNK> near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! 2303.93171672098
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <UNK> , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room . 1236.0848303847574
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas . 992.2933117220658
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of <UNK> the mind of his wife . 1898.9199258448796
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . " " If I were as rich as Mr . Darcy , " cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , " I should not care how proud I was . 1746.0767604443347
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . 2231.163113973543
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party . 512.5913505180198
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , <UNK> from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and <UNK> by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 2285.147094589277
" Not yet , " replied Jane . 1208.2807352741004
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . 1222.1580553092053
Many small donations to , are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the <UNK> . 2245.1679625853985
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two <UNK> with Jane again , and the two <UNK> with Lizzy , and the <UNK> " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! 1953.3528083173123

They were within twenty <UNK> of each other , and so <UNK> was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . 3259.5408677288024
He knows where we live . 3044.871564038555
Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very <UNK> too for it is provoking me to <UNK> , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly . 2394.8346577233146
His surprise was great . 1364.5659172842827
Four nieces of Mrs . 1056.7230276990774
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at Longbourn . 1138.928415461088
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . 917.842873605269
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! 2007.7661130549934
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . 2227.6383704619025
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the <UNK> of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 1786.485163551764
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 1352.78015260216
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 1965.6580949105921
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so . 1767.6855172507617

" I cannot make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by <UNK> for being next in the entail ? We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " No , my dear ; I think not . 2145.7641298927283
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 798.7093396271213
He takes them now for people of fashion . " The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she <UNK> a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his <UNK> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . 2639.017254247457
You are lucky in having such a master . " " Yes , Sir , I know I am . 2766.3842833180224
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <UNK> <UNK> . 2342.342828438054
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 1439.6317542924442
is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must <UNK> us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . " Then shewing her purchases " <UNK> here , I have bought this bonnet . 3099.073404514871
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him . 1511.8681063203944
On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . 2201.515701459373
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? 3485.582072960258
" I hope , " added Mrs . 1142.0884353169058
Mr . Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . 853.9688686505631
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " " Ten thousand pounds ! 2472.062766650958
Her answer was warmly in his favour . 2241.990431209414
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . 1335.6917577901704
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . 2523.1297400782028
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . 1764.9990653146756
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 2404.0468378150345
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it . 2146.0831286201146
It was a large , well <UNK> room , handsomely fitted up . 2038.12943191556
I send no compliments to your mother . 1985.1004054680734
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first <UNK> his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . 1827.1117749792836
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 1753.3306581767458
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . 3199.984201067404
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were <UNK> to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . 2089.2008313241477
But at length , by Elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that <UNK> which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the <UNK> . 2478.192098326505
You are a gentleman ' s daughter . 2600.8850846101022
It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> . 3125.113912744114
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 2001.4350431116507
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 964.6046663487674
The time fixed for the beginning of their <UNK> tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . 2213.89152940069
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . " " <UNK> out , " said Mrs . 1814.807961334137
I can hardly write for laughing . 1778.2014519933664
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the <UNK> of his confidence in his friend . 2356.3659331742024
" It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . 2402.023174250281
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . " " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley . 1817.6520505641713
Make haste , and come down this moment . " Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . 1596.1451677956688
This is your <UNK> resolve ! 6229.490808370395
But in what <UNK> it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . 4158.690423856117
I shall like it of all things . 1450.1990266847529
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 1836.8569761442784
You know I have . 2531.704148342197
Heaven forbid ! 2154.0128923684188
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs . 1295.8997538141218
She will be down in a moment I dare say . " He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 2060.7561588050266
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 1675.976583316658
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 2101.8624205647707
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . 2936.7042787255928
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . " " Lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . " " I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a <UNK> of character . 2561.566085009861
<UNK> away the letter immediately and <UNK> a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . " " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . 2082.016077668514
When you told Mrs . 1004.1117280067841
Every thing being settled between them , Mr . Darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home . 1033.1824110029368
One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 1936.2040342976486
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley . 1290.1316888209785
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . 1314.3095708010956
" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . " " I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice . 2229.975204391775
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the coachman ' s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs . 1819.2681916578874
I know it to be impossible . " " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! 2263.825250294017
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . 1595.4267533601308
Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not <UNK> . 1639.5653926819807
Your mother <UNK> upon your accepting it . 1905.6705972303757
Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . 1444.765678349248
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 2249.163006950648
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 1634.908269082257
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat <UNK> attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must <UNK> every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <UNK> . 2125.185152405599
Miss Bennet had <UNK> ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . 1095.5901215934502
I never saw such a long <UNK> in my life . 1327.8740601041666
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 1400.2233646379573
She saw herself the object of attention , to <UNK> and to <UNK> of them at present unknown . 2618.837738775667
CHAPTER XVI . 1263.0515403986196
A fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . 1366.1346700357578
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . 2210.4758246408146
" What do you think ? 3066.142600945505
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 1538.9478132029303
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! 3952.117426731196
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 1924.9039659501614
so much the man of fashion ! 1177.57727045623
I must beg to return to the house . " And she rose as she spoke . 1848.264944821866
<UNK> spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother in law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . 2208.2357273638854
Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . 956.7527687650022
<UNK> <UNK> the face of Mrs . 2001.6771911825936
<UNK> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 2296.229364606678
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 2363.9439996263386
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 2192.3602332868168
The <UNK> <UNK> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have . 1896.397301710374
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . " Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . 918.2852499569649
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 1337.8028973799846
I will answer for it he never cared three <UNK> about her . 2156.994018137464
Why should they try to influence him ? 3813.455767999668
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs . 2247.8910524069474
The path just admitted three . 1964.518480302223
The adieu is <UNK> itself . 5937.852791907465
" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . 1438.1002018111094
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 2100.2296823226634
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth ! 2891.1598590231383
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . 1094.9053430313716
Bennet . 467.6253030517642
Nothing could be more delightful ! 1021.2953264173927
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " CHAPTER XVIII . 2963.286860929174
She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . 2071.7846892613225
She shared in their attendance on Mrs . 2322.8497443683414
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said . 2274.0889274404044
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with <UNK> all the <UNK> explanations . 2572.7769310444705
But I knew I should persuade you at last . 2241.2382583981407
It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 1305.137358261666
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs . 1312.9168250349921
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . 1734.1367843502578
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . 1044.1905111677063
However , if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg tm work in a format other than " Plain Vanilla ASCII " or other format used in the official <UNK> posted on the official Project Gutenberg tm web site www . gutenberg . org , you must , at no additional cost , fee or expense to the user , provide a copy , a means of <UNK> a copy , or a means of obtaining a copy upon request , of the work in its original " Plain Vanilla ASCII " or other form . 2191.571548888498
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . 1913.6676671388009
His <UNK> to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 2389.45951139577
His disposition must be dreadful . " " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . " Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from <UNK> , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! " " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; <UNK> of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same <UNK> care . 2179.3312815400864
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . 1813.6091130544423
I . 8417.255454931754
" E . 2751.0673281987315
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 2108.9220974016393
On Saturday he came again . 2178.982666854667
If his own vanity , however , did not <UNK> him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . 2537.7198814761095
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ? 1620.5048550819238
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of <UNK> whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to <UNK> , she began to regret that he came . 1597.2602485628054
He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these <UNK> had arisen his principal <UNK> . 3596.983974328309
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . 2459.9300909080257
" What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut . 2262.9582181239944
Do not let us quarrel about the past . 1742.2854184525625
When the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a <UNK> to her mother ' s <UNK> for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . 2493.0559558539867
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 1720.553834589859
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now . 2061.136968444637
I shall <UNK> it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . " And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh ! 2081.0119595886895
It adds even another motive . 894.2818216289647
F . 2041.484312852357
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ' s folly . " " Indeed you are mistaken . 2332.4217968853345
Well , well , I only hope it will last . 1361.6054485879622
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! 3352.428963354088
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . 2009.8413162698712
Bennet ' s <UNK> looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . 863.1224169598654
The Foundation is <UNK> to complying with the laws <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> donations in all states of the United States . 3411.5146907338894
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her <UNK> . 1328.7120799853542
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 1165.2888924731355
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will <UNK> you ; and so generous , that you will always <UNK> your income . " " I hope not so . 2809.8170375689215
here comes Hill . 2190.7828782231904
" I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . " " Not at all , " he replied ; " they were <UNK> by the exercise . " A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . 1903.7127655584266
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . 1668.8074097883468
Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 1493.6670712621774
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 1826.3465501965968
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . 2259.1052490291772
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr . Bennet , have you no more <UNK> <UNK> in which Lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " " I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs . 1265.9671175072851
" I cannot see why Mrs . 798.4001277908947
" You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried . 3023.468844785612
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> . 1461.7648530214688
You see how continually we are engaged there . 2262.2644263913817
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 1823.3337133729085
I am not qualified to form one . 2067.725941512612
CHAPTER XII . 1263.0515403986196
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of <UNK> , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . 1998.0217262176675
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs . 1471.1273421616522
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . 777.1973637079365
But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . 2399.4028583480617
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . 1589.5889672369462
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr . Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . 1253.7256474314502
dear me ! 1503.6007080050506
<UNK> check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and addresses . 2425.2089654827987
Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . 1380.7378724997338
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . 1796.9296837280956
<UNK> , selfish girl ! 2400.2783870540375
<UNK> may sometimes be purchased too dearly . 1727.643999845812
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . " " To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . " " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . " " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . 1722.4261189819836
I dearly love a laugh . " " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . 1964.4966139478577
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . " " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . 1799.4301838030426
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 1974.6240567269235
how I wanted you ! " " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . " " Certainly . 2287.0687931602138
But , Lizzy ! 2455.15696069115
that abominable Mr . Darcy ! My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to <UNK> it . 2231.5506416093276
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 2188.677388874749
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . 2201.963448047585
Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated . 1715.673944776825
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . 1983.8187996157296
There is one point , on which I want your advice . 1889.4129176837107
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . 948.8737110993586
. F . . <UNK> You agree to <UNK> and hold the Foundation , the trademark owner , any <UNK> or <UNK> of the Foundation , anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement , and any volunteers associated with the <UNK> , <UNK> and distribution of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works , <UNK> from all liability , costs and expenses , including legal fees , that arise directly or <UNK> from any of the following which you do or cause to occur a distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg tm work , <UNK> alteration , <UNK> , or additions or <UNK> to any Project Gutenberg tm work , and c any <UNK> you cause . 2248.0721551525526
Charles , when you <UNK> your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 1642.8001014541014
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . 2460.655851226045
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . 2183.700670779732
but from what the report of their engagement could <UNK> , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . 1385.6717459346378
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth . 1707.599388735454
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr . Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . 1903.517123811848
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . 1885.4453176989032
" Oh , Jane , take care . " " My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . " " I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . " They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs . 1567.7163171444224
It is useless to talk of it . " It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . 2669.262459786241
Mr . Darcy <UNK> you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . 2084.2663843027276
But you are always giving her the preference . " " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . " " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? 2199.857272837145
From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 1431.6605367067048
Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in <UNK> . 2305.403556242741
The next was in these words . 2482.1783076984993
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 724.6316292193981
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . 1361.6905485963332
" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1823.817931385295
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . 2785.0086392463845
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 1704.199422795514
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling . 1736.3934233387658
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . 1424.7501996960589
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth <UNK> out the coffee , in so close a <UNK> , that there was not a single <UNK> near her , which would admit of a chair . 2016.6448311354561
" And is this all ? " cried Elizabeth . 2438.2433778347836
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <UNK> infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . 1735.893899454363
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged . 1531.919373588927
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her <UNK> , by dwelling on them . 3800.041888482686
CHAPTER III . 1172.5131852383306
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia ' s marriage . 1829.9089217706173
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . 1398.8677231967333
Bennet was <UNK> in her acknowledgments . 2776.555187083084
" Yet why did he come ? " She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . 2656.611904605676
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . 3214.4496214222218
On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . 1579.3034915828046
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <UNK> circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her <UNK> and steady candour always <UNK> for <UNK> , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 1604.9907701311236
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! 1766.1325164121222
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . " She was then proceeding to all the particulars of <UNK> , muslin , and <UNK> , and would shortly have <UNK> some very <UNK> orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted . 2486.0203353717397
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and Mrs . 1553.17079109743
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . " Her father lifted up his eyes . 1445.7475416079085
What will become of me . 5096.89975239007
What did Colonel Forster say ? 871.3109011847488
' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! What , all five out at once ? 2747.6026470410393
" Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " From the former . 2348.399997532109
" Excuse my interference . It was kindly meant . " " <UNK> girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . 2415.076751901651
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn house . 1909.1455656000958
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two . 1629.9508619869675
CHAPTER XIX . 1263.0515403986196
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 1596.3024354851825
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . 803.3284233944044
Their powers of conversation were considerable . 2184.5539767508967
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 1941.0712334602672
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be <UNK> to her nieces . 1657.476068241572
Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . 1147.007231335779
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and <UNK> mercenary ; and the <UNK> of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to <UNK> at any thing . 2433.4193270994397
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 1115.6078132254595
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to <UNK> her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever <UNK> . 2315.763425381084
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence . 1744.6757891589982
Oh , Lord ! 1391.5224981447316
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 3036.9780267841925
Catherine , weak <UNK> , irritable , and completely under Lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self <UNK> and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . 1788.1234960869049
Jane looked a little <UNK> than usual , but more <UNK> than Elizabeth had expected . 1174.7099327900742
You must not suspect me . 2189.8106877984937
But if I go on , I shall <UNK> you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . 2223.041776069706
They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . 2936.7163517090353
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a <UNK> , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . " " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . 2177.3714357790373
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 1188.7481215476419
" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides <UNK> tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! " Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . 1468.5300922756724
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr . Darcy . " She then sought her eldest sister , who had <UNK> to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . 1734.0924070144995
How odious I should think them ! " " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " " I am afraid you do not like your pen . 2905.094401968789
how I laughed ! 4230.814893566033
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . 1687.6536362191143
Collins . 629.1352111673655
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 1845.1869361968631
<UNK> , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . 2030.490159219725
Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . 343.5206208456948
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 3063.025467432704
" Oh ! 1745.268895136781
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 1956.3420589908062
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were <UNK> the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . 2167.7359311903165
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most <UNK> character ! 1482.4587896894723
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . " " And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? " " The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . 2363.1474586928143
I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . " Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . 1751.5067443007993
With the <UNK> concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 2209.2737251517665
<UNK> it , Kitty ? " Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . 1843.5211174823291
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey . 1332.315150272837
" This will not do , " said Elizabeth . 2103.416766946973
It <UNK> because of the efforts of <UNK> of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life . 3263.4100298935655
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 1588.7597262126633
F . 2041.484312852357
Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . 1167.8500154567762
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . 855.5942586190725
She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband . 4418.390185712075
I dare say he often <UNK> worse things said than I am going to say . 833.3147179471938
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 1656.485064850841
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can ' t think . 1894.514781950681
Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . 506.33803290621245
But we must <UNK> the tide of malice , and <UNK> into the wounded <UNK> of each other , the <UNK> of sisterly consolation . " Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " <UNK> as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is <UNK> that one false step <UNK> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <UNK> than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 2364.7047855584515
I am so happy . 3135.6657542512507
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr . <UNK> . 1228.7463777804783
" Oh ! 1745.268895136781
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 3373.9060190634964
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 2452.7050020931415
They agree with me in <UNK> that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the <UNK> of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself <UNK> says , will connect themselves with such a family . 2731.8464089894887
Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . 1509.3728206469907
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 3387.5913185453005
We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . 1927.6819502032888
He danced only four dances ! 1787.4320812002961
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 1899.1061882747204
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Mr . Darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <UNK> throughout the whole . 1526.0778438724726
" I expected at least that the <UNK> were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! " " La ! 2179.169085909892
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an <UNK> with her brother for talking such nonsense . 1688.0912298961339
You refuse to <UNK> the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . 2668.5829521057653
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her . 2254.8892322483484
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . 1557.6112629534355
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . 1885.7988529494528
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus <UNK> my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to <UNK> your authority in my behalf . 2119.1552370809236
She was humbled , she was grieved ; she <UNK> , though she hardly knew of what . 2723.670110617482
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs . 733.9130169599105
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . 2069.940917773581
About the <UNK> , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . " Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings . 1891.5930112164704
His attachment to Rosings , certainly <UNK> . " Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 1973.256729169172
Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . 1673.6521001988087
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . 1493.7516937264597
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <UNK> <UNK> on the probability of each statement but with little success . 2200.158944381185
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . 1970.7817986610492
" Let us sit down . 1215.24462766381
Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him . 2735.07981918633
Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and <UNK> its extent . 3411.4869755919467
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . 2791.298841838716
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . 1679.8897700419113
Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . 807.4756962693344
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left <UNK> , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . 2157.3375924038482
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 1230.8188870257936
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 2371.3005445597805
" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? " said she . 1564.5050060193971
I will not tell you what it is . 4605.409493519568
I am quite well . 1062.751222838196
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an <UNK> of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . 1867.5860888117652
Could he , or the Lucases , have <UNK> on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the <UNK> more effectually to what they related ? 2072.6531093354033
He has heartily <UNK> me now . " Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . 2163.7779044992285
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 2374.3931777077332
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 1126.466047860843
She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . 1702.446841188613
CHAPTER XVIII . 1263.0515403986196
You alluded to something else . 1416.8469071320937
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! 2171.5003103223307
" I see what you are feeling , " replied Charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to marry you . 1323.7837937961485
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . 1520.5845763247173
Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in Mrs . 1552.4965446389006
His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . 1807.8890225812727
Elizabeth <UNK> the next morning to the same thoughts and <UNK> which had at length closed her eyes . 1665.6434505424543
By nature <UNK> , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James ' s had made him <UNK> . 3077.8966105056675
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . 1578.2112325582652
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . " " But not before they went to Brighton ? " " No , I believe not . " " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? 2294.4297929339723
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . " Hunsford , near <UNK> , Kent , th <UNK> . DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . " There , Mrs . 2477.0886899116445
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . 1631.1630234695876
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . 4057.917024477542
Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley ' s continued absence . 959.7185966223188
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being <UNK> dressed . 1778.550162201317
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . 1733.7728878974108
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard . 1633.594301469057
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners <UNK> respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 2052.191187659819
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 2225.5940930908955
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> . 1806.344773572092
But I have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous <UNK> , boy in the world . " Elizabeth almost stared at her . " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she . 2007.55980318801
I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister . 1891.1168242137742
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 2708.535133184861
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . But good lord ! 808.2881261422234
But , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 3101.042579521053
Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . " " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget . 2064.5180646855015
Mr . Darcy <UNK> it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . 2144.195515859075
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . " " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . 1811.8425615658373
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . 1774.5802016680625
We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . 1710.9991484158163
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 768.071946275653
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . 1130.2301784364602
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . 880.2182092874115
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . 628.880622709856
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My <UNK> were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte . 1543.9598335766755
Her ease and good spirits increased . 960.3298794907636
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <UNK> the excellent understanding , and <UNK> excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 2307.3576220726663
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 2507.835600532357
I think she will be pleased with the <UNK> . " Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs . 2227.491789159213
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . 2137.3809405164284
He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 1804.2265510190757
You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and <UNK> all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg tm works . 1977.074372653613
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances and to have Mr . Collins instead ! 1615.8692226920755
Mr . Darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . 979.2296681693775
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 1598.8321860083004
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one <UNK> idea of any thing . 1325.9327534318634
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the <UNK> , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 2380.7846121198795
It is too long ago . 1994.9832806118222
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design . 2039.495504463872
Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . 2123.397945848202
Her performance on the piano forte is <UNK> . " " It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . " " All young ladies accomplished ! 2724.3658960504727
Who are your uncles and <UNK> ? 6085.653289571703
Gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the <UNK> fashions . 2735.6481723568863
Of this she was perfectly <UNK> ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . 2535.734792006119
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 1793.2173170073577
He was on one side of her mother . 1448.9486487991492
" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face . 1289.2807024784042
Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and <UNK> passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . 1974.2702830688843
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . 1339.7833860360734
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <UNK> , readily obeyed . 1256.9531510654338
Come be quick , be quick ! 2731.836169032014
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 2069.723311678055
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not <UNK> their own , so much the better . 2857.2088711439987
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . 1439.3712866486392
They were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs . 2193.9545270294643

and to see dear Wickham too ! 837.7144975883924
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <UNK> satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 2446.5340803044983
But I have other <UNK> . 7481.225723701262
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 2056.9653877032174
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . 683.6772479705583
and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! 2240.546231205373
Adieu . 4859.704702742692
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . 896.3832746123003
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . 2341.6636297835453
There was also a <UNK> of one thousand pounds . 1467.1429501993707
<UNK> as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . 1704.5553416546124
" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . " He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very <UNK> thing , and called out to her , " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr . Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain . 1740.8163481179463
" I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . " " Perhaps I do . 1968.753999069529
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . 2068.0927221463703
YOU AGREE THAT YOU <UNK> NO <UNK> FOR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . F . . YOU AGREE THAT THE <UNK> , THE <UNK> <UNK> , AND ANY <UNK> <UNK> THIS <UNK> <UNK> NOT <UNK> <UNK> TO YOU FOR <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> DAMAGES <UNK> <UNK> YOU <UNK> <UNK> OF THE <UNK> OF <UNK> <UNK> . 6259.46568266708
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of <UNK> them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <UNK> , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the <UNK> kind . " She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <UNK> by any feeling of <UNK> . 3043.9115838571033
Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began . 1273.0148444235094
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of <UNK> to others . 1084.8739456905514
What could be more natural than his asking you again ? 2427.158565821426
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 2947.696718847142
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw . 1658.661370072652
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . " " <UNK> their income ! 2946.1402454297718
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . 1711.2094028797405
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . 495.19017755199076
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good <UNK> will <UNK> it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth <UNK> lest her mother should be exposing herself again . 1657.3690210094903
Good gracious ! 1546.8933660314794
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the <UNK> of the first . 1853.5337047806138
Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the <UNK> . 3277.0539617671975
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother ' s schemes . 1681.869259707889
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there . 2327.0884117210667
Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley . 1133.0038486301698
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . 1507.999773029049
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 1837.2322873369549
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ' s two sisters . 1156.9714198712993
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 1195.3067654188578
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . 1929.4582303889795

Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a <UNK> kind of a little <UNK> on one side of your lawn . 1421.1368418038596
You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in <UNK> those kind of schemes , and <UNK> a person of their <UNK> contempt . 2164.1325114881565
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! 2988.881700783969
They must all go to Brighton . 1060.650490989315
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . 1626.3385006227775
" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . " " You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . 1921.1948898460505
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . " From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . 1399.0870324919395
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw <UNK> in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . 1360.2462638031075
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . " " I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want . " " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " No , indeed . 2570.5675383777425
never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F . 1444.2222366190565
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . 1607.8286868755788
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . 1922.6665955526546
Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1486.874488206749
<UNK> Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . " " If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . " " She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . 2041.773013938298

Bennet was restored to her usual <UNK> serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the <UNK> office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton . 1703.2318187642843
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 596.8647004448823
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . 3002.234623185693
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 1777.6400148859714
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 1819.1469733315948
I wonder who first discovered the <UNK> of poetry in driving away love ! " " I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy . 1708.6941330590187
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears <UNK> the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the <UNK> . 1991.6282723694094
I believe I have now told you every thing . 1051.0277453019867
They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <UNK> <UNK> and head <UNK> there is not much the matter with me . 2475.7019416420817
yes ; there is nothing in that . 2696.95287991122
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 1196.0228829277357
CHAPTER XV . 1263.0515403986196
A lively imagination soon settled it all . 1337.6879493456872
It was then <UNK> in the following manner . 3055.990784633929
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
I do think Mrs . 807.5644980462239
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . 2350.751462294815
You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not . 1226.6090845927624
" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . 875.927690267122
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . " Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . 1822.5057474742218
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . 3497.023415394167
You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " " You mistake me , my dear . 3142.349513628641
Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the <UNK> of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . 2350.711655180483
I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 2388.0907073998087
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her <UNK> you . " Mrs . 2742.1861781122766
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . 2352.279979836262
" About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . " " Yes , " replied Wickham ; " his estate there is a noble one . 1771.8061776177442
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . 1594.002430900031
It cannot last long . 444.4045776918398
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <UNK> for Mr . Darcy ' s pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham . 1695.1754499136812
She <UNK> the days that must <UNK> before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . 1734.3634220155545
He is so excessively handsome ! 2696.57156961679
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him . 4156.316929048046
" And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! 2975.808925338327
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . 2051.6375893876725
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 2741.210346231061
From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . 1088.5163401371592
Bennet was most <UNK> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 1094.1302184202434
Their manners are not equal to his . " " Certainly not ; at first . 2946.5401766581963
How much you must have gone through ! " Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs . 1503.4325812412153
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as <UNK> , were in very good time . 2277.381221809906
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . 1508.221840118925
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 1872.4372798476504
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . 4243.097096564813
My watchfulness has been <UNK> ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I <UNK> in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance . 2453.179927414713
" <UNK> . 7935.451343962735
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the <UNK> , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <UNK> . 1586.922799580678
Let me mend it for you . 3586.4994974305523
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . 1409.8815364224101
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you . 1911.9201275030891
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . 1250.048760138404
But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came . 2614.9292398035886
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 1768.9718545770156
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <UNK> , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 1684.9339103764312
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? 3797.423651829598
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . 2039.685908091848
<UNK> was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth " My dearest Lizzy , " I <UNK> myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . 2296.0209996254903
CHAPTER II . 1172.5131852383306
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . 2498.2730348589735
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 2094.713373517436
They contained no actual <UNK> , nor was there any <UNK> of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 3525.4984932848733
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " This was invitation enough . 2609.8413722163677
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another . 1709.9640486418325
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . 1911.1685846813405
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 628.7584302949408
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason . 2890.635378788286
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . 2032.869954091365
There was another reason too for her opposition . 2597.189122682127
We dressed up <UNK> in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! 2286.1576640611916
Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side . 2157.574684366593
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . 2357.844296286014
you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 1943.389766153332
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . 2068.2636977707125
She has a very good notion of <UNK> , though her taste is not equal to Anne ' s . 2545.098238551563
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company . 1164.8098946258583
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " " You have . 2562.032222081957
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 1023.8438967680374
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week . 1323.108857854578
" Yes , Ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as <UNK> to the poor . " Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . 2982.28120003325
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 1606.0296787541772
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane " I hope and trust they will yet be happy . 1465.613728471859
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . 1261.7715025970133
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement . 2386.341904288451
Does your charge give you much trouble ? 948.2631777469613
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest <UNK> ; his <UNK> contracted , his air gloomy . 2418.119324622764
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . 1618.2679127704237
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . 2063.5127540781314
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and <UNK> <UNK> with great perseverance . 2826.8058106418193
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 1502.88878453637
<UNK> , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . 2251.606523427197
The visit was returned in due form . 1417.0082278779967
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . 1957.5078071875898
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " My eldest sister has been in town these three months . 1688.885599609922
who could have done less for her ? 1110.0265875620798
In Lydia ' s imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of <UNK> happiness . 1424.029300207574
<UNK> an only son , for many years an only child I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , my father particularly , all that was <UNK> and amiable , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and <UNK> , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . 1960.4689858771935
A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone . 1320.0753839870076
The dejection was almost universal . 2381.9220948433704
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? 954.339118298623
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <UNK> by the possessor , and often without any attention to the <UNK> of the performance . 1854.070575523627
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh . 1603.9701019813056
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s <UNK> . 2499.8443360036604
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 1212.8900137776477
Your idea of the ponies is delightful . 2614.0599354377323
" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your <UNK> appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . " " Oh ! 2618.3333008014956
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
Though Lydia ' s short letter to Mrs . 620.2241692675445
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in <UNK> , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . 1926.1443769929147
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . 1390.9672613005582
" Oh ! " said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . 1664.4757989960508
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . 818.5925162644397
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . 984.7128139505122
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . 2291.9385158843374
From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an <UNK> chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . 1815.5859014003886
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 1505.7293624790855
Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . 1636.9796568253153
Consider Mr . Collins ' s respectability , and Charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . 1431.5089048111192
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 1897.3709422650861
Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . 1389.0938224475265
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 1395.9770906271406
The old lady is Mrs . 892.9907969436997
Bennet ' s civilities . 1571.6850928108718
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 3361.8691767817804
Indeed he has no improper pride . 2391.9788545046063
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . 1962.9860445611905
She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . 1824.8699111594128
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . 1042.963800733618
Then pray speak aloud . 1175.2273503145877
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . " " Oh ! 1629.485434814267
During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <UNK> , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . 1966.824587380372
She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 1402.9718520215379
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 1232.0679260217876
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . " " <UNK> ! " cried Bingley . 1392.275455633466
Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! 2133.8615442963146
<UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . 2937.8536348195653
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 1544.3249975066688
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . 1680.4395798289668
Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their <UNK> in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . 2341.853656848123
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . 1396.0325471782066
In pompous <UNK> on his side , and civil <UNK> on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton . 1852.1434983555955
Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions , all of which are confirmed as <UNK> <UNK> in the U . S . unless a copyright notice is included . 2042.6755734795308
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 1833.5029740810062
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , soon collected them round the table . 2132.2413131894896
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . " " And I certainly never shall give it . 1180.2476770136946
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <UNK> of my son in law . 1711.8177230726367
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! 2611.8584903326346
He <UNK> how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an <UNK> manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there . 1529.604239488948
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . 2319.243840261421
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . 1042.4497644895025
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 533.3530468084758
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . 975.5540130177227

The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing . 2705.2501014549075
If he had been <UNK> before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity <UNK> could make him . 2184.0913948106977
" Where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door . 2192.2537626511544
" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . 2415.9995876817015
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the <UNK> girls in the country . 1587.5048325197383

She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . 1875.9800448536605
But are you pleased , Jane ? 1952.5905021898873
I am sure my sisters must all envy me . 1456.638225050884
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . 2102.316332302053
" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . 1204.8517712380155
Bennet was quite in the <UNK> . 1692.3293423532718
It was not all settled before Monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . 2471.733982557479
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 2613.1297299787766
" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself . 2272.2970896899546
A younger son , you know , must be <UNK> to self denial and dependence . " " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either . 1619.5050005384335
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . " Elizabeth could not <UNK> a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . 1930.1514375604881
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . 2002.9847586780645
It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . 2076.3209469751446

He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . 1394.502710466298
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . 3090.378827428864
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present <UNK> of good will are highly <UNK> , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . 2682.0390795723033
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <UNK> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 1758.2316003920666
There is nothing he would not do for her . " The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . 2325.0195477706566

His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . 1718.2672599746456
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 2071.1794704545773
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 2189.9298055258782
Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . 2196.496876214992
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 2327.3966628965136
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ' s <UNK> had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or <UNK> in him . 2272.678300371927
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 2962.556086154242
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . 2557.3206447742723
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . " <UNK> by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did . 2104.5893099834675
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . 2084.0131298429055
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " Elizabeth could not but look surprised . 1503.1396284819791
that he had <UNK> his <UNK> in the first dance ! " " Oh ! 3032.118107467925
Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual <UNK> ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the <UNK> of his thoughts . 2301.665203131283
I did not think Mrs . 1158.892972337509
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be <UNK> into it ? " " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to <UNK> with rather more <UNK> the degree of importance which is to <UNK> to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . 2275.346724481247
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 1933.981446563851

The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . 1543.3757859406214
These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 2742.4887367472575
But here , by carrying with me one <UNK> source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <UNK> . 2082.895980712658

Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . 1415.259389557868

But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and <UNK> forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . 1993.0528027398975
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 1622.7676596232532
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a <UNK> space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . 1556.946698893687
They followed her into the dining parlour . 2505.501415484288

We had better not mention it . 2377.1262947712794
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . 1909.0728683789516
It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . 1310.6356909542246
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr .

He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . 1779.7273478317943
How are you all ? " " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 2053.956751218876

Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 1963.1304020569883
Have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs . 2027.321556326586

He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it . 2027.077211647681
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing .

As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the <UNK> of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . 1621.8598687025706
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips . 1865.118610255632
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 1565.3574059344344

After <UNK> their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ? 3028.7481403711276
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . 801.2640952789121
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the <UNK> curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two <UNK> of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . The envelope itself was likewise full . <UNK> her way along the lane , she then began it . 1790.871549342993

When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 1554.4575048059978

The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 1571.7249641777075

They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . 1746.6493682555222
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <UNK> , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the <UNK> way for happiness . 1362.6251657332357
Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . 1006.1996884690012
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! 2864.1177208343556
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 2223.51867574373
Mr . Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . 1766.9290858619663

" You may well warn me against such an evil . 1883.3573208099403
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 1168.5680600425544
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . 2713.5722420126735
Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 2301.519145889923
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder . 1493.6001607806293
She will be taken good care of . 1590.657167961817
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . 1651.8175283122482
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . " It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . 1742.4629693004963
Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . 1750.5562776353675
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 2812.903868305533
He had to be sure done much . 1136.9878352672977
" And that , " said Mrs . 1678.7968438004357
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 2133.7512368289654
" Good Heaven ! 2201.655583739558
" I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr . Darcy ! " " It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . " " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . " " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . " " <UNK> ! 2027.9530542486452
CHAPTER VIII . 1263.0515403986196
In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 1241.746942382898
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <UNK> at the <UNK> of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time <UNK> her natural degree of sense , since the <UNK> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be <UNK> , was likely to be <UNK> in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a <UNK> place and a camp . 1813.1261708269906
Are the others coming out ? " " I do not know . 2546.9941478784344

It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions . 2139.3237186601846
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? " " Nearly three weeks . " " And you saw him frequently ? " " Yes , almost every day . " " His manners are very different from his cousin ' s . " " Yes , very different . 1825.3486911089344
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold enough to say before how much I like him . 1623.4664693096165
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " " Oh ! 1273.074662842723
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him . 1419.7111128857332
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . 2116.8053302579715
dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . 2087.3632524524196
Your sweetness and <UNK> are really <UNK> ; I do not know what to say to you . 2824.51389307545
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <UNK> ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . 2047.8903247159983
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . 2265.428195223048
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 2068.549110840206
Gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . 2384.197162548775
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 1235.0339975387708
" Then , who taught you ? 5419.951719574305

Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her <UNK> and <UNK> , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with Miss Bennet . 2061.8632598855575
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . 1711.222556174213
But I suppose you had no opportunity . 2950.3824639865275
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall <UNK> a list , according to his information . 2546.894252485828
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr . Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and <UNK> the prospects of Mr . Wickham . <UNK> and <UNK> to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a <UNK> , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the <UNK> of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the <UNK> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd . I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ' s accidental information , that Bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . 2047.7144715935772
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private <UNK> in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of <UNK> with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . 1843.802816462805
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 1730.8233146819036
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <UNK> . 1171.3791356734273
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him . 2707.9005894033194
Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 1697.9257389252666
Mr . Collins ! " " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . 1189.5859423730603
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach . 1177.1812567009606
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . 2062.9536416992637
what hours of <UNK> we shall spend ! 1850.2180124296096
Not that I care about it , though . 2723.7537388606206
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the <UNK> . 1947.3000174749209
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , <UNK> had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 1644.77746543168
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . 1407.755352946495
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . " Miss Bennet eagerly <UNK> all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . 1560.1131288625286
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much <UNK> ; but when Mrs . 1857.0960300449144
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be <UNK> from it . 2494.378138316089
At length Darcy spoke , and in a <UNK> manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . " " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with <UNK> , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . " Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . 1438.7148438188442
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . 3263.4140179801734
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . 1318.2835405650017
" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently . 2011.7629365364958

Her <UNK> wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . 1975.94265183875
By tea time however the <UNK> had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . 1511.9801740091436
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . 1042.149012413332

She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his <UNK> powers had gained him in the <UNK> . 1843.83047979124
" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt . 1500.6820571377598
A little time therefore . I shall certainly try to get the better . " With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . " " My dear Jane ! " exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good . 1764.171208999503
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . " " And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the <UNK> of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! 1913.4961560839101
Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very <UNK> said , " What is the matter mamma ? 1735.9010716606394
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? 1573.9614173673422
He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , <UNK> friend . 1613.563243898129
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . " " Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . 2666.6827593744633
The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . 1086.4694245756016
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 1772.8660248250399
But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . 1556.6447858053125
Oh , Lydia ! " " I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 1557.8273174381993
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . 1665.602989489645
Lord bless me ! 3063.777327388004
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . " Mr . Bingley followed his advice . 1815.0786334410775
<UNK> had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and <UNK> her disgust of Mr . Collins . 1662.480011311868
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs . 1347.1569973908279
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 2205.9126233868287
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . 1421.6412323628379
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 1432.3096966481444
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a <UNK> , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! 1258.3093615649675
<UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> . 1130.9259787020499
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . 2089.0165993204077
Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described . 2038.148442257075
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <UNK> and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " Wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of accents , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right . 1827.839240619116
The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion . 1484.9056982668485

You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . 1324.623805786662
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . 2240.848324717031
Bennet , who assured him with some <UNK> that they were very well able to keep a good <UNK> , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <UNK> . 2315.3100434046987
The letter was to this effect " MY DEAR <UNK> , " I wish you joy . 2657.606414444116
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . 1288.5016874516875
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . " " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . " " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " I am not . " Lady Catherine seemed pleased . 2011.3878993182007
You must contrive to send somebody . 1239.7217613195012
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . 2077.7408350861615
What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a <UNK> of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . " " Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . " " And what arts did he use to separate them ? " " He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling . 2354.9219951649666
A few weeks , he believed . 2897.032181719583
The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood . 2223.399961651903
Well , how pleased I am ! 2624.170293409079
She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 2001.5069399350218
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . 2801.58242562194
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 1988.1369004592052
His letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in <UNK> business , he was quick in its execution . 1949.7309959478798
shocking ! " cried Miss Bingley . 580.3704576954876
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . 2477.68839502476
" And this is always the way with him , " she added . " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . 1808.1426993157809
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? 2720.9652632228435
It cannot be concealed from any one . 1542.9924783072017
She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . 2191.631697729415
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , <UNK> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . 2263.552402655295
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 1310.8645211369349
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the <UNK> , but of that I <UNK> . 2135.349697152209
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " Well , Jane , who is it from ? 1991.8766255419466
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . 1468.629312238068
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? 1827.7895417076095
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 2105.7731942457667
She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . 3146.739027912307
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> . 2035.9123932758425
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 1231.4725122900923
The express was sent off directly . 1901.646010552188
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 1419.5904850255904

Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general <UNK> to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . 2182.2680951821835

Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . 933.093440514413
Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . 1478.5659857837002
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 1445.0448525683123
She directly replied , " You need not be frightened . 2212.7569359211398
Bennet and Mrs . 421.99996334657413
" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s <UNK> in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . 1811.6476956293116
Lakes , mountains , and <UNK> , shall not be <UNK> together in our <UNK> ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . 2860.1640915462453
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the <UNK> . " This was not very consoling to Mrs . 2266.0105237597822
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . 2080.998099231612
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 1703.9303225357637
She <UNK> from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . 1794.4145949077877
I will leave him to himself . " In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . 1781.4339647923632
It was in the <UNK> and the <UNK> , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . 3363.930840483836
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . 1358.77424340989
She had been <UNK> pleased to approve of both the <UNK> , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . 3999.2265466606973
But that is nothing to us . 1794.1410268068257
" Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 2113.08529299447
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . 2651.1362525503077
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . 1358.8282782519339
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 2641.072240662528
" Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . " " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . " " Oh ! 1616.0722243930861
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . 2215.0552157385578
The day of his and Lydia ' s departure soon came , and Mrs . 1132.2168322954199
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ' s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . 1303.1266999860088
" You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice . 1505.5078037739688
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 1275.6155122249597
I am sure you will be very comfortable there . 3556.764829516485
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 2966.9448512833696
His words seemed to <UNK> it . 2502.825812359896
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham . 819.0857951391749
To Mr . and Mrs . 931.3868704023217
To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough . 656.8441680413089
Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 2516.5216561467796
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . 1494.9888836643954
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . 2110.536621506994
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? 2318.4689950561296
To Mrs . 1133.6359062803915
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 1215.8944533250842
But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . 1463.3119801886808
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . 1708.8231496850044
" And pray may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a <UNK> tone , " Is it in address that he improves ? 3053.3703188082177
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <UNK> . 2698.7797371119777
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . 2115.7453309029524
I have not that pain . 4244.102682012228
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . 1937.2194174496058
Every <UNK> <UNK> in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther <UNK> of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago <UNK> his <UNK> in the affair ; that proud and <UNK> as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had <UNK> brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be <UNK> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <UNK> or <UNK> habits . 1893.1822193156481
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does . 999.8659577357575
Gardiner . 863.5921880730651
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so <UNK> to you . 3068.5277886081585
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . 1742.5447369221786
Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night <UNK> and <UNK> gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty <UNK> away . " " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " " You go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds ! 1880.2249335498507
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . " " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . " " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . 2104.148590103023
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have <UNK> either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . 1191.4891407735176
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . 1533.190935549387
I have not been in the habit of <UNK> disappointment . " " That will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . " " I will not be interrupted . 3702.5087599273033
As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . 1419.197478380312
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . 1845.3605901862109
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 3158.410105139753
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . " " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! 2359.221668050837
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . 1894.27069000931
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . " " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? " " Indeed I had . 3548.059062654622
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 1884.4720714038065
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most <UNK> in inviting Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 1518.0639933569703
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . 613.5176084722742
When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . 984.5524098246083
Miss Darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . 1179.0196049465735
Bennet thus began the <UNK> conversation . " Oh ! 816.7174380352103
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . 1153.302066665318
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . 2094.1611354001834
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her <UNK> , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . " " She had better have <UNK> at home , " cried Elizabeth ; " perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours . 1682.1914865050348
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <UNK> manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . 1870.347281487445
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish . 1656.9011412729894
My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his <UNK> in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . 1580.6146072473566
" How strange this is ! 5016.575016549804
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . 3445.283290288353
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . org Section . 4890.223696077817
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained . 2152.8277330920732
I am the happiest creature in the world . 2607.086825849872
Mr . Darcy replied with great <UNK> , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley . 348.8510517582598
I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . 1660.4688752008747
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long . 1219.5166455659692
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them . 1804.3802592656614
I hope he will overlook it . 3063.7674781096703
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . " " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal <UNK> of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first <UNK> for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . 2310.522134702707
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . 1676.818846712337
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . 2752.0193989836644
The <UNK> was <UNK> to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so <UNK> a <UNK> . 2418.2952879621644
Bennet one communication would , therefore , do for all . 797.712576802005
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook , complying with the rules is very easy . 3478.394126427496
They were ignorant , idle , and vain . 3044.654465454477
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . 1722.977671423483
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <UNK> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 1629.6300845357441
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 2012.3566551214433
If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 1921.85313883679
Bennet could hardly contain herself . 368.0080544781928
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 2141.6360419557795
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her . 1392.734292708707
how shall I bear so much happiness ! " She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty . 1612.9204381007044
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . 1187.1137688797621
Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . " In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . 1106.262576763858
But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . 925.219720805453
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . 3387.3832410115106
You must not disappoint your father . " " My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . " " Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . " " Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . 2262.537055206405
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . " " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? " " Dearest Jane ! 1969.292196082016
Shall you like to have such a brother ? " " Very , very much . 2618.4824695150833
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! 1939.5791498239446
Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 1509.0056952028908
. 10045.397617124398
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . " " Oh ! " said Lydia <UNK> , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , I ' <UNK> the <UNK> . " The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . 1560.6647300012544
" He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . 975.2479807689842
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself . 2493.645508873479
She could think only of her letter . 953.9785209300527
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . 2816.6771458345556
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 1326.6021029569013
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <UNK> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <UNK> , and paid off every <UNK> of civility to Elizabeth . 1605.136441885822
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal . " " True . 2833.269616179517
She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <UNK> him with fears and regrets in <UNK> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 2678.728485538878
In the former were many good <UNK> ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some <UNK> of Miss Darcy ' s , in <UNK> , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . 1918.4609354107747
I have not the smallest hope . 2618.759540904248
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . " " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . " Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . 2433.266327788243
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . 1240.838707237135
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so <UNK> that I cannot answer for being <UNK> . 1763.4550835742723
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 2175.6809533771457
Ten thousand a year ! 1427.061452860335
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever . 1401.5206800898425
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 2300.489896179763
In ran Mrs . 925.585743874518
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . 1625.3494696001255
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 1154.7195101596565
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . " And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr . Collins thus addressed her , " When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from <UNK> you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . " " <UNK> , Mr . Collins , " cried Elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly . 1620.2098044131985
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it . 2186.7673288004507
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . 991.5602132293865
But though every thing seemed <UNK> and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <UNK> ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . 1809.290423015429
Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs . 2077.128502689561
Who could about such a <UNK> little <UNK> thing ? " Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <UNK> and fancied liberal ! 2032.858072253059
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . " " I would wish not to be hasty in <UNK> any one ; but I always speak what I think . " " I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder . 1919.8818174120916
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 4917.239272480783
" He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . 1305.5528974506383
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 2102.5873800068007
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . 1180.5615954901634
Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach . 2719.9745325113654
But you have chosen your fault well . I really cannot laugh at it . 1702.9392336773665
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to <UNK> as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was . 2017.685500142351
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . 1939.3272723956136
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy ! 1167.4076419916664
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 1833.5089817622652
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . " CHAPTER VI . 2752.0303076438577
Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the <UNK> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . 1915.0812061535523
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . 2186.9390520219586
He was the <UNK> , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . 1319.5965328380826
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . Oh ! 1579.0409544089325
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 1790.6572822425755
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . 1532.2694409207015
Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . 1630.5893262701816
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . 1501.7619071005447
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . 1757.0630864009806
" I am all astonishment . 4244.102682012228
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . 693.5741342883196
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . 1079.851003533788
There was no want of discourse . 3199.850623068821
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . 2826.7197505162667
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . 1455.9077222712178
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
" But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing . 3542.500749429059
" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . 2414.3610104148443
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . 1705.9157321561886
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 1894.1150625164028
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should <UNK> an occasion of <UNK> his respect towards any body connected with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared . Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . 1407.8766814568694
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . 2884.3252052722637
Bennet and the children . 1241.6204637048365
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ' s character . " Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " <UNK> there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 1437.1278775341527
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
have you heard from my uncle ? " " Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . " " Well , and what news does it bring ? 2721.6226406951846
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . 2473.060709426908
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . 1984.8554852969794
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . 1150.1532966346258
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 2892.807382939553
In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . 2871.6270549516553
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . 2526.155978091993
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe . 1250.0181390371881
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply <UNK> on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . 3340.0906983924833
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . 1447.9939295739869
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . 1849.5326755086694
I never saw such <UNK> , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " Mrs . 2268.0725848631714
" Oh ! 1745.268895136781
Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to <UNK> it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . 1870.558103734553
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome . 1080.4385734754142
But on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . 2393.95067994564
" John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? " " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 1866.1584589706413
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . 1160.4455917503733
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . " " To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 1781.9499009137264
I will speak to her about it myself directly . 3483.251350837325
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time . 1661.1124705228754
With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . 2122.529448370711
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . 1715.2747109278407
When they were all in the drawing room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . 1461.5189151266907
Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . 1006.149639757184
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 1590.3926822196884
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 1601.6195727451293
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <UNK> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 1960.6023331455458
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I cannot blame myself for having done thus much . 1590.6279540185542
I thank you for explaining it so fully . 3843.5756744135233
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . " " Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> . 2025.1294363606205
Georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . 2181.050399483419
Had Elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . 1654.4396650266876
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
Elizabeth silently attended her . 828.9680423886722
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . 959.5201877901073
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 3146.990931732682
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . 2088.571338893753
Annesley is with her . 5736.943002907482
She saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . 2411.8005332753914
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . 1999.4285829558519
But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . " " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . " Elizabeth made no answer . 1796.8877682535851
Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 1997.1669746781947
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 2344.122377205698
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling . " " Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose . 2313.4629822076336
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <UNK> , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . 1778.3844387342106
He heard her with astonishment . 2016.1956524245861
Those who do not complain are never pitied . " Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or <UNK> her would only increase the irritation . 2266.1293649257277
Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! 1723.333020299768
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . 3344.1321505866945
She practises very constantly . " " So much the better . 2499.0014317221858
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . " " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . 1811.6197282761937
I am perfectly satisfied . 1714.0783798235884
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and <UNK> study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . " And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his <UNK> she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . 1821.3714639512007
You know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . 1761.9425775728437
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 1884.0119177598215
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 1220.5771699879328
Your <UNK> are by no means unlike . 3606.0816830435306
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified . 1629.4507544869075
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . 1703.3845321647052
Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately . 838.6888773399677
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! 1376.7498064185113
He begged pardon for having displeased her . 3293.4833417157624
" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr . Darcy ? " " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . " " I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . 1502.3265137031963
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . 1757.9097317092064
<UNK> , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . " " And do you <UNK> it to either of those ? " " Yes ; to the last . 2736.7230115698
" Well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " What say you to the day ? 1907.3783810782788
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . 1509.0932734865194
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <UNK> as these , what would have been her sensations ? 3129.0967462204285
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 1357.2958867115685
CHAPTER XII . 1263.0515403986196
" Yours , c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . 1627.7563226118164
I knew you would be wishing me joy . " " Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . 1924.5019790031174
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 2671.847231969566
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected . 577.8163496430203
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . 1763.331997013006
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 996.7160525352328
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my <UNK> on your privilege of universal good will . 3599.2437011361485
mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to day ? 1679.650151218812
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 2809.550779874261
" Did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ? 1791.3177924640647
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? 2410.0984732330476
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . 2662.0652815007907
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . 1478.8359264180049
U . S . laws alone <UNK> our small <UNK> . 2853.5737673298595
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 1480.2991406090928
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 1525.354156859318
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 1811.1101908667702
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I <UNK> believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . 1692.897486966912
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . 1462.8975893214379
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 1422.7078335980043
Bennet , alarmed . 1048.516612874921
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 1554.8829591854044
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention . 767.7168877154581
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! 2382.8641557260453
I did not expect such a compliment . " " Did not you ? 4425.273294893446
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . 1396.9648369101963
Allowing for the common <UNK> of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy . 1362.627328213553
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as <UNK> of derivative works , <UNK> , <UNK> and research . 2690.2335473217618
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been <UNK> by long expectations . 1331.9097716102044
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months . 2120.5076741682997
" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . 1571.6519800431863
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . 1828.031533861017
She is unfortunately of a sickly <UNK> , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who <UNK> her education , and who still <UNK> with them . 2919.0469323772204
She will follow wherever Lydia leads . 1503.6963376011536
He bore it however with admirable calmness . 2070.7161781398836
His belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 2250.0988109205887
I guessed as much . " And though he exclaimed at the <UNK> , she found that it had been pretty much the case . 2030.5366938711854
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " cried Elizabeth . 1106.3479278963773
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give <UNK> confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr . Darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr . Darcy in a most infamous manner . 1668.0191711355826
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <UNK> silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <UNK> between them again . 1288.638238294302
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . 889.6286831058214
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! 2441.906465016189
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 2114.678833195092
There can be no occasion for your going so soon . 2212.980582288835
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . 1739.0451630452162
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our <UNK> ! 2447.752524576841
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> . 1896.4941826032236
in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 1694.563280447101
" But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not <UNK> his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . 2695.563009528361
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " Ah ! 1220.772466792125
It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . " " Oh ! 2158.48238172104
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not <UNK> a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . 2911.0206411388654
Mr . Collins made his declaration in form . 681.0010342925609
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 2014.5246667114561
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 1867.8029316130257
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest <UNK> , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any <UNK> display of regard , or any <UNK> of manner , where their two <UNK> only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 2142.911288669845
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 2427.9580151432237
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . 1554.1759312156223
He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable house . 1664.558365448823
Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <UNK> at whist , enumerating all the <UNK> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he <UNK> his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . 2286.914726132922
To know that her daughter would be married was enough . 759.9904841971688
Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . 3373.1111142677987
She longed to see Mrs . 836.679947355129
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged . 2295.537604986757
GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . 1267.5046682757186
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . 2789.98948557026
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman <UNK> the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . 1506.2341928213348
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 1638.9577637820594
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . <UNK> immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . " " What is his name ? " " Bingley . " " Is he married or single ? " " Oh ! 2070.8909078988363
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 1825.0175232105341
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 1802.006820461088
Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed . 2203.011285014944
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 1590.3584248943846
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to <UNK> his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be <UNK> <UNK> . 2592.102289971562
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected . 1661.0571156537274
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . 1163.2459931848643
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , <UNK> , manner of talking to her brother . 1377.120738951864
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . 2601.0512208276805
How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! 3312.7058490763343
I have no such <UNK> to resent . 6028.396226004949
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 1884.186839567203
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " Oh ! 1319.6654777352082
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . 1362.3903054462376
Bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at <UNK> , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to <UNK> you when your father is dead . I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . 2175.0290692190238
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater <UNK> concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being <UNK> by <UNK> , <UNK> inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . 2773.911061966576
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 1509.705346935565
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 1744.1583291808743
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? " " Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . 3138.140718871367
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . 1799.9313517967423
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 2926.648794674302
But we are all liable to error . 5038.434626530337
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . 2395.765719501038
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . 1835.2000190676704
At five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . 1334.979783586438
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 4903.360595495045
Elizabeth felt Jane ' s pleasure . 353.74603484528717
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . 1682.765350151067
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . 3515.4618460066195
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 1409.9057371971596
Is not general incivility the very <UNK> of love ? " " Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . 2170.7323895666527
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals . 1133.7085538008814
Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . " After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! 1923.6682974252788
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 1558.2163958501035
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though <UNK> with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 1771.8495641053569
Every thing , however , went on <UNK> , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ' s first sketch . 1294.0851060832101
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . 2544.679837823151
" <UNK> in other words , you are determined to have him . 4263.392064978209
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different <UNK> ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . 2188.9904890645735
Elizabeth hoped she had <UNK> him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 957.2277307230727
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . 965.3763116004376
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self importance and humility . 2354.8884924680906

The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 1093.6976646580324
Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ? 2061.7398454753015
You see on what a footing we are . 3723.5842665500913
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 2640.1979952949973
<UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her . 1677.2211211653487
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . 899.6510923934583
I do not deserve it . 5096.89975239007
I am not equal to it . 4542.177543863468
And , besides , no <UNK> of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then supposing them to be in London . 3492.3470210083365
Philips were now <UNK> of the most interesting intelligence . 2903.174840009485
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 1456.8335633952481
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and <UNK> every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the <UNK> of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 1551.0908002706558
<UNK> since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 3046.549787222518
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 1858.1483464908054
CHAPTER X . 1263.0515403986196
" DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations . 2498.242581452631
The supposition did not pain her . 3626.148591345121
But really , Ma ' am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . 1739.1140193584706
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . 1815.8760749477667
GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 1612.4963784327097
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . 1347.7584108436808
The discussion of Mr . Collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . 1898.1694138041396
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . 1303.0874874928743
It was at Sir William Lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . 1879.6546365735082
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr . Wickham . 1049.7243754535996
Gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , <UNK> of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 1677.3632189095204
Nor was Darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 2076.3577954221782
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . 1896.9971274485122
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 2336.787166731443
my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . " " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . 1830.517423785365
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . 1480.5913034986793
yes . 1931.0508373691578
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his <UNK> when he speaks . 3423.3074069957997
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s <UNK> . 1221.7733947595616
Lydia laughed , and said , " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . 1991.391983803021
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry <UNK> , a very mean art . " " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is <UNK> in all the arts which ladies sometimes <UNK> to employ for <UNK> . 3216.735755524872
They must have seen them together for ever . " " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . 1413.265988570925
The <UNK> letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 2101.0326954758207
You are safe from me . " " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . " " And your defect is a <UNK> to hate every body . " " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . " " Do let us have a little music , " cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . " Louisa , you will not mind my <UNK> Mr . Hurst . " Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . 2243.9724485442835
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her <UNK> intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . 1573.7576197669387
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . 2135.8525314734757
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 1405.1497527658084
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . 929.8636608444847
Mr . Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . 1297.9380965992655
Bennet ' s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . 1119.110577611487
and so did Mrs . 2355.2320870139665
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 1145.42838756229
<UNK> wore a happier aspect . 3574.8641624005927
CHAPTER X . 1263.0515403986196
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 1013.3093492698551
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . 2605.5092957620727
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . 2827.7354740327573
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 1570.9328104809283
It <UNK> me . 7704.992065124647
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . 1482.7139615014698
How could I be so silly as to wish it ! 2153.3767400142297
" While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr . Bingley . " " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife . 1416.0589032384087
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 2641.757147297976
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . 2271.666222905678
Lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . 1766.2700155309317
But papa is so disagreeable . " " A little <UNK> bathing would set me up for ever . " " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty . 1414.9025772988903
Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a <UNK> over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was <UNK> Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <UNK> . 1971.8157937503122
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 1561.5487210271576
When I last saw her , she was not very promising . 2898.8593121673175
I will put on my things in a moment . 2393.0744309992024
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 1877.842149192042
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she <UNK> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . " Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . Wickham ' s attentions . 1604.3289561794866
Hill and the two <UNK> . 2301.7268876871594
" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 2372.823117466915
Is not it so , Mrs . 3222.039810346609
Every body declared that he was the <UNK> young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always <UNK> the appearance of his goodness . 1455.3245400875464
" Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair . 1903.6039888285732
Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . 2034.5617352746997
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . 1983.359313593139
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 1964.960049413917
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . " " You are over <UNK> surely . 2778.797213655031
Their fortune on both sides is splendid . 3038.6129477512627
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild <UNK> of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . 1877.9466717716646
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? " " One of them does . " " Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . 2557.8338332165845
You must therefore allow me to follow the <UNK> of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . 2281.535705189555
Well ! 1383.7882726812752
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley . 1435.3641001358994
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 726.3538825743691
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . 3120.7734992014857
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> . 1694.3338608514462
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had . 2338.9656963774
Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon <UNK> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 954.1841240283071
Bennet . 467.6253030517642
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 2132.5357046380755
" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance . 2067.9033096802086
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 2316.69632689863
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . 1173.7329842747506
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 1342.8779309574693
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . 2520.6174012656743
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her . 1674.7623165117786
" My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . " They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . " " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence . " " You cannot be too much on your guard . 1851.8682924177792
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . 2518.205509914934
She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . 1097.0412759689489
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <UNK> , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 1992.8024110861948
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and <UNK> heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 1900.2491765509892
Could there be finer symptoms ? 3098.8119835227026
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <UNK> . 1514.6584006955216
what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . 2414.424741463314
But , alas ! 5854.527928744069
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 1964.682261044566
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . 1469.6121505024055
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 2806.087496457518
Bennet very dull for several days . 976.7400308106976
Every kind of pride must <UNK> from the connection . 1010.3668482497632
Miss Lucas is married and settled . 573.3809680982523
He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 1384.7242699607448
Heaven and <UNK> ! of what are you thinking ? 4241.899989562481
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back . 738.7449034091455
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . 2071.225175872417
Mr . Bennet protested against any description of finery . 1229.8641898888836
But I confess they would have no charms for me . 2780.901221431228
They <UNK> as expeditiously as possible ; and <UNK> one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day . 1204.0694647574642
Two <UNK> , however , were plainly <UNK> from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been <UNK> used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 2608.418996241935
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . 962.6342826210088
" I found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr . Darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . " She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . 2052.5638912214736
What is your own opinion ? " " That it ought not to be attempted . 3893.1495379395196
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 976.9881929663524
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . 1352.9727816887748
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that . 2977.4349201976434
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 1784.863783776805
If the <UNK> of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . 2365.145063302057
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough . 1152.4265632253355
She had even learnt to <UNK> , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a <UNK> to disgust and weary . 3299.145589812548
We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 1382.700412942962
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
What am I to do ? " " Nothing child , nothing . 3227.594959698103
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she . 2130.5250402782412
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 2797.592646610554
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . " Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . 1280.1202245979912
What is to become of us ! 2675.504578585526
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . 1375.717471995642
Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . 1527.3525008268716
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 2045.170124000779
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose <UNK> of <UNK> support . 1943.406374583266
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 448.4387812476668
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more . 2316.8337812918253
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane . 1669.9350406772323
His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . 3075.8553800369737
CHAPTER VI . 1263.0515403986196
Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . 1479.6953222133218
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 2265.698952570365
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . 1287.7927024386163
For , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken <UNK> , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the <UNK> reproof . 2402.95182233154
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 1100.106136223378
They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . 1803.6786424594281
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before . 1967.7984543025207
The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs . 1529.1339753375983
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . " Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right . 2193.6708302744296
They had long wished to see him . 1384.8857351293736
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the <UNK> of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . 1855.309379835866
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . 781.6328070388188
How much sooner one <UNK> of any thing than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . " No one made any reply . 1911.8606207044606
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse . 2715.7139980719166
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . 1427.6046139863454
Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant <UNK> to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " I do not know . I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult . 2314.227847099493
I hope we may often meet again . " Elizabeth smiled . 733.286742053893
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 1985.7410034697514
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 2136.713511252678
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . 1944.7769137394118
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 1342.4554550025641
There was no help for it however . 2495.1563356385286
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy . 1748.7760067237523
<UNK> donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any <UNK> concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States . 1584.8221659729213
Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and <UNK> her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family . 1501.0252320562383
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 1394.7453016682439
Annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs . 1629.4970853107104
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 1391.1181776461788
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . 1690.220662536192
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . 1423.2246689792091
The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of <UNK> , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her <UNK> <UNK> . 2472.262234847195
The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in <UNK> and <UNK> , and the evening at one of the <UNK> . 1956.2635924126164
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 2199.6006144105245
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or <UNK> reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . 1944.8001196340563
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . 619.1394281653894
" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . 1017.0967907173371
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . " To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . 1422.2193567945935
Let us hope for better things . 372.81864525826666
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . 2024.4691294945455
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . 1691.6312553288694
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . 2242.439191258541
They entered it in one of its <UNK> points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , <UNK> over a wide extent . 2524.2241039528435
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 2377.6743297619378
I am most seriously displeased . " Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . 1543.0837040153967
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . 1334.9798276816498
Lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 1323.193087846693
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her <UNK> spirits , and of teaching her that her present <UNK> are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 2522.115783403954
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on . 3357.928043402715
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <UNK> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . 1737.483162641922
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . 2929.269525980974
I told Mrs . 616.7853910295055
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . 2036.3989996330288
" <UNK> <UNK> . " CHAPTER XIII . 3700.5525832037897
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 1474.865901993952
Not all that Mrs . 2355.2320870139665
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 1761.1806407198671
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united <UNK> . 1416.8171153633903
Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her . 959.8129464681476
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " <UNK> so I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . 1717.1158824036856

With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 1942.3156343161713
CHAPTER <UNK> . 2004.9693439188225
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 1241.8318128895635

It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 1436.935693486127
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . " " Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . 2065.1190855875843

Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs . 1519.6691917525711
Make haste , make haste . 1229.7158344248185
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! 2326.6239796774203
The others have been gone on to <UNK> , these three weeks . " She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . 1667.7276800242557
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been <UNK> , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . 1897.758562317836
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . 1541.220546232088
Elizabeth merely <UNK> to him , without saying a word . 930.8170406467655
<UNK> is impossible ; <UNK> , <UNK> . 4606.695248580975
so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to every body . That is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . " " Did Charlotte dine with you ? " " No , she would go home . 1607.063934456004
" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister . 2741.8896864702056
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 1824.2042053385105
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . 2134.466446864237
But , really , I know not what to say . 1856.8406312269706
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
" What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? 2646.8468224902767
It <UNK> me , I confess ; for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . 3626.947078661827
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <UNK> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <UNK> . 2793.647916383691
She performed her part indeed without much <UNK> , but Mrs . 740.5186684949547
Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt . 934.1162010563788
Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley . 971.1024006595935
But he is an ugly fellow ! 4563.504197079164
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 1350.7739245270245
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and <UNK> the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 1994.8898164660775
Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a <UNK> chaise . " " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . 2293.9346642424794
Does he know his real character ? " " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . 1618.5275536592346
" I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . 2511.1919419055175
CHAPTER XI . 1263.0515403986196
But his pride , his abominable pride , his <UNK> avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in <UNK> , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . 1959.015700419843
I am sure I <UNK> ' <UNK> get a wink of sleep all night . 2700.5745497308626
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . 2555.108531682608
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . " " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . 2275.842618783328
Her ladyship was highly incensed . 2005.207255701332
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . 1993.717773003282
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking . 1242.6519612396687
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . 2843.494381694547
I am ashamed of you ! 4665.4972551255405
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were <UNK> in her favour . 2739.671249070836
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . 2906.413781430804
I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 1927.4063313609863
If she does not object to it , why should we ? " " Her not objecting , does not justify him . 5231.727926740146
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . 1037.304749348972
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 2635.595119012149
I only hope they may have half my good luck . 1057.0415874059938
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? 3455.781072013739
" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . 1535.0788007933168
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and <UNK> in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . 1905.422719414936
This match , to which you have the presumption to <UNK> , can never take place . 2397.9578665713407
Such was Miss Lucas ' s scheme ; and <UNK> were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . 1687.640747422062
From that moment I observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 1551.35516945641
" Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say . 2400.60936071665
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . 2100.693278424539
The extravagance and general <UNK> which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 2314.5341468573347
" I did not know that you intended to walk , " said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . 1793.512408054553
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was <UNK> for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . 1760.4074597754422
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent . 2286.3396670584507
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . 884.3658622162264
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . 711.3860554087074
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 2460.3429369403507
She is not such a simpleton . 5894.7164405333
And it is the more to be <UNK> , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte <UNK> me , that this <UNK> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs . 2726.2105816568087
<UNK> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all . 2238.670990451316

Has it not been <UNK> <UNK> by yourselves ? 7335.670239776667
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 1784.1269455219349
it is of no consequence . 4177.217625728401
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 1980.106636596788
I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . 3600.148020384507
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the <UNK> kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . 1479.0523056655027
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . 1503.733503271702
" You are <UNK> , Lizzy . 3859.146299687186
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . " It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . 1516.44893447559
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . 1188.3067290970566
He had never had the slightest suspicion . 2374.1536494668676
" My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . " But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . 1698.5204734206472
Only look at her . 3384.1914819636645
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . 1448.267291798559
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . 1667.3555361617991
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man . 2176.9327593906933
Oh , no . " " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . " " No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . " " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . " She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . 2401.7815727741618

In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . 1954.2423043347915
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . 1646.0377901935
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth ! 2693.662203822224
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 1387.5192371732355
" His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . 922.5598916548562
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s . 2512.1696198743384
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of <UNK> for them . 2276.9685477593016
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so <UNK> ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . 1486.987153355528
You deserve no such attention . 2522.829726826083
no . " " I can much more easily believe Mr . Bingley ' s being imposed on , than that Mr . Wickham should <UNK> such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , <UNK> , every thing mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr . Darcy contradict it . 1508.4477161606455
Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits <UNK> high . 2003.0214078936851
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 2666.0013604247215
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern . 1394.8102411575662
Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently . 604.8142843941762
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy . 1176.9258223243608
So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 2796.5479423893416
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . 1426.1745246370772
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 2291.3419218753606
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 2190.3682377134105
Bennet , was not so well pleased with it . 1680.6176111023224
The <UNK> <UNK> of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in <UNK> with her opinion of each . 2904.905946291378
Is this to be endured ! 5721.076536095295
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . 1944.2851964240972
Bennet give up the point . 672.9177739708235
Very well . 1377.930069055746
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . 1003.5316695369888
CHAPTER XVII . 1263.0515403986196
She does not yet leave her dressing room . 1295.2890198315336
" Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . 1743.506905789807
The first part of Mrs . 615.2385104144016
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 2363.1801604871725
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 1939.863827853624
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . 1245.5834187622638
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 1478.8676903484509
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago . 1434.1423384709033
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 2903.3710322105203
You <UNK> me for coming ? " " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you . 2128.661271675837
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 2508.7847025905658
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 3438.8224571214414
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " <UNK> you ! 4067.2691932745292
She blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who <UNK> their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . 2560.744312471177
But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . " " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother . 1671.780527413347
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of Darcy ' s . " " Oh ! 1115.868746639208
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 2540.4058058203427
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! 2023.2786030794916
" He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 1932.4453181918095
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of <UNK> in that way . 2641.6789552599753
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . 2492.4637986457683
What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! 2367.0386068065636
The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . 2173.7923529289446
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 1511.2858852149845
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . 957.6679029689101
I know we dine with four and twenty families . " Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could <UNK> Bingley to keep his countenance . 971.1166018311546
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . 3340.70819112641
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " Darcy mentioned his letter . 1916.134509614801
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . " " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 2276.6304413942653
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature . 2294.2332212815286
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 2920.493348180094
You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her <UNK> , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . 2792.0993978933825
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 2268.484298622138
They will ruin your happiness . 2720.980737723362
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 1902.56760622766
The garden <UNK> to the road , the house standing in it , the <UNK> pales and the <UNK> <UNK> , every thing declared they were <UNK> . 2716.194282326692
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to <UNK> the engagements that had been made for him . 2487.3126670601687
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . " She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . " Again his astonishment was <UNK> ; and he looked at her with an expression of <UNK> incredulity and mortification . 1903.9802624798372
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long <UNK> . " Mrs . 1902.9175618129732
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . 2011.100735251832
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr . Darcy , she moved again towards the gate . 1512.2947288612668
He was <UNK> his memory with <UNK> and noble names . 3987.0630801885777
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , <UNK> my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " " It is well . 2853.940104907159
But my dear Lydia , I don ' t at all like your going such a way off . 2101.7739698335827
" Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . 2051.200220004562
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger <UNK> than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance <UNK> and <UNK> . 1907.0954257026656
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some <UNK> , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings . 2971.5744248848605
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and <UNK> way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to morrow evening . 2099.770447286315
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <UNK> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . 1275.812989331035
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . " " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were <UNK> and insolent . 2234.332829023432
She had very little notice from any but him . 3148.2260200783594
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 1539.9842590704134
He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father ' s intentions . 2142.675048352039
" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . 1915.431654442357
" He only told me , what I have now told you . " Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart <UNK> with indignation . 2219.510502832966
Collins , you must send a servant with them . 1325.283250689296
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed . 3257.600639516851
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . 1688.0777355104274
" So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find . 1232.0365891632177
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . " " In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . 2824.9966515806505

Not these two or three years perhaps . " " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can . 2291.073042520998
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 2952.837809827161
" My aunt , " she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor street . " She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley . 1719.156800378576
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage . 1796.101515337459
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . 2048.007596891792
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s <UNK> her coming so far alone . 2269.6377405331677
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . 1154.4868976411879
In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . 1823.9837464450022
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 816.8470175280346
Wickham ! 602.7721829866183
Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . " " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . 1631.2049817794584
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! 2288.818290517796
To Caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit . 1660.7868574308645
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing room . 1225.4649852639604
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . 1610.751929520095
Elizabeth was delighted . 693.4672473607434
As for your Elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what <UNK> could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye <UNK> , so remarkably fine , might be copied . " At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . 1985.6481329910619
But she is perfectly amiable , and often <UNK> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . " " Has she been presented ? 2771.806852123592
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 2089.9343325252426
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . " Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative . 1752.9333897840559
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the <UNK> , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening . 1484.2724631267633
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . 1089.7939225974496
" What will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are ! 4106.1579109074
" How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet ! 1431.3519117769017
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 2797.9579264021795
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . 1496.178205796355
Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs . 697.6249434492194
CHAPTER VIII . 1263.0515403986196
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . 1944.8165308571085
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 1877.2559827613866
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . " " I should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother . 1864.0060146330156
Let me hear from you very soon . 1462.8096241075946
good or bad ? " " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . 1688.0577269651533
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she <UNK> in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . 1893.0558296478719
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <UNK> by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . 1699.9435863401627
I always had a value for him . 3035.4624758948794
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . 1175.6070803457658
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . 1410.2658758366385
Her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . 1470.25307413473
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at <UNK> ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . 1984.3327987336918
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . 2842.650567160133
Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . 1736.766891150649
<UNK> , of course . If you mention my name at the <UNK> , you will be attended to . " Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . 2432.3086593714424
She was ashamed to think how much . 1285.5217167716826
" Lizzy , you must not do so . 2326.161843212207
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 1321.7002513037328
See paragraph . E below . 2459.528701247797
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane . 1541.0967059549605
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . 788.5474108235045
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . 1256.4515993909758
On the following Monday , Mrs . 1448.0822211223738
I dare say the <UNK> upon Mrs . 709.124389715901
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . " The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . 2362.4238608200635
Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the <UNK> and smiles of the whole party . 1464.9945711323985
He has children of his own , and may have more . 3557.5110799551103
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair . 1267.7659189567046
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . 1346.8711059739076
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . 2417.8363953508374
I wonder what he can be doing there . " " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth . 1588.4814594538177
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . 2448.2537899118374
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . 2202.6397816824197
Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . 1986.7246985410338
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 1906.4250025574374
They would doubtless be <UNK> with the generality of female minds . 2638.5474873079984
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . 1719.4093573739465
Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 919.8848871827577
It was a rational scheme to be sure ! 2421.0133707035498
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . 895.2615210305823
See paragraph . C below . 3478.298846350525
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . 1700.4601827525287
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 2113.7191390484654
Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 1354.2592686215448
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its <UNK> . 2241.6250433197783
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! 1173.6189956678281
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . 4765.100202703785
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 3959.8164859094686
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . 2122.641741005041
Oh , sister ! 643.2491243672944
" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . 2151.79632766823
Though our kind uncle has done something towards <UNK> him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . 1074.3741279947967
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 1948.8698360606923
Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party . 1923.2267269409267
At night she opened her heart to Jane . 1220.9167651911646
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . 3961.080495546541
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the <UNK> , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 2625.381980434971
They are all for what they can get . 4719.0392824973205
It will pass away soon enough . " " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty . 1594.0121383647859
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 1253.6151319647386
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ? 4608.399227550437
And what sort of young lady is she ? 1803.954555715297
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 1867.7066643898038
Mr . Collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . 1068.081430720182
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 2054.378128064082
But don ' t imagine it was from any silly cause . 3445.0524479820065
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . 2152.422091010317
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 1393.201140428371
Bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . 1256.7269945786593
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 1536.4955693195004
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . 761.5237671429763
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 1262.0631688528003
Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . 1599.0372246395063
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy ' s meditated elopement . 1389.6147525448441
His apparent partiality had <UNK> , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . 2888.204383228426
It was only said , ' <UNK> , George Wickham , <UNK> . 2571.70346530876
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . 2226.3472038070927
If the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the <UNK> . 1867.634958735586
The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . 1259.7897153479455
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <UNK> , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 2384.1446289481437
Bennet by admiring Mrs . 594.9773820439874
They <UNK> their wretchedness , however , by <UNK> after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . 1318.0304924902657
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his <UNK> to myself . 3901.235740840988
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . 2010.5597921366063
" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam . 2078.1545256767217
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <UNK> them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 1423.2995962406123
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . 2085.9015447055444
Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . 1290.9215176546004
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . 979.7056275382876
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 2437.1786703862776
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 2037.658012719902
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 1264.9020905897783
Bennet could hardly comprehend it . 322.15094502115176
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " I never heard that it was . " " And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . 3208.3222528571596
Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him . 1698.757985766727
Do not distress me by the idea . 3172.456487207036
I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . " " You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr . Darcy . " " No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ' s connections . 1133.4034755971213
He cannot know what Mr . Darcy is . " " <UNK> not ; but Mr . Darcy can please where he chuses . 1324.7096296985062
" What could he mean ? 1447.5645300479416
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some <UNK> , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . " When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister . 1492.5579609925278
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation . 1579.9975751832455
" Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . 1557.7728147822897
She could not <UNK> him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . 1898.8448100905546
Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces . 1671.223288645328
CHAPTER X . 1263.0515403986196
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . 2279.572310424791
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 1384.113647396404
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which were scattered over the <UNK> lawn . 2974.4854241262005
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 1291.3587341681623
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 2209.1403351386566
Younge was of course removed from her charge . 2124.3025087930455
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to <UNK> ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . 2028.64694049028
On this subject , what can you have to say ? 3061.187723768137
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . " He is now gone into the army , " she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . " Mrs . 2534.4805218311667
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 1554.8213979129273
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs . 1178.9537158491787
" I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could . 1129.5756123152464
Gardiner , rendered <UNK> by Elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . 2121.2933925208267
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . 1611.2800699516552
This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . 1880.5196159152104
" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire . 2319.405352101886
I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the <UNK> . 2161.924321757876
" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not <UNK> declare that Caroline neither <UNK> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <UNK> the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly ! to put me on my guard ? 2709.825827792446
Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " Lord , how tired I am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn . 1916.2500041881328
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her . 1779.1596208095266
Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . 1976.6459366092802
But will they make you happy ? " " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " <UNK> at all . 2835.472521502555
CHAPTER I . 2004.9693439188225
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <UNK> family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . 1919.343518594317
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 2361.088552173038
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 1209.3489931216986
But slyness seems the fashion . 2612.05857799476
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 1938.5494744160662
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . 2125.2458213821287
They were to be off as soon as possible . 2842.787753616746
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 1472.5544859995912
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! 1455.6282619510005
" <UNK> resentment is a shade in a character . 3229.9998114644573
The business was therefore soon settled . 613.0846644826536
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional <UNK> in praise of his own humble abode , and the <UNK> it was receiving , he was happily employed <UNK> the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . 2652.8480664363065
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 1777.4654901366766
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . 2419.814408129959
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , <UNK> love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means <UNK> , though it could not be exactly defined . 2061.3836854294264
These were the contents " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . 2331.5814287439093
The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 1456.0209736958693
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and <UNK> of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their <UNK> . 2333.6934166444394
At length the chaise arrived , the <UNK> were <UNK> on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . 3059.315969888705
<UNK> contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation ' s web site and official page at www . gutenberg . org contact For additional contact information Dr . <UNK> B . 2451.5299973916535
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and <UNK> pass away . 1603.0250893789314
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us . 1909.8280392506867
My temper I dare not vouch for . It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world . 1802.3473598181981
A clear ten thousand per annum . 1336.0194379020058
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention . 2024.723968478216
Poor Charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . 2233.5919860466856
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . 1577.8035630616462
There can be no love in all this . 4433.221927375983
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . " " Indeed ! " " Yes the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> . 2408.5499331776164
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . 933.8926718581098
By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <UNK> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 1366.8972544825656
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? 1346.1280243921792
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . 1626.1801822249968
Till this moment , I never knew myself . " From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . 1645.064358507564
I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too . 1752.4009159882705
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 3005.2906137394802
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . 1590.2785905821904
It was over at last however . 1871.9586524066012
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . 1252.118853688961
A great deal more passed at the other table . 1438.9252328366574
She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent . 1300.5735758179985
oh ! 4859.704702742692
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . 883.1334557014975
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . 2295.3023434246975
Long and the Gouldings soon . 1600.8694981134674
it is just as he <UNK> . 7418.494454742295
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . 1611.5684353474035
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell . 1819.5300183961383
It would be dreadful ! 1346.5023434292916
" <UNK> Oh ! 2474.515807056702
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the <UNK> of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . 1381.4856023285593
To the civil enquiries which then <UNK> in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer . 1656.3770031784777
Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , <UNK> exclaimed , " Good Lord ! 1446.4769919117737
Gardiner . 863.5921880730651
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . 1080.4829939006431
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> . 1484.8326770075719
" While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . 2536.238332290168
He had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . 1769.0662062237493
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <UNK> <UNK> her there . 1860.9018762755509
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 2971.201289759186
" She is my youngest girl but one . 1924.7674242164776
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ? 2040.490908550835
He cannot afford it . 1926.803221083086
" <UNK> it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . " " Gracechurch street , Monday , <UNK> . 2606.3568478135344
" How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . You think it a faithful <UNK> undoubtedly . " " I must not decide on my own performance . " He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . 2049.7651173800964
Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . 1292.5033780863837
Kitty , run down and order the carriage . 1803.895232277057
At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . " With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 2011.6501261818514
They must be a great loss to your family . " In Darcy ' s presence she dared not mention Wickham ' s name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <UNK> in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , <UNK> herself <UNK> to <UNK> the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . 1927.3540723155559
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 3358.109856932752
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . 1650.214123596007
Why any fear of detection ? 3667.8987809917226
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . 1727.200780913808
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 1635.5436222318237
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged . 1287.2759410848926
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . 3032.1062372583056
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . 1014.230300953538
but there were two or three much <UNK> in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to <UNK> it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . 2763.9468819681274
Teaze him laugh at him . <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . " " But upon my honour I do not . 2925.6044025699107
There was also a postscript to this effect . 3035.3996256520013
What do I not owe you ! 5743.16524327372
Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody ' s reserve , can be answerable for the event . 2454.718087253489
or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " " My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . 1517.156480852333
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . " " I see no occasion for that . 1724.6934308445746
Lady Catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . 1803.9166122014485
What do you keep winking at me for ? 4483.642640011725
He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia . 929.9728238972345
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly <UNK> at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 1017.5307223441234
My fingers wait your orders . " " Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . " " Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1789.22548678869
Believe her to be deceived by all means . 2947.7962188587235
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . 1988.2889502549967
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house . 1050.2219983132857
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . 1060.8749320621416
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 1801.6133411133328
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . 3531.869606303885
He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . 2173.388101671679
Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . 1731.3539990712404
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 936.7767016086232
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will <UNK> excite . 2006.919792198739
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 2131.199871504218
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character . 1373.847293815965
I do not wish to avoid the walk . 2046.2174538947388
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . " " What should not you mind ? " " I should not mind any thing at all . " " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . " " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail . 2767.0619221434895
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being <UNK> by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . 1342.299177149333
I think I have heard you say that you know them . " " I know them a little . 1517.5070742267228
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it . 972.7852836236895
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . 3541.589962626187
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . 1679.2441554903805
Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . 1709.1463501219685
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr . Darcy ' s steward . 1552.8809645226204
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her <UNK> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . 2128.008633916878
Lady Catherine was <UNK> proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her . 1153.1492627906755
Mr . Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . 1583.3163263435295
" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . " " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . " Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . 1767.363885912352
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . 1661.7578483306295
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . 1250.922600402233
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 1866.8139934819048
" Oh ! 1745.268895136781
Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . 1312.8043423571448
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . " Kitty , who took all these <UNK> in a serious light , began to <UNK> . 1908.3638985420878
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 1893.3585705759929
She certainly did not hate him . 2978.9318646423935
I speak nothing but the truth . 1222.4688535124335
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . 2723.605745488239
She went on . 2683.150094436358
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else ! 1732.9483321737005
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
A house in town ! 1297.2189912732629
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . 4610.400634896203
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . 1940.3499743207349
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 2404.7483514269047
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . 2849.3969641419035
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 1804.0833501644577
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . 1516.6045488418322
Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it . 1348.8967065155614
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten . 1331.3004666022428
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . 2093.3217575597487
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! 1500.3273475900642
The Miss <UNK> all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . Do you draw ? " " No , not at all . " " What , none of you ? " " Not one . " " That is very strange . 3679.483453100193
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character . 2414.012746742242
The children have been wanting me this half hour . 1939.5214167081756
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . " " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . 2067.9617477388465
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 1028.5893064567315
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . 1797.9552223455955
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? 1772.5669503280953
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . 1800.6419859267558
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . 1877.7315246269893
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . 2515.029674257735
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 577.2700524664664
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! 2442.4364324673525
" Good gracious ! 2260.4179828053875
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . 2445.7204450865097
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? 1076.6635298215342
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were <UNK> your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month . " " You have only proved by this , " cried Elizabeth , " that Mr . Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . 1584.830310651288
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . 904.2104700838463
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr . Bingley ? " " When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . 2218.2605107365384
He has not an ill natured look . 1898.1937541163404
How I long to see her ! 1872.02834493228
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . 2455.7768756211353
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 1388.9416520374734
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . " " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 2734.5676832693944
Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . 1947.7650133634857
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to <UNK> her confidence in it . 1287.7991924401422
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . 1082.6027248018368
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object . 1068.326943129859
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . " She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . 2175.1901233162275
Most earnestly did she <UNK> to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . 2367.69165146392
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . 1644.017056684012
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1077.4348686915664
It was first broken by Mrs . 1225.1791017276144
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . " While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much <UNK> to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s . 1835.9102364872372
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 1529.2376169716842
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself . 767.8935619323366
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that <UNK> is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . 2037.1261313292514
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . 2190.06520975336
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 1432.8502232505068
The <UNK> of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . 1185.4943348046313
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . 1570.991580532969
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . " CHAPTER VII . 2142.803234189888
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . 1292.6297511816213

He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . 1719.3284615572652
Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent <UNK> and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . " Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " You cannot have a right to such very strong <UNK> attachment . 1305.119180456487
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry . 2234.0501791183233
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . " However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather <UNK> , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . 2298.3963226262354
She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <UNK> in so small a family as her ' s , and <UNK> her as to the care of her <UNK> and her poultry . 2598.3060811548253
Society , I own , is necessary to me . 4629.201501582409
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <UNK> ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had <UNK> , in his offer to herself . 3000.102889817551
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . " " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the <UNK> manner which I see so many women ' s do . 1794.52101641373
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . 1309.7500713175075
Now what have you to say ? " " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . " Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . 2877.68321374172
They are gone off together from Brighton . 1739.682433211115
Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <UNK> . 1723.5034547190448
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . 1947.2796316811464
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . 998.2646074241255
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . 1736.7009174731718
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . 1731.319083865701
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? 2571.8231130892136
Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> . 1370.5319570353608
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost . 2027.8536549711841
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " With such kind of <UNK> of their parties and good <UNK> , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . 2017.2575202236833
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . 1316.7717481966108
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ' s . 1910.677241135247
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . 1595.5248391753023
CHAPTER XIX . 1263.0515403986196
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . " " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be . 1579.1285962383017
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 1308.6920742144391
I knew that Mr . Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . 1326.258359651535
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . 1315.3836765312046
By Mrs . 1133.6359062803915
<UNK> , teazing , man ! 2344.0143203371617
But it is of small importance . " " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and <UNK> me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? 2650.279708105308
But I will no longer <UNK> my young cousin . " Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his <UNK> at backgammon . 2262.9349347102693
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself . 2566.691071566939
Have you had any flirting ? 6229.490808370395
To <UNK> <UNK> or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www . gutenberg . org donate While we cannot and do not solicit <UNK> from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no <UNK> against accepting <UNK> donations from <UNK> in such states who approach us with offers to donate . 2582.518234048182
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . 1381.1406676108818
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . 1570.9762328020997
It was to this effect " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well . 2330.84919550286
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 2219.5015457746426
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 2141.285031428262
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 2215.6720689872495
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 1980.9523055222312
Poor little Lizzy ! 372.3606769628468
Miss Bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . 887.2826349828377
was not a man to be trusted . 3036.090221351888
This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better . 1931.944614775908
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . " " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us . 2118.567981080388
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 2699.3625056050223
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 1295.7402446168599
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . 1525.7242015606978
What is it you are talking of ? 4648.5289597966
They saw him often , and to his other <UNK> was now added that of general <UNK> . 2745.835766574841
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 2533.12541784067
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . 3349.262778138409
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . 1283.4542044322534
Will you come and see me ? " " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . " " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . 1716.8703294444101
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 1997.3785438383932
They had frequently been staying with her in town . 2747.674831627779
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . 2370.998869570136
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . 2083.415553060406
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 1955.0764016108244
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . 2633.379133586026
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 1406.265198483106
He could number the <UNK> in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <UNK> . 1550.3159193534634
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 1676.021779233248
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
He is gone to my father already . 1560.1392316199742
Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise . 1228.2227757105436
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side . 1598.7871817839905
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . 1424.2899676911265
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . 1585.1723569837313
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time . 1078.9966947219007
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as , by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . 1188.2231510895408
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . 1475.4692779267682
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much . 2354.564637763829
Good bye . " She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she <UNK> about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . 2725.6061736981733
what does he say ? 2746.7118966667986
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 1809.9762250922086
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . 1606.601881205224
My feelings in every respect forbid it . 1119.3918674537235
He is a pleasant fellow , and would <UNK> you <UNK> . " " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 1749.1418306706626
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever . 1733.062925445388
CHAPTER IX . 1263.0515403986196
What are we to do ! " would they often <UNK> in the bitterness of <UNK> . 3461.9768812903653
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 2506.830322922814
But do not imagine that he is always here so often . 2541.4063492677733
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 2777.4526665493
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 3606.9498697828094
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted <UNK> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <UNK> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . 2666.4072706997135
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 1681.4952076619463
Gardiner . 863.5921880730651
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 3738.2629842636647
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement . 1358.7066333698178
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . 1308.6336561770863
No , no , you shall not deceive me . 3740.1128536494457
Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go . 1188.186270612254
At length however Mrs . 442.805472308373
A <UNK> life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . 2864.2976035983615
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . 1747.9494322522723
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 3685.6333732337926
" Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss Bingley ; " and pray what is the result ? " " I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect . 1737.8835223450606
Kitty <UNK> and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . 1230.4856107233006
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and <UNK> to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head . 2675.477903303628
<UNK> that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . 2507.577294946347
Thank God ! 2425.9524544781325
Why must she be <UNK> about the country , because her sister had a cold ? 2358.609901128658
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however <UNK> its existence might prove , had at least <UNK> one day . 1732.8902464183261
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 1854.6117279672658
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! 2093.1602309176205
They had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister . 1096.5093153930532
What a good joke it will be ! 3217.150225068881
<UNK> such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 2459.6946574221975
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . " " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . 2092.0852335062054
her liveliness had been never worse <UNK> . 2213.7525065196673
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 1944.4941389491332
You supposed more than really existed . 2001.4391088389193
She dared not even mention that gentleman . 1222.8848990317706
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled . 1732.42444960424
She saw with the <UNK> eye of fancy , the <UNK> of that gay bathing place covered with officers . 2433.134645478876
What will Wickham say ? 956.7669971154575
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 1716.865856199759
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , glancing at her sister and Bingley , shall take place . 1087.2119192817381
Mr . Darcy is engaged to my daughter . 729.0503371552818
" Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . 792.9851677560013
That he was surprised by the <UNK> was evident ; he <UNK> it however with <UNK> , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner . 1871.6993413222556
It was gratitude . <UNK> , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <UNK> and <UNK> of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 3089.631085261679
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . 2454.434124328602
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 2598.415492538023
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 2874.8533265262813
Collins , did I tell you of Lady <UNK> ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? 1948.4230153210392
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . 3900.4343414287478
and so extremely accomplished for her age ! 2696.520433307516
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . 1637.6842373204897
" I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . 1822.353174332683
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 1629.5272203839543
Good Heaven ! 1493.5091240202632
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure . " The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs . 1553.7151270878605
At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . 1938.5409691366528
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the <UNK> of red <UNK> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 1192.1939006266527
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my <UNK> and <UNK> are not usually <UNK> by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of <UNK> ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . Pardon me . It pains me to offend you . 2258.919696105701
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 2083.7872858003557
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . 2263.097461558264
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 961.0008895364249
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " " But I was embarrassed . " " And so was I . " " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " " A man who had felt less , might . " " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 3085.489309637138
" If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . 1747.2604805180213
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and <UNK> , though <UNK> families . 3111.113653125662
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . 1324.906269143402
can it be really so ! 3540.580099885622
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <UNK> , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her <UNK> and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , Lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . 2602.1402755635327
" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 1818.711399750286
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . 1076.4254102712966
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 1596.6331938026021
She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . 2624.2937604305084
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge . 1139.2875325283437
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 1806.8717923397996
Such very superior dancing is not often seen . 1402.5444849278354
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 2099.9311185642277
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . 1857.9835406814266
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . 992.0602846853578
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . 4077.767393173937
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . 1444.2122892587531
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . 2315.351620225314
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 2913.2933763010356
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . 1857.8953603061886
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . " " Your first <UNK> is false . 3022.3353109757913
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room . 1276.2206816213957
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . 1900.7885937177407
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . 1429.9040311884667
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . 1833.1939716823595
If gratitude and esteem are good <UNK> of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 1643.978214624439
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it . 1393.5456615481298
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 1710.2262757657882
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means <UNK> or <UNK> , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . 2591.585518181555
" It may perhaps be pleasant , " replied Charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . 2370.5018180517645
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no <UNK> the frequent mention of Wickham ' s name . 1399.6987827011972
Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes . 2001.7061915610448
She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . 1617.4570008381959
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ; but his <UNK> about the whole Pemberley family are endless . 3164.6146459067513
For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . 2865.445990231409
<UNK> on Jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy ' s explanation , by <UNK> Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 1360.4210231349236
" Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . " He should be particularly happy at any time , c . 1743.2146477135302
It is Mr . Bingley I am sure . 1106.4032089033094
Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general <UNK> , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . 1513.7597543950692
I don ' t know . 3003.122918439373
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1665.6005668099872
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 1423.758965848858
Mr . Wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a <UNK> as she could . 1227.448554375449
Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . 1658.411172370539
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? 1140.3355576419992
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . 906.5335416630264
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed . 1830.5593382520346
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 1441.3261490661193
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a <UNK> , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , <UNK> to Kitty and Lydia . 1399.4147538561206
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 980.233896978625
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . 2380.1348541096545
Mr . Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . 1232.1704392218803
" Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? 1768.4384574872822
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . 2476.334807153956
Philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly <UNK> the invitation . 2549.9351857137945

Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! 1883.8033061848994
<UNK> there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or <UNK> . 2553.4968538533344
Are you going much farther ? " " No , I should have turned in a moment . " And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together . 2037.3893215896219
After a slight <UNK> for good news , the letter was read aloud . 1424.5984446102007
CHAPTER XIX . 1263.0515403986196
I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . 808.4241373177297
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 2313.361215798615
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . 754.3542351353009
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night . 2424.3786602006708
What a contrast between him and his friend ! 3722.6598410792058
" I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . 2938.8026060212496
And when you have given your ball , " she added , " I shall insist on their giving one also . 1692.4022417471367
Her mother ' s <UNK> , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . 1913.245246926279
All field <UNK> were over . 5937.852791907465
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . " " But my father cannot . He wrote last week to hurry my return . " " Oh ! 984.9770519703095
Where does discretion end , and <UNK> begin ? 3072.6026929448717
She comes to us to day . 1218.1971147934848
<UNK> , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ? 3387.4431965426324
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them . " This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret . 2408.115652049902
Nobody wants him to come . 1952.12922385337
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . 3898.860657055165
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true <UNK> will derive benefit from such as are given . 2123.0639248791745
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 2188.863189323204
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . 2320.9685325761225
That such a consequence as this should <UNK> , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . " " When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . " " Not the slightest . 2483.4263213946324
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
This was very amiable , but Charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . 1808.3711295675919
<UNK> has she condescended to give me her opinion <UNK> too ! on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our <UNK> at quadrille , while Mrs . 2636.5244082552904
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . 1211.7517680920269
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 1841.8194652685017
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <UNK> her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 2275.7493749333808
I am glad he <UNK> here on Tuesday . 3693.3773429095154
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . 3137.1454692145353
All was joy and kindness . 2767.761457831389
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . 1820.5041730189755
His temptation is not <UNK> to the risk . " " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment . 2462.285237859759
Your ' s , c . " Mr . Darcy ' s letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last . 1155.9211981188414
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . " " Is that his design in settling here ? " " <UNK> ! 2651.7935921790113
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . 2476.9474808575596
Bennet was <UNK> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and <UNK> in her <UNK> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the <UNK> happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 1773.2216236006864
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . 1952.8703323045647
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 1304.4616246408589
Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the <UNK> ? 1709.6155588875704
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its <UNK> was visiting and news . 1906.5015917957664
If your feelings are still what they were last <UNK> , tell me so at once . 2531.151061690923
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time . 776.3644212861595
Every thing <UNK> what is strong already . 1196.2398200554533
He <UNK> , and <UNK> , and makes love to us all . 2977.1228005547055
No thanks to his gallantry for that . 3992.8345861964312
They <UNK> it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . 1831.4886566395037
Mr . Darcy was <UNK> him with <UNK> wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . 1052.5355134219317
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . 2248.11761260445
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . 1293.6098053144053
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . 1893.258426166697
Yes , yes . 1331.5908205807348
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than <UNK> . 2742.603638622023
And his behaviour , so <UNK> altered , what could it mean ? 2123.307180912527
Jenkinson ' s room . 1751.0443420612216
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , Mrs . 1418.4882130979408
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 3658.714189597518
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . " " I am , " said he , with a firm voice . 3741.940647285578
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 1837.6196386150555
She continued in very <UNK> reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 1510.9857796944514
You must and shall be married by a special licence . 1530.828359521791
" It must not be thought of . 1988.9203758578908
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <UNK> than to herself . 2010.3211193991788
<UNK> and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was <UNK> and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . 1985.6982738128315
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings . 1434.9352608447537
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . 2064.2965203017056
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . 1181.2497539064855
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon . 2117.844660652714
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 2033.3905457071724
<UNK> to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . 1947.7351306243456
" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! 1592.6409966523374
The first week of their return was soon gone . 818.587066530253
The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . 2081.369955899121
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . 1883.0394806437425
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . 1672.9096929068348
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . 1775.558385924237
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . 1628.3166811971605
They were in street . 4246.5675070520965
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it <UNK> . 1778.0255832301082
At length , she spoke again . 2621.840451528776
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard <UNK> in any of the family . 2071.0448540452608
You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <UNK> is denied me , because you have always so much . " Mr . Bingley arrived . 1633.604476059864
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law . " The loss of her daughter made Mrs . 1180.9189029760216
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 2320.6835221231304
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . 1528.8088330610494
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . 1874.1566868121686
I remain , dear sir , with <UNK> compliments to your lady and daughters , your well <UNK> and friend , <UNK> <UNK> . " " At four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he <UNK> up the letter . 1606.5585053097209
" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? " " To morrow fortnight . " " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . 2479.560883482242
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 2044.9403084461692
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . 2623.0662163277907
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 1801.0748892257086
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . 1155.5792323928079
" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " His misfortunes ! " repeated Darcy <UNK> ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . " " And of your <UNK> , " cried Elizabeth with energy . 2534.8975800944404
I cannot understand it . 1460.243781300614
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 1545.5219993795686
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . 4082.367416696082
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 1905.3871042143164
single , my dear , to be sure ! 1893.244478723511
Lydia , my love , ring the bell . 1715.869323180494
Bennet . 467.6253030517642
And is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? 2838.028197703608
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before . 2725.4875429881936
She is almost three and twenty ! 1520.2758837813808
it cannot be . 2342.7488338162257
Bennet , " that is very unlucky . " " Can I have the carriage ? " said Jane . 2201.280540060082
It was a large , handsome , <UNK> building , standing well on rising ground , and <UNK> by a <UNK> of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was <UNK> into greater , but without any <UNK> appearance . 2562.0074439320883
What could your ladyship propose by it ? " " At once to insist upon having such a report universally <UNK> . " " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . " " If ! 2496.5631582213846
The t te t te surprised them . 2719.4094341615505
" Oh ! 1745.268895136781
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can <UNK> so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most <UNK> to a <UNK> ' s mind . 2495.8839553227695
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . 2991.3845131663284
Mr . Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . 987.109377240851
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 1208.8986309787804
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child . 937.9763513055183
At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! 2490.7857811288745
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . 1062.8665596011163
Hill began instantly to express her joy . 1056.5611862450876
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . 2275.8270586120957
I had no notion but he would go a <UNK> , or something or other , and not <UNK> us with his company . 2501.7394852884236
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . 2827.8576406701322
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <UNK> . 1828.700189992224
She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> . 2179.748114228099
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 1558.804772080683
" She is so fond of Mrs . 2493.762900258737
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . 2573.2996040440726
Her answer , therefore , was not <UNK> , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . 2002.3738487146989
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . 1805.0616901289416
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . " Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . 2605.9855934781053
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 1457.7501861770306
In a <UNK> voice Mrs . 1676.7530274080184
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 1597.814022855924
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his <UNK> . 2239.0214700988995
But think no more of the letter . 2082.161923133371
Here , <UNK> , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . 1824.085670304423
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . " " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . " " I beg your pardon . 2999.6314586836775
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <UNK> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . 1857.2355702836244
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 2263.697584441028
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . " Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . 2262.0576078066197
And who knows what may happen ? 1733.7559279592
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 2445.501369428877
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 1676.5323647095815
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 1541.7883308241135
I thought we never should have got into the coach . 1739.863941755238
<UNK> more than half a day ' s journey . 2129.2580873100214
" No ; but it must be done soon . " Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . 2313.9819847616864
There is nothing else to be done . 1381.8905066149923
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . 1630.706343231221
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 1299.7934888092677
Bennet was <UNK> the fire . 2018.522488523998
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . " " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . 2755.019218629102
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . 1686.6548870877793
but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley ' s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the <UNK> have no horses to theirs . " " I had much rather go in the coach . " " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure . 1947.2922983204894
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . 2404.7598092160365
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 1529.0628222620244
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more <UNK> purpose . 2681.7094276803828
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . 1427.2701874482805
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 1702.8565063202818
" Your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . 2327.3849297587144
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . 2079.4412654912003
They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . 2630.8040626240936
<UNK> he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 1895.1404445582994
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away . 1899.7254082133318
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 1619.3419094394533
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 2600.750112135625
<UNK> any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . " " Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . 1838.6278349490954
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly <UNK> . 2352.077319877104
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . 1572.9336060065236
Let Wickham be your man . 777.2788871725152
<UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . 1910.1701815227425
" Good Heaven ! 2201.655583739558
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 1612.1219897310475
We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation . 1863.3978912043242
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . 2472.238926048444
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . 1964.2439299222735
They have some of the finest woods in the country . " Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <UNK> . 1978.7926448836658
my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned . 1305.2490073853069
The vague and unsettled suspicions which <UNK> had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 2230.6220560602324
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . 2005.9359229099637
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 1785.9814495957673
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! 2986.5491913943
They could describe an entertainment with <UNK> , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . 2152.577857397214
<UNK> and <UNK> I can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart . 1714.0572250775208
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , <UNK> , absurd . 1390.576647821061
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 2215.9306311862847
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage . 1304.1586832749686
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . 1870.139389632616
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . 2579.501361455483
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . 2870.084304617526
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . 2179.1543079791004
so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! 1198.4253155302938
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . " " Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . " " And do you like her ? " " Very much . " " I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . 2288.433508759019
You take delight in <UNK> me . 2499.6401839659643
But what is that to me ? 7418.494454742295
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 1997.0051650831608
Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . 2243.488050225105
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over . 2362.1539929238206
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , <UNK> Lucases . 2505.4682654817475
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not <UNK> , but haughty . 3139.0040468558395
In <UNK> lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <UNK> in this interference . 1657.5295518355601
Gardiner ' s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are <UNK> against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 1897.751962099564
Jane now came up . 986.0767769596083
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . 1528.0896193309845
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <UNK> . 1133.8224725540165
She has known him only a fortnight . 2982.7587982185523
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy . 1247.8004380199513
That his anger could be carried to such a point of <UNK> resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem <UNK> , exceeded all that she could believe possible . 1381.1205931168686
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . 2761.2837418515705
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they <UNK> . 3347.667016228971
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 1570.0966909052115
Such were the gentle <UNK> of Mrs . 2840.4841387411902
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy . 2118.9194721869762
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
CHAPTER <UNK> . 2004.9693439188225
He is perfectly amiable . 1695.1336344096792
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget ' had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ' Those were your words . 1633.5340859428336
I am not <UNK> you know . 3392.6936636790833
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 970.7416254862181
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a <UNK> fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered <UNK> to the repeated <UNK> of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 2290.5920852802683
" Oh ! 1745.268895136781
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . 654.870974810808
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with . 2112.568113564481
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 1644.5393600942425
When this was done , she had a less active part to play . 2004.4563955641604
Kitty was the only one who <UNK> tears ; but she did <UNK> from vexation and envy . 2936.051972334506
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <UNK> recommendation , and to assert that I had <UNK> all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . 1933.7091105052516
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all <UNK> , was still <UNK> <UNK> . 2704.487172905484
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . " " Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . 2174.877147570984
I saw them the night before last . " Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . 1497.2228196801261
It is impossible for me to be impartial . 4140.451965252462
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 1169.532627140031
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 1550.865007190079
" You quite <UNK> Mr . Darcy . 851.9652482561742
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle . 1679.6723700868577
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 2309.962351544646
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . 1368.9513447163201
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . 1854.0389764792976
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . 1314.6379288951655
He owns it himself without disguise . " " No " said Darcy , " I have made no such pretension . 2183.085948619287
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B . 1999.5730987431755
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . 1629.8501122030714
The party did not supply much conversation . 988.8470648957749
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been <UNK> by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 2592.5057881387706
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . 1933.8250586522056
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . 1618.9338101162984
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . 2970.981482023243
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . 2170.317239122553
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 1261.5996909676312
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her <UNK> , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . 1999.9303217282766
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . 2402.512134959594
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas ' s last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the <UNK> were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three <UNK> <UNK> at least . 1472.420709902758
It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement . 1945.0639031660685
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 2158.115016217239
" Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " for Mrs . 1152.1085014177384
He was well , but so much engaged with Mr . Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . 938.1531310854492
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my <UNK> from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . 2339.3421623280046
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 1290.5058509549879
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . 2177.5124000469505
They came . 1764.2406955515287
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . " " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an <UNK> , <UNK> disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will <UNK> the whole room , and be handed down to <UNK> with all the <UNK> of a <UNK> . " " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he . 2204.059381368012
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Dear , dear Lizzy . 780.988195301711
and his sisters are charming women . 1695.3116437067386
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? " " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . " " Oh ! 2447.602279080522
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for <UNK> Lodge , the <UNK> are dreadful . " Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . 2294.391453966171
If this be the case , he deserves you . 4385.153641235473
II . 3764.3110762416654
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! 1530.833212318003
As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it <UNK> and lovely as ever . 1687.9912705269392
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " Their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . 1303.768736195029
Philips first brought her the news . " Well , so much the better . 1005.8741603346743
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the <UNK> of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . 1494.8384485035222
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? 2782.9541063761117
And to be kept back on such a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . " " Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? " " With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . " Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . 1503.8495507589018
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . " <UNK> as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat <UNK> , she had all the success she expected . 2176.903819590318
He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . 1760.1007112842647
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . 2601.6006592897834
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . 2076.2626787096924
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 1279.1083850741213
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 1331.4817651325786
Mr . and Mrs . 621.271393568558
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the <UNK> of my father ' s will , has been <UNK> acquainted with every particular of these transactions . 2043.370976666089
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 1448.135100373572
Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a <UNK> season , made her feel that the <UNK> , <UNK> , most thread bare <UNK> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <UNK> . 1751.8959928931974
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 2200.0736545821005
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . 2384.5757062733965
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr . Darcy . 1602.3311443142386
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an <UNK> of Mr . Darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . 1579.7236319825654
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . " " I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a kingdom ! 2581.480257831202
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . 2030.529531644746
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . 1519.8151242211245
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . 1100.4856554029259
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . 1602.0624478497402
He comes down on Thursday at the <UNK> , very likely on Wednesday . 3432.952264896563
Jane was by no means better . 958.6214605387438
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . 2176.539617257065
The journey would moreover give her a <UNK> at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . 1510.348664789768
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . 1458.319362919533
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , <UNK> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 1751.995404176401
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to <UNK> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . 1643.1124669706358
Give me farther particulars . 1623.3449512342686
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 2000.4028215069807
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 1838.1436386977803
<UNK> sons cannot marry where they like . " " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . " " Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . " " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl ' s younger son ? 2134.645396265755
Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the <UNK> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . 2152.893017575737
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . 1430.3147883749364
But pride where there is a real <UNK> of mind , pride will be always under good <UNK> . " Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . 1445.0135226331427
It <UNK> , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . 1990.6543918637212
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s . 4163.418750565901
By this time she is actually with them ! 3053.5622401752817
Forster . 1330.8849442530561
But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he <UNK> that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 2156.0417037486527
She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most <UNK> by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . 2009.7720707142541
Forster , the delight of Mrs . 1194.3349445825168
<UNK> , <UNK> , . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations . 4401.054996885114
Her colour changed , and she said no more . 2491.0595967817335
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 737.195090028658
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to <UNK> this estate after the death of your honoured father , who , however , may live many years longer , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . 1619.427782983085
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <UNK> have alarmed her . 3336.364223082095
But I will not repine . 5721.076536095295
We will go round the Park every day . 753.7106584603995
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 4497.925021579758
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned . 2307.3855436584336
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . 1571.5949217294212
" You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age . " " I am not one and twenty . " When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . 2513.6216971055505
You do not look well . 1593.8074753457274
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . 1374.7272855630672
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . 2182.9932332164126
CHAPTER XVI . 1263.0515403986196
" Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane ' s . " CHAPTER XVIII . 1175.208371918332
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 2833.973358946131
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company . 1397.5516953842402
Mr . Darcy ! and so it does I <UNK> . 2296.0371061195096
But when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ' s <UNK> all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 2240.0059537820957
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " <UNK> in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . 1653.0915069859932
who attended to you ? 3976.5324579403223
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 2668.746128666204
Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master . 1783.360966162168
Mr . Darcy may <UNK> himself . " " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried Elizabeth . 1053.7548912984776
<UNK> him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her . 3032.430835765762
Can I speak <UNK> ? 3274.792192458253
and what can he have to say ? " " Something very much to the purpose of course . 2665.480597599544
But she would not be secure . 2114.070697194673
For God ' s sake , say no more of his partners . 3052.1170345109026
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . 2480.1062309838967
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile it was decided . 1575.1891702707405
The <UNK> or <UNK> of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining <UNK> . 3367.86693859236
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
<UNK> will be absolutely <UNK> , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . 2276.446017941461
. F . . LIMITED <UNK> OF <UNK> OR <UNK> If you discover a defect in this electronic work within days of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from . 2391.4506845821106
Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment . 1002.9555068208099
No , never . 2009.8273784522669
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 2005.2898069293228
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen . 2500.2971124687697
We acted with the best intentions . " " Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " He brought it with him for us to see . " Jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to Elizabeth . 1788.9629016979238
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . 2168.321667078292
You may have drawn him in . " " If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . " " Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? 2199.913238203336
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . 2221.0806734505727
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . 1277.3679433584468
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . " " Oh ! 1415.1223236473907
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . 1464.2327311139084
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . 1910.8454511371274
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . 2124.1691531386186
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . 1574.7451251406405
" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! 3131.6560193150995
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a <UNK> profit c <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under the laws of the state of <UNK> and <UNK> tax exempt status by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . 2071.0307151954707
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? 1690.7143795779086
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . 2496.39725441028
After walking several miles in a <UNK> manner , and too <UNK> to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their <UNK> , that it was time to be at home . 2196.5762504340514
Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 1378.4195894232867
" I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 1866.3254743155894
" You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . 1913.1264983689264
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to <UNK> these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 1896.3658204085223
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of <UNK> , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 2297.2892489133806
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 991.3764700769717
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
" I am , dear Sir , c . 1940.6108428065743
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity . 3116.8288834026716
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 1795.1050889644023
Is nothing due to me on that score ? 2641.032090398156
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some <UNK> in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . 1960.6002153125967
Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn . 1423.396568650258
CHAPTER II . 1172.5131852383306
A thousand things may arise in six months ! " The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . 1357.0874721312443
CHAPTER XV . 1263.0515403986196
Poor Jane ! 554.5607048231839
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must <UNK> him from such <UNK> misconduct as I have suffered by . 2973.9709055359476
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . 1998.5081662502953
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . 1670.236218618677
and it was not wholly without foundation . 2103.538013713621
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . 2677.697383224359
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 1837.366888297701
But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! 1770.734855143309
I know you will contrive it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . 2061.4936510596754
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 2232.7571538126845
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . 1305.3934044772568
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 2544.5605581489604
<UNK> to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . 2617.7409151508737
" <UNK> Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at <UNK> , if the drawing room were larger ; but <UNK> is too far off ! 2131.029090955531
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . " Mrs . 1528.2404853800385
These recollections will not do at all . 5601.350203317014
I can recal nothing worse . 1715.1044302110845
His revenge would have been complete indeed . 1313.2881099558053
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . 932.4685870693836
" Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " I have , Sir . " " Very well . 2608.368339592269
CHAPTER XIV . 1263.0515403986196
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was <UNK> her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs . 1918.5077250866188
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . 1935.7763418321695
Poor dear child ! 632.2954364770851
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
. E . . If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart , the owner of the Project Gutenberg tm trademark . 1229.9147550884074
My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . 1238.419085422325
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . 1628.4233684054875
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of <UNK> on Mr . Collins ' s side , and as many bows on Sir William ' s , they departed . 2252.5656958663153
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . 1961.3515423766166
She will not be able to help calling . " " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 1803.5552685619657
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 2392.4522867236046
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? " " Oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all . 2663.221460328634
How is such a man to be worked on ? 3766.5046979655453
Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . 1731.165998627152
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . 1358.2071261183632
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . 2608.4877851120555
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . 1818.0670564233642
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 2583.7434094583705
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room . 1340.3700002163073
We were always good friends ; and now we are better . " " True . 2038.9177885279398
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 1839.8675561797666
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . 3653.822275769984
Bennet . They had several children . 1287.7208393232445
" There is nothing the matter with me . 2852.4724299616346
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . 2350.3773423850416
Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . 2308.472833069558
He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? 1873.8244743768219
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to <UNK> from the <UNK> qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . 2668.1780109674855
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 1495.2226243997582
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 1308.9449920895152
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . 2757.2776904641814
But I dare not hope it . 2197.185266751221
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . 3091.0655177481635
In the dining room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before . 1798.7165042031213
I am so pleased so happy . 2342.17237112033
Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 659.9134350310995
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that . 2400.6193202710188
At that moment , she cared for no other . 3875.237954908683
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can ' t write ; so I will <UNK> , and you write for me . 3366.652697442593
" He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived . 2119.5829049595586
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <UNK> ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 2478.019462697128
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . " Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire . 2091.972689564596
Mr . Wickham ' s chief object was <UNK> my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of <UNK> himself on me , was a strong inducement . 1721.323940814072
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs . 1804.8764180272567
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia . 1882.6619291619184
He drew a chair near her . 2169.8569982464364
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 1578.1361690410688
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . " " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger . 2341.306027124615
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this <UNK> . 2125.2872029008477
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever <UNK> , and the <UNK> friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . 1179.0710647674398
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 1145.2876247331922
You know my sentiments . " " You are then resolved to have him ? " " I have said no such thing . 2810.85786348125
And what sort of table do they keep ? 2263.9577444100514
Mr . Bennet accepted the <UNK> , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . 1832.0769883698667
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . 1570.9702730262684
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " " You may as well call it impertinence at once . 3153.237590449615
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . " " I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your <UNK> what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . 2660.616522456115
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . 2141.0355033285223
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 1285.794634589259
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . 1563.7302632731878
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 1357.5806706243231
<UNK> you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters . 1668.236196640457

why is not every body as happy ? " Elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . 1572.0138186074835
Their reception at home was most kind . 1939.7105548057377
She had also to <UNK> how her visit would pass , the quiet <UNK> of their usual employments , the vexatious <UNK> of Mr . Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings . 2115.0419319312723
He was very fond of them . " This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham ' s being among them . 2244.760065845192
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . 2263.5710072213324
Dear me ! 4367.0471708180075
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well . 482.846676437823
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 2177.216458976783
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance <UNK> , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . 1702.9816088067498
" But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . " " <UNK> , headstrong girl ! 1566.067068271084
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 1445.2606205789093
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 4761.664554313593
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and <UNK> , and talk and laugh all the way home . 1259.7512166664385
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 1921.409790073874
Bennet , " I am quite delighted with him . 1889.8635992337665
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 1921.5974812740305
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . 2000.9961458070136
Jane was not happy . 1006.8302117621523
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . 2322.1330205841004
My father , however , is partial to Mr . Wickham . 974.3840839899898
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ? 3373.419648130737
Jane <UNK> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour . 965.7860948128846
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference . 1424.8600939117944
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . 3227.2291331107217
how rich and how great you will be ! 3180.7180051554546
" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . 1356.0176002754974
" Mrs . 1133.6359062803915
" When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! I who knew what he was . 2780.767331344024
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . 1826.6480626392113
<UNK> that may be , you are <UNK> to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs . 2986.4528341647715
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . 2473.6561574171305
Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 1669.9459361300567
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 2552.1777885725523
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative . 1811.5913682919788
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by <UNK> a <UNK> , or covering a <UNK> . 2988.8637753847033

Collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too . 1604.014308132462
There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . 1942.9097259260584
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <UNK> of a bad day . 1244.3852664626409
" Are you not diverted ? " " Oh ! 4038.4473393986436

Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 2074.953628249196
You have employed your time much better . 792.70377234637

She studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . 1291.5806221432279
They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . " " <UNK> a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . 1242.846947041048
I had not an idea of it . " Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . 1408.2383861286753
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . " They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . 1827.6881427949668
Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . 2517.0300016323795
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . 1024.1331544041898
I know your disposition , Lizzy . 1108.1053827273383
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . 1455.325471451802
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . 1635.396970139587
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . 2725.58784490824
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister . 1640.2850920523567
what felicity ! 2973.8594067214362
Elizabeth was <UNK> enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 1066.1739565217001
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . 937.5006936315364
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . 1038.1737794071744
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? " Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . 1539.394143802332
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot . 381.9191272382132
" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . " Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . 2197.7692385633545
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that <UNK> is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . 2056.552449096169
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with <UNK> civility , " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ? 1418.4581000123942
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation . 1177.0728034718784
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 2071.899763217085
Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father . 2229.477071414875

And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! 2537.2477324833044
<UNK> as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> . 2588.269546273058
" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . 2472.799276659201
Lady Catherine de Bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . 1288.5096845065539
And poor Mr . Darcy ! 511.2455514433496
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? 2507.065364473686
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was . 1484.9679228387836

" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party . 2314.2444288771926
Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . 1136.348211632052

Miss Darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . 1244.241777155831
Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ' s arm <UNK> to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s . 2239.6243065702392
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . 1953.818608635619
What relates to yourself , is as follows . 4926.259667872728
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 1138.2825717651094
She then took a large house in <UNK> street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . 2101.157033473448
Elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several <UNK> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . 2122.4413735356616
They were hopeless of remedy . 4404.91519393797
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? " " Yes ; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . 1525.4737535464935
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ? 1953.2805108766074
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 1598.436035916823
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 1742.9143508226227

no , no , this is not likely . 4868.925557864967

One came from her books , and the other from her toilette . 3120.034303437013
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . 1565.1620230292265
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 1747.2568415818005
He studies too much for words of four <UNK> . Do not you , Darcy ? " " My style of writing is very different from yours . " " Oh ! " cried Miss Bingley , " Charles <UNK> in the most careless way imaginable . 2062.849238908399
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <UNK> on such a research ; in which <UNK> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally <UNK> , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . 2566.5144638110355

Bennet was <UNK> engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <UNK> them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather <UNK> than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . 1811.3184789672616
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . 1152.933333093106

Yet he is such a man ! " " Yes , yes , they must marry . 1750.1524326302733
In understanding Darcy was the superior . 1322.538328896045
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! 1522.4368854840493

To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 2174.006424531248
I write without any intention of <UNK> you , or <UNK> myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the <UNK> , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . 2491.524148626145
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 2030.7647801758853

I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 3290.8786588177077
Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . 1115.0480211981483
Its banks were neither formal , nor <UNK> adorned . 3215.458741359742
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself <UNK> watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . 769.9506890485077
She was overpowered by shame and vexation . 3403.8261435427926
But no such recollection <UNK> her . 5142.579470715093
His reception however was of the most flattering kind . 2005.207128074085
I am very , very sorry . 4446.178023421193
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . 1292.2472368877561
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . 2070.0923300121185
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 1118.819410830541
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 1407.9461160279952
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . 1445.8981598830305
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ' s <UNK> , and complimented her on bearing it so well . 2419.2330558453505
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . " " That is his notion of christian forgiveness ! 2760.526437268482
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged . 2193.3988514111584
no . I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . " " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may <UNK> our different opinions . " " No I cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . " " The present always <UNK> you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt . 2077.874890103081
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , <UNK> over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in <UNK> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 1476.7958764158307
You mentioned two instances . 1055.2726290130504
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield . 1105.9549027305661
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 1710.5409087564356
I shall now know how to act . 1475.9917342511744
Pray , how violent was Mr . Bingley ' s love ? " " I never saw a more promising inclination . 1353.521178834035
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged <UNK> of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . 1865.3347207923525
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . 3961.8838500974766
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 2140.39655620235
Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . 455.4639577691016
Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . 1202.991663177796
I thought it my duty to give the <UNK> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well <UNK> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . 2126.418615847393
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . 2304.054360239508
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled . " A gentleman and a stranger ! 1906.2911506860723
" If they had uncles enough to <UNK> all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one <UNK> less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . 1461.679474139175
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other . 2076.420857773906
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
The fee is owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg tm trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation . 1645.1093266483258
nonsense , how can you talk so ! 3671.745311311847
That he has neither integrity nor honour . 2492.855581854635
It was a fortnight since Mrs . 1154.3423421839766
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 3140.4524614269562
<UNK> them next to your great uncle the judge . 1470.5317309136274
" You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . 864.7034634124383
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <UNK> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . 2450.4432082952267
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . 1317.8691605294327
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . 1638.5727021494924
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your <UNK> . " " I should imagine not . " " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . 2485.8921405669466
Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . 2294.4635159664276
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 1566.481363374951
" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . 894.2266486713277
But these things happen so often ! 1645.494860838639
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the <UNK> Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . 1702.7856586145044
Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . " " To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart . 1834.31178418973
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . 2768.0599313571156
" If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . 2989.500608227865
yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . 1747.7699117014001
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . 930.8069005593474
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 1205.3645535156272
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 1610.3732487081538
Reynolds was of no trifling nature . 2574.395175850909
Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active <UNK> , and when immediately before my father ' s death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . " " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth . 1854.3567952203014
With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were <UNK> understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged . 1590.289693968108
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she <UNK> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . " Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . 1935.170123890494
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a <UNK> denial , and ride off as fast as I could . " " Would Mr . Darcy then consider the <UNK> of your original intention as <UNK> for by your obstinacy in <UNK> to it ? " " Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . " " You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . 2043.3692144659358
Forster and me are such friends ! and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? 2878.1928500055465
<UNK> such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not <UNK> the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . 2153.367045508054
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <UNK> by Wickham . 2613.0321938125307
CHAPTER VIII . 1263.0515403986196
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 3063.6421949132446
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . " Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . 1298.4346884197137
Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . 1678.7482627484067
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . 3214.370201612123
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . 1425.9949787606652
<UNK> these efforts , Project Gutenberg tm electronic works , and the medium on which they may be <UNK> , may contain " <UNK> , " such as , but not limited to , <UNK> , <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> errors , a copyright or other intellectual property <UNK> , a defective or <UNK> <UNK> or other medium , a computer <UNK> , or computer <UNK> that <UNK> or cannot be read by your equipment . 3265.071194801847
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned . 2316.8994180945574
That is the place to get husbands . 2128.9010699800397
Poor Lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . 1969.5400131461133
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 2039.749737218716
You cannot have been always at Longbourn . " Elizabeth looked surprised . 815.4196156571126
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 1778.373644408193
He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . " " Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . " He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . 1749.7280320304317
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 2012.4326668140134
<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 1885.6539302648307
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 2130.8469627993513
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a <UNK> library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read <UNK> . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose <UNK> ' s <UNK> . 2172.9613984958573
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . 1850.0893290079866
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . 1440.9121750754716
She felt <UNK> the justice of Mr . Darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 1615.1072722837964
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . 1644.7659431277052
Very nonsensical to come at all ! 3210.139956682221
" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet ' s manor . 1940.3771167451043
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . 1495.9988090640625
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . 3194.9078602654486
Mr . Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . 1785.4644587437629
Reynolds could interest her on no other point . 1269.370842878298
Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . " CHAPTER XIII . 3218.4104959673878
With them he is remarkably agreeable . " " I do not believe a word of it , my dear . 2820.209356056654
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . 776.8282416576079
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling <UNK> on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give . 2104.6823132016007
" She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . 2935.276232581938
came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the <UNK> , and at the <UNK> in Barnet and <UNK> , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . 3096.3004670183236
Adieu to disappointment and <UNK> . 3848.047862244321
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 1405.1448100239763

It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . 4122.376499707017
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon <UNK> deliberation , you find that the misery of <UNK> his two sisters is more than <UNK> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . " " How can you talk so ? " said Jane <UNK> smiling , " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . " " I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . " " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 1915.0135933723352
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother . 1189.5551893928127
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . " CHAPTER V . 2102.660507297754
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas . 2722.9552131480677
If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 1313.5561904108263
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in <UNK> affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? 2307.5486188895447
His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry <UNK> , his wife may teach him . 2146.67085486502
CHAPTER XIV . 1263.0515403986196
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 1599.6624283845501
Elizabeth longed to <UNK> its <UNK> ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . 2354.1704517576313
