14.224353339853424
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . 12.239783238528501
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . 15.929594216207386
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 16.87993423561045
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . 7.090364662678054
His character was decided . 7.567257297876449
Yes , yes . 4.324999874843485
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design . 11.543694457186225
But when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ' s <UNK> all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 20.31266569122523
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to <UNK> his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be <UNK> <UNK> . 15.558525654502898
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . 8.69230599507266
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . 8.365146862108945
" I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five <UNK> any object . 14.970243060031748
Good bye . 7.838307134527496
It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . 18.142208759766042
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . 9.585662314672327
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . 7.290830922192747
Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 14.809787509484167
You cannot have been always at Longbourn . " Elizabeth looked surprised . 8.977667972458983
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . 20.3571979549278
" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? " " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . " " La ! " replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . 10.517815400427045
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 17.954707783603972
yes ; there is nothing in that . 5.615208180623839
I know it to be impossible . " " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! 9.142881020761179
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . " " I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . " " Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . " " That is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . 13.242568463705922
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 7.655879887472442
" Oh ! 3.580881536246356
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 13.760289970116341
I am not qualified to form one . 7.49998338060612
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to <UNK> , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to <UNK> his prosperous love . 27.783476928287417
that abominable Mr . Darcy ! My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to <UNK> it . 13.504285960261603
" Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " I have , Sir . " " Very well . 8.467184745256478
Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the <UNK> ? 17.86646338492804
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . 16.64108848609354
Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her . 13.705138721920447
A great deal more passed at the other table . 11.896967235608395
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . 12.461110397342138
At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s <UNK> him entirely , for she was a most determined <UNK> ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making <UNK> and exclaiming after <UNK> , to have attention for any one in particular . 30.949124157342865
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the <UNK> . 21.180919937712112
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh . 10.299910752773345
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal . " " True . 10.5862062516369
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? 15.594567752638937
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will <UNK> you ; and so generous , that you will always <UNK> your income . " " I hope not so . 13.84973441171593
" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . " Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . 14.744733705228164
His letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in <UNK> business , he was quick in its execution . 21.83952772732905
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . 12.287584752407227
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage . 16.772811775773885
" I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr . Darcy ! " " It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . " " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . " " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . " " <UNK> ! 12.547180081777416
The dejection was almost universal . 12.957888376432713
" My dear , dear aunt , " she <UNK> cried , " what delight ! 9.274407901088546
" She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . 10.286944673542717
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 21.060006141333076
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ' s folly . " " Indeed you are mistaken . 21.02999700541478
Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . 12.640035818620943
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 14.673163595914257
You deserve no such attention . 8.75183588931757
The evening passed quietly , <UNK> by any thing extraordinary . 18.724535257941525
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 16.92027178248373
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 11.654334498000736
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr . <UNK> . 13.653946862987548
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . 13.252920766008614
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 8.740074261565143
how he must have felt it ! " " I never saw any one so shocked . 9.033564683086048
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over <UNK> , as I always am . 10.101279200795581
It was first broken by Mrs . 7.663126791284186
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . " " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be <UNK> beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen . 14.855484567350766
I cannot quite agree with you there . 7.4066235359647985
Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . 9.118402959128188
You know him too well to doubt the rest . 8.12687644731933
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by <UNK> the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . 19.918410140492163
Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . 14.906329836828816
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 12.937612141700475
CHAPTER VIII . 6.932646313148128
GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . 11.054068041824314
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 10.009003260005743
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . 7.312431086039209
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . 18.852846853288543
But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . 5.664133980214419
Again she read on . 7.511009231196427
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . 12.838415156275765
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . " " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . 10.691955123416902
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of <UNK> , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 20.868187613401627
Jenkinson ' s room . 6.144553719208614
She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <UNK> in so small a family as her ' s , and <UNK> her as to the care of her <UNK> and her poultry . 17.187639582600326
. 1.3085768265604334
But who was your mother ? 6.325934195761132
Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . 15.267335701651785
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . " <UNK> ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 14.82485359731949
What <UNK> money , what <UNK> , what carriages you will have ! 19.152792807249416
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago . 19.58156214474353
Bennet and Mrs . 2.7693030465876016
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had <UNK> <UNK> only four months ago , would now have been <UNK> and gratefully received ! 22.29034168002808
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was <UNK> her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs . 12.913937164555064
They <UNK> as expeditiously as possible ; and <UNK> one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day . 24.069559316129265
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . 13.670837523761852
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 13.997151712104007
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , <UNK> love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means <UNK> , though it could not be exactly defined . 16.19185994401042
Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . 10.824842753489532
Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go . 8.602612066866445
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 11.837825556293048
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? 15.049174563949167
But do not imagine that he is always here so often . 9.36127137434762
Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c . 10.804834158069356
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr . Bennet , have you no more <UNK> <UNK> in which Lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " " I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs . 13.899105947973746
CHAPTER IX . 6.932646313148128
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention . 14.470090976074365
That is all settled . " " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . 9.905011035426268
I think she will be pleased with the <UNK> . " Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs . 17.247292536348926
Pray , how violent was Mr . Bingley ' s love ? " " I never saw a more promising inclination . 11.534690656915343
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 13.90903338163848
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her <UNK> of Mrs . 10.771211344027364
I never saw such <UNK> , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " Mrs . 9.306325225794417
It is impossible for me to be impartial . 7.532829686275496
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <UNK> manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . 23.00157245949234
Jane was distressed . 4.53113575127722
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <UNK> , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . 13.782718449291135
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . 11.778840202050409
no . " " I can much more easily believe Mr . Bingley ' s being imposed on , than that Mr . Wickham should <UNK> such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , <UNK> , every thing mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr . Darcy contradict it . 15.817273175919098
But however he did not . 4.570405224193688
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and <UNK> way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to morrow evening . 17.139639945984353
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . 18.3620746001692
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of <UNK> , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . 18.805745301788406
Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day . 19.331605061186647
That lady I suppose is your mother . " Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . 9.946352670510143
She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs . 6.180685307899169
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . 6.698829667844727
" From what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs . 6.536427423734651
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short <UNK> . " " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . 13.942691447885352
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 18.810285483737605
When the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a <UNK> to her mother ' s <UNK> for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . 20.322225923630338
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can <UNK> a woman . " " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? 13.339147466247098
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and <UNK> heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 11.868984351059863
Bennet very dull for several days . 11.840195786615647
The morrow produced no <UNK> of Mrs . 14.342487264859193
Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him . 9.270932822628316
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her . 9.37935690727085
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as , by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . 15.211400016658828
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . 21.18633428947437
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 9.308195961230515
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . 13.710100826827045
Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? 22.177756625282235
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle . 10.196196149754378
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . 12.935864650020745
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 15.573939235918782
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , <UNK> , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . 29.33662481723432
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it . 8.726894088961842
Collins so before you came . 5.508285315190439
" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . 12.1217147095586
<UNK> the Foundation as set forth in Section below . 23.93824010982869
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 16.59971727165116
But she is nothing to me now . 4.775754241009113
There is one point , on which I want your advice . 9.461561627136842
I knew how it would be . 4.779055438228955
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . 18.297329909377453
Oh , sister ! 4.149958956821426
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . 28.814464868306914
" <UNK> Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at <UNK> , if the drawing room were larger ; but <UNK> is too far off ! 19.340810727963117
One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 17.329853640506336
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! 16.57283036648066
it is of no consequence . 4.018409603196478
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . 17.378206062481574
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner ' s hope of Lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its <UNK> . 19.120932475293518

They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . " CHAPTER IV . 14.57063239024237
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 10.490334964013394

But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . 15.914534289292975

You do not look well . 6.011781670688561
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 17.88051757292842
" How could you begin ? " said she . 6.046482702470548
and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! 7.273354809039846
They had long wished to see him . 6.868621282901036
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 24.77627695569215
The <UNK> would be spoilt by <UNK> a fourth . 26.612925640130758
' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! What , all five out at once ? 11.869948098667441
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of <UNK> from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a <UNK> horse . 31.948889079134375
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 10.080353994285867
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . " " What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? 13.54357816996212
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 8.984434429219643
Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . 17.282721036347844
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . 20.70032481989567
" Oh ! 3.580881536246356
What shall we do with him ? 8.166280428903343
Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . 18.20785553965341
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 17.081972779559404
But what is that to me ? 4.631250246630604
It would be dreadful ! 7.453449557338332
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever <UNK> , and the <UNK> friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . 13.816856259363194
From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . 20.800337165499613
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling . 19.572045266083734
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you ! 8.547375350353006

She turned from sister to sister , <UNK> their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . 14.35869543882174
Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , <UNK> him I believe very early in life . 17.72804900756722
His surprise was great . 6.12201740867188

On both sides it was only assertion . 14.77763765231667
" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . 11.375999276996504
Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . 17.660459133120618
<UNK> , of course . If you mention my name at the <UNK> , you will be attended to . " Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . 14.284520888871802
<UNK> of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where . 21.640099394666574
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 26.51050300760782
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 8.116725392619736
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . 18.011161757129624
Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s sufferings . 16.71397751081077
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <UNK> . 17.194692276065304
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . " Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of <UNK> such reflections . 19.5213020819034
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much . 14.236439493464614
She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . 17.751526990088532
" You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 9.472017964793496
He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these <UNK> had arisen his principal <UNK> . 18.456907057675174
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . 16.998510731195026
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 6.809237885310514
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " " Oh ! 11.694851731400462
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 11.539594770061308
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 8.739911159807203
But still he would be her husband . Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . 25.435760436013304
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged <UNK> of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . 21.76564733857174
I am most seriously displeased . " Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . 16.498043787948543
Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in <UNK> . 16.648787812048948
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 12.75089701568548
I am sure I <UNK> ' <UNK> get a wink of sleep all night . 24.438643276990145
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 11.614802366389679
<UNK> wore a happier aspect . 28.921590130379546
" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she . 6.176438684356925
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Kitty <UNK> and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . 13.245710295585557
Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? 10.273245994434063
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? 7.426423646601161
But I must write no more . 6.052365722498799
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 10.277894037567686
" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . " " It is no such thing . 11.032018789183555
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of <UNK> them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <UNK> , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the <UNK> kind . " She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <UNK> by any feeling of <UNK> . 22.236938652993462
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . 10.657402861715159
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . 10.259471531790709
Elizabeth was <UNK> enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 11.005013457960494
<UNK> as she was to admit an idea so <UNK> of Jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the <UNK> of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . 19.691036631259294
He replied , and was again silent . 5.256035252165803
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished . 15.610868877016872
Philips were now <UNK> of the most interesting intelligence . 15.581570953632221
But Mrs . 2.9020612508168098
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . 12.735407900138227
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must <UNK> him from such <UNK> misconduct as I have suffered by . 13.568921079539813
It <UNK> , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . 20.809822072784595
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? 30.128926595444273
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " " But I was embarrassed . " " And so was I . " " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " " A man who had felt less , might . " " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 11.728347231884058
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 16.589459267926856
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 10.159392429258613
" Oh ! 3.580881536246356
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . 10.672776249185823
Four nieces of Mrs . 8.007132784585664
My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his <UNK> in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . 19.39044283438482
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . " Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . 16.408695761109907
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . 17.911914290326514
If he fears me , why come hither ? 16.2497871181651
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . 12.277068343078787
No , no , let me <UNK> for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret . 12.190907339837521
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 11.453949621578484
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . 10.177191437122822
Bennet . 2.090760509885019
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! 21.175382325083756
Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . 8.758761827050622
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 16.402141906897363
II . 4.190188405314571
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . " And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr . Collins thus addressed her , " When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from <UNK> you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . " " <UNK> , Mr . Collins , " cried Elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly . 17.9214326536432
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a <UNK> , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! 12.145337068332305
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 24.749530788153812
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . 13.59597095018328
" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . 11.828413208696164
Mr . Darcy may <UNK> himself . " " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried Elizabeth . 7.434368176381066
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 11.155855209259443
What will you think of my vanity ? 8.56053725006405
It is admirable ! " Elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 19.437709692365786
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . 10.181294218159449
In a <UNK> voice Mrs . 11.735446905047883
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 14.762339725787408
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs . 7.473544549346639
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . 8.529375465266913
But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . 19.209590927396857
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . 14.58640739839695
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one <UNK> in it an object of compassion , while they are <UNK> of our intimacy at Rosings . " <UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> . 23.001562827720253
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them . " This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret . 15.28992655517893
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 18.33793602336074
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . 10.771558356373154
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . 6.779407677504778
What a fine thing for our girls ! " " How so ? 11.602633507368697
Good gracious ! 10.931790335156341
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . 12.078785888601224
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . 12.523504735499325
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and <UNK> to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head . 12.924918801172627
Elizabeth immediately <UNK> the livery , guessed what it meant , and <UNK> no small degree of surprise to her relations , by <UNK> them with the honour which she expected . 21.114209733849574
CHAPTER XI . 6.932646313148128
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . 16.334205655510626
Every thing that is charming ! 9.87575070168878
My father bears it better . 10.169710686714716
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 23.074433994205908
" My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . " They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . " " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence . " " You cannot be too much on your guard . 17.680323834746574
Long will do any such thing . 7.985567507943463
Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . 9.158020922704656
CHAPTER XV . 6.932646313148128
I shall like it of all things . 5.703175046008752
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 9.679193830705488
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . 11.208032640815679
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! 13.107785662057882
She <UNK> from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . 17.54093840062742
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . 17.322456227487415
On entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . 20.615275952246005
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . " " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . 15.481205796304085
" Kitty and I are going <UNK> to sit in my dressing room . " Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room . 15.656698785541971
<UNK> that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . 10.346515595784126
<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 11.264311073728718
Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 17.16736643308289
I cannot do justice to his kindness . 7.144058105805466
Mary was obliged to <UNK> more with the world , but she could still <UNK> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <UNK> between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <UNK> to the change without much <UNK> . 21.337676423039817
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 15.51469665913109
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 16.881427011713217
I always had a value for him . 5.474543264517715
She answered him with cold civility . 9.578933925905242
She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . 13.016323737507985
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . 14.11803260502794
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent <UNK> of <UNK> on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . 19.021644792829083
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . 10.560834811701548
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . 3.8860759729541274
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of <UNK> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . 18.20611707705052
My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . 12.221428826469944
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <UNK> by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . 18.463891402712065
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she <UNK> in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . 19.87218800904597
The Foundation makes no <UNK> concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States . 38.37675189823552
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 11.090931994683265
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . 14.628537116723018
" I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could . 6.122405244134174
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge . 16.122693930242505
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . 7.833819549357176
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many <UNK> of that nature . 22.053487785661815
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . 14.161231472549506
" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam . 17.70004110129736
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . 16.455979438468226
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 22.39835619034785
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . 10.029582808326202
Society has claims on us all ; and I <UNK> myself one of those who consider intervals of <UNK> and amusement as desirable for every body . " Elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak <UNK> to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from <UNK> a <UNK> either from the <UNK> , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by <UNK> to dance . 22.307439436426254
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . " " To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . " " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . " " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . 15.759178262010312
They were ignorant , idle , and vain . 7.738813324730789
" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! " said she . 6.884664384970307
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . " " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the <UNK> manner which I see so many women ' s do . 17.223717017743322
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of <UNK> to others . 15.901687240035399
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a <UNK> , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . " " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . 17.209920640862205
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 14.713975955174218
" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . 7.4818523163956945
" But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing . 8.503704461666318
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . 22.491479623783135
Do not let us quarrel about the past . 14.964301721748308
<UNK> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 16.000901970326204
" I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the <UNK> and public places . 17.644277591355827
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 20.277640546377786
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
We now come to the point . 6.209700632222353
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings . 16.07963370276538
Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Mr . Collins began . 8.718040064362963
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . 13.513110991617685
Many small donations to , are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the <UNK> . 37.7940320954025
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance <UNK> , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . 20.675488926932058
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very <UNK> reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to <UNK> and <UNK> to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 17.936537263557177
I do not know who is good enough for him . " Mr . and Mrs . 5.2037440788743625
These recollections will not do at all . 9.207395707258748
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . " " She is a very fine looking woman ! 8.098239024862153
At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . " With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 21.530411822125057
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there . 24.401199971017697
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . 13.738369169593813
She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece . 18.890162490745208
CHAPTER V . 6.932646532395619
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company . 8.90982141738038
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . " " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . 12.522686336240163
" But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . " " <UNK> , headstrong girl ! 14.020439125451526
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s . 5.612346551890291
" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 8.670570247385646
Oh , Lord ! 6.103786240841936
Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 11.45202509870089
Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her . 10.27644796637009
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . " The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they <UNK> satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had <UNK> Mrs . 16.232376670221488
dear me ! 4.510658081394559
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely . 10.250474021446193

there is not a bit of fish to be got to day . 8.799478145659394
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . 12.145268326730022
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <UNK> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 15.66069109012698
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you . 10.273342937265323
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <UNK> infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . 23.29015541525168
Not handsome enough to dance with ! 11.123482802750999
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam . 16.839436567408328
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . 10.013741538895975
This was agreed to , and Mrs . 4.255783081806894
This cannot be ! engaged to Mr . Darcy ! 7.288406621715235
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! 11.397365009388542
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 8.026490596223637
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , glancing at her sister and Bingley , shall take place . 15.676577183820715
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . 15.058282025418707
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . 8.608556047836109
One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! 8.587567590548556
He was on one side of her mother . 5.516104177207277
Lizzy <UNK> she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . " " And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems an hopeless business . " " <UNK> to Lizzy about it yourself . 12.100069594668962
Every kind of pride must <UNK> from the connection . 15.696515455743974
They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . 12.078936542036796
What do I not owe you ! 8.260743861598813
She had even learnt to <UNK> , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a <UNK> to disgust and weary . 18.299996232695197
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . 11.386033519776142
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 8.215992285808683
We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . 16.76266319956994
Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 8.925389042223436
" I never heard any thing so abominable . 8.059480174579436
" <UNK> <UNK> . " CHAPTER XIII . 15.287510869515561
Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 8.96756602783822
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . 19.795500301315123
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 12.78445243302325
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . 12.986504844255807
Society , I own , is necessary to me . 5.577527110491545
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library . " Mrs . 22.88455473018715
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . 10.23502530145446
But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . 11.23560306275254
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 9.978684520732962
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <UNK> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <UNK> , and paid off every <UNK> of civility to Elizabeth . 21.846167779332532
" They will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . 11.986773543660028
Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . 6.289442944094034
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 19.269303789936004
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 10.03421679788825
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <UNK> <UNK> better than <UNK> ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 21.92405980309626

Lydia <UNK> as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very <UNK> solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips <UNK> of turning away <UNK> , and if he does , Colonel Forster will <UNK> him . 22.04498117888308
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 16.78173342689148
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the <UNK> , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <UNK> . 16.676020423954217
I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . 12.148498130306201
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . 13.578848041990483
But Georgiana would not join her . 7.320030086405511
Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age . 15.04814855509084
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very <UNK> in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . 16.236144042054693
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 18.188766129056887
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . 15.609667615795308
What did Colonel Forster say ? 12.904437711567656
I have by no means done . 5.591975134772552
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? 17.519139238808076
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . 20.031490421332407
Forster , the delight of Mrs . 4.269387886843954
He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . 16.105439317594705
" Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair . 4.996387092045611
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . 12.684197583441653
who could have done less for her ? 7.334677592659552
We have not met since the th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . " Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when <UNK> to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn . 16.91978718079272
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . 14.913618258675902
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 15.587980019889331
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a <UNK> as this . 16.390391899307843
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . 13.42380335911614
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . 10.743765158009113

They <UNK> their wretchedness , however , by <UNK> after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . 25.4640868212041
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 17.447558447599622
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the <UNK> of his confidence in his friend . 16.759803701839708
" You may well warn me against such an evil . 13.99849317406078
That such a consequence as this should <UNK> , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . " " When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . " " Not the slightest . 13.787858371713968
<UNK> will be absolutely <UNK> , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . 20.37155533764764
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 15.794057380663778
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring . 4.663431742309697
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 15.12555742931588
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . 17.055441036180408
<UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . " " We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . " " But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs . 12.173373287388028

CHAPTER <UNK> . 8.450991212750662
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . 14.760405835168836
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . " " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . 8.627765060048805
" DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations . 11.902570991295521
When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . 10.12809722857263
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half expectation which Mrs . 15.435606537743126
That tall , proud man . " " Good gracious ! 13.409140292060945
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . 7.805875210237017
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . 15.054315887583819
Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . " CHAPTER XIII . 15.53952344737742
has she any family ? " " She has one only daughter , the <UNK> of Rosings , and of very extensive property . " " Ah ! " cried Mrs . 10.955486243027114
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 20.100868708044487
You <UNK> me for coming ? " " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you . 16.296190849312012
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , <UNK> had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 13.788001147993368
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 22.13821097284689
how unlucky ! 7.52234132968309
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . 16.721939925166534
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 17.83638474376065
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . 11.87477176453437
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her <UNK> spirits , and of teaching her that her present <UNK> are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 13.777825830354802
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 13.757175059267421
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an <UNK> man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a <UNK> , had nothing to say to her . 14.169187684154158
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . 10.918640768095974

He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily <UNK> seeing him , till after the departure of the former . 18.618438423934734
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ? 9.241816769240128
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <UNK> . 19.537204209822377
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was <UNK> for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . 20.501778520429948
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 3.778525691647375
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 9.161007582740034
Her ease and good spirits increased . 12.23915888760964
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . 8.025634024270508
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . 16.461446396346474
Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 12.771234580330804
" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . " " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . " Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . 16.28527195337052
Though Lydia ' s short letter to Mrs . 8.977573082531832
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 16.331801036207803
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? " " One of them does . " " Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . 20.307855464649375

At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction . 15.88438799298849
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 15.301554465611801
what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . 11.714733288803094
My temper I dare not vouch for . It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world . 17.157962292171014
<UNK> sons cannot marry where they like . " " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . " " Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . " " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl ' s younger son ? 20.015009027665037
I . 1.5341129384436574
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you . 10.719061323916101
" You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . 5.586640964452281
" I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . 9.385852711741249
I quite detest the man . " CHAPTER IV . 9.601323885740195
<UNK> away the letter immediately and <UNK> a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . " " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . 12.443665786531646
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle . 9.10814895033838
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . 8.54332364077173
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . 14.432914411467696
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W . 26.36842172098452
" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be <UNK> , for <UNK> I must call it . " " It is wonderful , " replied Wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 15.070022370598151
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 14.4652821808508
An union of a different tendency , and <UNK> the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . 12.837615175174218
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 18.023265162310036
What will Wickham say ? 8.076936868974014
" Oh ! 3.580881536246356
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 18.827540304736544
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing . 19.04921697105367
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs . 12.672494277039837
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . 16.433472299361924
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . 15.942003950751857
and what can he have to say ? " " Something very much to the purpose of course . 7.675676492087327
She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent . 9.852873672763554
The housekeeper came ; a respectable looking , <UNK> woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . 15.800606079027233
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 25.20194064066494
Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . 14.33768421490416
Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed . 12.970944251319034
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . 21.810013544510408
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . 19.890004756341405

As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . " " Oh ! 12.070507108217368
GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 21.554049876719773
" Yours , c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a <UNK> fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . " " Oh ! 11.48138100102138
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . 11.615279304573365
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . 8.64099092239578
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 32.527109356723884
sir , I do indeed . 5.096807752896783
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it <UNK> . 13.912394674954653
my sweetest Lizzy ! 9.659614757259313
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . 8.985960202618866
I am prodigiously proud of him . 7.218945371693931
But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! 8.955568178974355
and it was not wholly without foundation . 6.931908730981086
He is perfectly amiable . 6.66748597697483
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
<UNK> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all . 12.412291623252248
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . 5.359105423614295
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . " " What should not you mind ? " " I should not mind any thing at all . " " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . " " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail . 10.771806870543443
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . " " You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . 12.991037972386904
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished <UNK> of integrity or benevolence , that might <UNK> him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the <UNK> of virtue , atone for those <UNK> errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . 28.019958273687458
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 26.01532454964674
This is my advice . 6.249779539652191
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . 20.628722300870173
Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him . 9.080369530174268
If a woman <UNK> her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . 17.319367086680955
I hate such false friends . 10.265087273413386
Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <UNK> at whist , enumerating all the <UNK> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he <UNK> his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . 25.868268351446513
My aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . " " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . 12.514764305900101
I wish you had been there . 4.36512526979175
What are we to do ! " would they often <UNK> in the bitterness of <UNK> . 14.694784890857264
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? 16.369176421312005
" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . 7.8863320218939394
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 17.198597973688674
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs . 9.73953957391346
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 13.010997760222168
Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody ' s reserve , can be answerable for the event . 17.36532443880233
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> . 13.96206969535067
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <UNK> ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 20.65715280692635
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew . 7.282440270041362
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence . 15.592946851673
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> ! 16.724641651545802
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else ! 8.684586925326787
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . 10.409335959410583
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . 17.686129611693836
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 14.213827682333882
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . 14.636155703736343
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , <UNK> , absurd . 20.262782934516597
What could your ladyship propose by it ? " " At once to insist upon having such a report universally <UNK> . " " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . " " If ! 14.223625313892393
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . 16.407309433552285
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <UNK> satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 24.63655751928332
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on . 19.199873510319648
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 25.39797361529593
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 16.10119885880705
But here , by carrying with me one <UNK> source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <UNK> . 21.090129261023904
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , <UNK> from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and <UNK> by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 20.762456549880532
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . 7.6049761767034125
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . 9.578829855812067
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . " " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " And how impossible in others ! " " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? " " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . 15.442515480653295
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 16.96231335917187
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? 24.305060588504045
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . 21.30378497945513
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 19.32769253407413
Any other inconsistencies with modern <UNK> have been left as printed . 34.64197938362099
But if I go on , I shall <UNK> you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . 12.895289019841998
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 20.810619100588912
This was very amiable , but Charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . 17.62167185069164
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 4.527146892109621
<UNK> them next to your great uncle the judge . 13.31407751794043
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <UNK> by the possessor , and often without any attention to the <UNK> of the performance . 19.13396023199816
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . " Elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . 14.093075832221105
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 10.045341993400978
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . 11.303263888199272
He has children of his own , and may have more . 6.1124808076724095
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 13.754969464769836
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character . 14.641964211895797
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . 9.425103798717533
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia . 13.755277493186425
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 15.37447695023772
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . 10.071611910921447
She has a very good notion of <UNK> , though her taste is not equal to Anne ' s . 14.084749833581498
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night . 14.467980093662417
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 9.984267709828309
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever . 13.746870617535098
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 12.657687412539138
Mr . Collins received and returned these <UNK> with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <UNK> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 24.11297516187934
" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . 13.792361462531897
But think no more of the letter . 4.889838874298342
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 20.642882773215177
" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . " " Is my father in town ? " " Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . " " And have you heard from him often ? " " We have heard only once . 11.817020109272413
" What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut . 7.989512200540594
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 20.95944193655952
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . 14.931190142032792
Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . 11.231519385349905
What are men to <UNK> and mountains ? 18.111763536449654
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . 20.39582399812656
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 17.531656281741473
She had been <UNK> pleased to approve of both the <UNK> , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . 15.461408457253837
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in <UNK> affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? 17.3599651268278
To no creature had it been revealed , where <UNK> was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 17.711165515402428
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 10.695296572834073
She opened the door , and met Maria in the <UNK> place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza ! 14.707686320900477
His disposition must be dreadful . " " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . " Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from <UNK> , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! " " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; <UNK> of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same <UNK> care . 16.846636673200443
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 10.998077277258519
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . 8.785146450831494
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of <UNK> . " He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . 13.585513542558175
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . 15.272589365525034
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . 13.428751352457104
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . 12.667174060428232
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 19.761711393709906
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . 11.088764440881818
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . 14.060175857770513
They may be <UNK> and printed and given away you may do <UNK> <UNK> with public domain eBooks . 39.70556658019872
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was . 14.086712751609769
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at Longbourn . 19.768003528308334
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some <UNK> , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . " When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister . 19.15860331560818
You refuse to <UNK> the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . 12.686148608900032
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 15.55758327637103
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . " " If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . 14.96392149587612
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . 19.06439931771807
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . 12.350346917494004
When is your turn to come ? 8.770437854059557
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 18.384525559571998
The letter was to this effect " MY DEAR <UNK> , " I wish you joy . 14.791637256713006
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . 12.635397326465684
Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father . 15.526380799589871
I know you will contrive it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . 12.89744924880036
Let me hear from you very soon . 7.9488362428938215
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! 11.465222516851581

Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . 10.106420459953705
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . " " I see no occasion for that . 9.785196873530396
Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . 3.808952252453522
Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 12.752596000677618
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My <UNK> were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte . 15.083496597008853
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 8.444271354166876
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . 11.21849572405777
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 15.715319402529826
CHAPTER II . 6.715135170230704
Let me do it without farther loss of time . 11.01115769381674
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . 14.755972390068424
He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father ' s intentions . 17.868212902631456
Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very <UNK> said , " What is the matter mamma ? 12.684070842389875
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . 16.71359030802464
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <UNK> of a bad day . 15.83187228753129
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . 10.789729589187667
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being <UNK> by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . 21.16710123325184
" How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! 7.801331606440385
Has it not been <UNK> <UNK> by yourselves ? 31.625443338487305
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 10.929499145128029
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 14.293516782229652
" A man who has once been refused ! 14.003044254277086
Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . 16.489580918541254
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . 15.099459257543069
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . 21.476025643281748
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <UNK> her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 17.314548762640975
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . 13.775494221327383
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <UNK> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . 18.448379720505702
While these <UNK> born notions were passing in their <UNK> , the perturbation of Elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . 31.666353229717462
The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 12.238241283205316
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 12.909837745389515
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ' s <UNK> , and complimented her on bearing it so well . 18.792270346235707
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile it was decided . 14.294974384646805
I never was . 2.5198308761405754
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be <UNK> into it ? " " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to <UNK> with rather more <UNK> the degree of importance which is to <UNK> to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . 20.642839329782724
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that <UNK> is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . 15.294143809794864
Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not <UNK> . 14.680981172600585

No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . 13.876378571050457
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . 31.056087443099067
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . 16.664030229923764
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 8.72627521037342
Do not distress me by the idea . 7.874594512629591
Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active <UNK> , and when immediately before my father ' s death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . " " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth . 14.70589988554767
Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 16.399103004203024
I thought we never should have got into the coach . 10.776909110547853
<UNK> spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother in law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . 19.815904517415607
I do think Mrs . 3.8707381044405733
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly <UNK> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . 20.84742424918114
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy . 11.332631200657765
A little time therefore . I shall certainly try to get the better . " With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . " " My dear Jane ! " exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good . 13.957988786004279
Gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . 17.229607551411043
You see on what a footing we are . 9.618710845639136
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most <UNK> in inviting Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 17.203022719783814
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . 11.212582554874182
Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . " " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget . 17.645246397442342
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 20.41959144133007
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater <UNK> than first <UNK> often boast ; and so <UNK> did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were <UNK> to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 20.75613960147541
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . 9.846293528579531
How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . 11.17435794986317
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . 14.109045456818471
Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ? 19.072167527012827

It was to be such a secret ! " " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject . 7.609350658471756
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 19.54854633936027
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . 11.588116443402189

Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give <UNK> confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr . Darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr .

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <UNK> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . 13.386981908555551
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane . 7.222551265722344
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her . 13.198493625812981
" For my own part , " she <UNK> , " I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . 9.742695249831494
The children have been wanting me this half hour . 14.10847213528835
Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces . 11.458203285418257
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . 9.387720671117517
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 17.904208165752376
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not . 12.380520696897959
how shall I bear so much happiness ! " She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty . 18.616054883127795
About the <UNK> , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . " Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings . 20.172211005685984
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . " As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the <UNK> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . 14.732593167975775
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . " " Very true ; and if I had my will , we should . 9.003907520710815
By this time she is actually with them ! 10.872999632812105
The second began . 6.404760995214004
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . 11.473024604129002
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 8.392651685379198
I had no notion but he would go a <UNK> , or something or other , and not <UNK> us with his company . 13.533623224408805
If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go . 9.21256376109375
A most delightful place ! <UNK> Parsonage House ! 38.22432121043645
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so <UNK> ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . 16.416758466802428
In a few minutes , Mrs . 5.888888760404422
" They are going to be <UNK> near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! 17.423216983933177
what hours of <UNK> we shall spend ! 19.00431498620079
You must not suspect me . 7.037565886535987
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . " " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth . 13.561573697150912
Collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . 16.232671625512396
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr . Darcy . She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! Yet it did , and even a third . 23.97715476998314
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 20.86133435533332
<UNK> requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much <UNK> and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements . 35.5182475583504
You must therefore allow me to follow the <UNK> of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . 19.21092504597472
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have <UNK> either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . 18.329823982056382
Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 9.424858555164414
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well . 11.9937843248416
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that . 11.356845328574346
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . 11.135737926559711
Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 14.46007223032084

Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . 17.391607765679336
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 16.437320754368262
" Not at all . 3.8284987245435897
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 18.22498777754048
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 4.879563648400341
At length however Mrs . 8.065914940823516
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . 12.611618242019151
Catherine , weak <UNK> , irritable , and completely under Lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self <UNK> and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . 24.065299288365726
Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . 14.39604178751384
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . 10.88377519999228
To Mr . and Mrs . 3.379400941195766
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 13.85148765333776
They must be a great loss to your family . " In Darcy ' s presence she dared not mention Wickham ' s name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <UNK> in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , <UNK> herself <UNK> to <UNK> the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . 27.392797008677753
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 6.7467269493697835

<UNK> on Jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy ' s explanation , by <UNK> Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 16.654510749136193
CHAPTER IV . 6.932646694476038
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole <UNK> of <UNK> , as was here collected in one individual . 29.720101625096724
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled . " A gentleman and a stranger ! 12.580611221501073
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 15.833694826777801
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word . 12.737270825720504
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . 15.12644424051166
CHAPTER I . 2.8380368561768754
" Your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . 13.671145654916142
How is such a man to be worked on ? 8.911903762768027
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat <UNK> attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must <UNK> every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <UNK> . 23.706379358757864
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . 25.36097471103881
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . 10.320074558369315
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs . 7.809395749599949
If he had been <UNK> before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity <UNK> could make him . 16.59261102797326
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North . 11.414877832241
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . 11.479058161433786
Why must their marriage be private ? 13.250305695869857
You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg tm works . 22.39444670411611
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B . 16.721802916649757
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . 16.218760292034176
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . 8.377570937155516
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <UNK> to her <UNK> , afforded no <UNK> of her distress . 29.74919103816934
What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! 11.932161461003204
A clergyman like you must marry . <UNK> properly , chuse a <UNK> for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . 22.573222338721806
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse . 20.62271425059284
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 8.711011625879063
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . 13.816493224929744
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . 13.935104485479055
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 15.79091073018767
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <UNK> society . " " But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . " " Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . 15.129522945677868
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . 16.66240444794831
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 11.204617995967727
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . 9.957855597541187
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . 13.741588807643769
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . 20.594101077508725
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . 17.743648127040444
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . The possibility of his having really endured such <UNK> , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained . 16.49433870188186
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . 12.524225044936514
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . 9.546601561227991
" <UNK> Oh ! 9.242493552096713
From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 21.781480354973148
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to <UNK> people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? 15.184424530820555
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . 25.215999684044792
But I must tell you how it went off . 8.52522606897758
Till this moment , I never knew myself . " From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . 12.976910700818767
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . 13.793057795071958
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty <UNK> , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . 28.130957282469257
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s <UNK> name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father ' s estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think . 17.689548357727375
CHAPTER XVI . 6.932646313148128
My feelings will not be repressed . 8.668920235136744
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 5.809675431959235
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . " Elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! 16.588003011729814
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 12.499644817946738
yes . 3.3543080771719596
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . " Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . 22.963688193012196
The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . 15.861233573825354
We must have Mrs . 4.921168822358042
" Are you not diverted ? " " Oh ! 8.489221293356827
On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . 13.900145892885067
Your <UNK> makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a <UNK> . " " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! 23.03611139056343
" You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried . 6.575740743348905
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 10.347515905875719
They came . 4.0045817421134755
" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister . 8.508337590800881
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " " <UNK> do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 19.655938137412797
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford <UNK> , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 21.619377768385483
What relates to yourself , is as follows . 9.369047975724012
Every <UNK> <UNK> in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther <UNK> of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago <UNK> his <UNK> in the affair ; that proud and <UNK> as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had <UNK> brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be <UNK> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <UNK> or <UNK> habits . 25.23266340786476
Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . 8.088258044260774
" A <UNK> ! " she cried . 8.05561112578517
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . 17.37348292804729
" <UNK> he will not leave London before he has found them . 12.432818145186301
" You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . 13.317104008502755
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . 18.27549867908944
Consider Mr . Collins ' s respectability , and Charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . 13.12897619067954
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish . 20.18931711116224
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time . 8.185868026363526
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . 10.73636106147297
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 12.722160250980089
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . <UNK> staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . 20.461749192622285
I shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will <UNK> and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " Elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 17.333697656801085
Every thing <UNK> what is strong already . 20.17104744901006
Nothing could be more delightful ! 10.35918773824394
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . 14.134540594951632
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s <UNK> . 14.795485478879348
They are gone off together from Brighton . 13.034693329261726
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . " " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal <UNK> of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first <UNK> for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . 16.321394058825888
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? 15.999807445899355
Lakes , mountains , and <UNK> , shall not be <UNK> together in our <UNK> ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . 33.60015459643709
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . 10.79074132192588
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 12.153166508419117
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 22.374025499279956
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 10.353606768917588
But it is of small importance . " " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and <UNK> me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? 14.517152135929404
You never see a fault in any body . 9.46140298709724
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the <UNK> of red <UNK> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 21.222368739279137
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . 11.976909086058033

Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . 9.275393630263407
Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar . 14.454532747404441
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 23.234154318867756
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 15.057100834956778
They contained no actual <UNK> , nor was there any <UNK> of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 32.67002130388476
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 27.17025573668945
Very nonsensical to come at all ! 11.693100265477726
Kitty , run down and order the carriage . 9.691662012281572
I rather wonder now at your knowing any . " " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " I never saw such a woman . 13.042510907135002
She saw herself the object of attention , to <UNK> and to <UNK> of them at present unknown . 12.966339363460492
<UNK> and <UNK> I can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart . 29.55392394212669
Three daughters married ! 13.976499409575014
She certainly did not hate him . 8.006203108257893
" Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . 6.103635204246222
Bennet was <UNK> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and <UNK> in her <UNK> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the <UNK> happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 20.01898626221732
was not a man to be trusted . 4.6537486790168066
If I were not afraid of judging <UNK> , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . 14.776171996172803
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 12.065030188980797
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of <UNK> in that way . 14.813727430086338
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . 14.680323729979378
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 21.258390932431332
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . 19.179651230179132
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . " " I would wish not to be hasty in <UNK> any one ; but I always speak what I think . " " I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder . 11.012109970550961
" While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr . Bingley . " " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife . 9.28626507684754
But I will not repine . 5.664156230549247
Such a countenance , such manners ! 9.101933850927354
Bennet was most <UNK> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 15.89414959052018
The first part of Mrs . 5.362856860877578
He leaves out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <UNK> . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must <UNK> reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility . 17.7118618896439
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . 17.668712613162857
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child . 15.733351925083731
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity . 23.105409969521418
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 12.683040920721883
Every thing , however , went on <UNK> , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ' s first sketch . 17.345762859659544
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . 10.846587970163384
Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . 9.942382980992692
<UNK> , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . 11.54249265285058
A regard for the <UNK> would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . 22.885510368838958
No sentiment of shame gave a <UNK> to her triumph . 17.791912750386697
Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn . 11.276239154063466
Bennet , was not so well pleased with it . 4.78591217706757
Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the <UNK> and smiles of the whole party . 16.23442481771304
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . 25.892307366906493
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . 9.341883770749972
Darcy may be guessed . 6.558601260561216
Give me farther particulars . 12.849275898564775
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 17.75062068499346
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . 15.563947581009021
But I have other <UNK> . 7.457716903261029
As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it <UNK> and lovely as ever . 17.049077244930814
But Mrs . 2.9020612508168098
What congratulations will then flow in ! 15.239120863972053
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? " " Oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all . 9.361029039093527
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 16.915344530907067
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . 8.237427128179773
Yet he is such a man ! " " Yes , yes , they must marry . 8.400555168617016
He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . 12.657999176631769
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much <UNK> ; but when Mrs . 19.89425234424907
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house . 10.29254923922537
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did . 11.896302569011718
Mr . what ' s his name . 4.533022218616855
Mr . Bennet accepted the <UNK> , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . 21.332164651255447
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 22.2749768606757
Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at <UNK> , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs . 19.768350470814774
They walked on , without knowing in what direction . 10.022713592358528
They all <UNK> tables , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> . 52.34841573011816
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . 13.387006232079756
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent . 10.156858438589596
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . 12.294313054390704
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 16.31681168040605
They will take care not to <UNK> their income . 15.320495754533265
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 10.568553120601356
Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority . 18.619515732675975
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , <UNK> every chance of <UNK> himself by marrying well ? 22.633229493044738
Bennet could hardly comprehend it . 7.107955234427577
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 18.36997249124218
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . 23.134923274069653
<UNK> such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not <UNK> the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . 14.017588205867623
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 14.921649090274395
Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . 12.325977959193269
Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs . 9.461793321214643
Make haste , make haste . 12.969505614028597
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 16.035714917754415
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 13.081933519285416
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . 10.011223832861623
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . " Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . 11.94497760593549
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W . 18.008280185506568
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . " She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . 18.041885126849888
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . 16.309691258020973
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . 9.315694860442274
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 15.002848470670092
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . 12.499685754485983
But so they always are . 5.308855477810399
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . 11.507579705523302
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . 8.882064452697303
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 14.217071770070696
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . " " This is not to be borne . 9.892296995569351
Poor Lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . 11.560465755433802
Good girl ! 8.865776142307011
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . 12.568985988402664
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . 14.579851888762514
A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . 21.454588939145985
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 13.552797443627531
A house in town ! 8.257623741687574
<UNK> to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . 14.354365752652344
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy ' s regard . " " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? " " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . " " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy . 11.511409640052545
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 12.229210305811304
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months . 23.756200155989845
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 18.959457003011565
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . 14.041047425213895
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . 9.790679605552231
Mr . Bennet protested against any description of finery . 13.327812345560892
She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa . 11.144934141484253
" He seems to be a most <UNK> and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so <UNK> as to let him come to us again . " " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . " " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . " Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of <UNK> , marrying , and <UNK> his <UNK> whenever it were required . 19.617611238193902
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 12.928393012594633
Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? 17.06322494285827
Her mind was less difficult to <UNK> . 14.523128665627144
Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical . 16.27487468535099
. 1.3085768265604334
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . 25.28072450933794

I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 10.855090704293096
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . 17.738551181564894
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . 11.37172780057431
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs . 7.3021765718027325
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 9.73944944558433
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . " " Oh ! 11.528247241921159
" Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . 10.318115202508281
CHAPTER II . 6.715135170230704
" Not yet , " replied Jane . 5.250478341235734
Well , much good may it do them ! 7.764253287481318
It adds even another motive . 15.456825547096807
Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . " " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . " " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " I honour your circumspection . 10.235878538701341
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 16.744104336083517
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned . 18.373326707820016
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . 12.868094745337936
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> . 27.97109828874038
But let me advise you to think better of it . 8.035468703435365
He <UNK> , and <UNK> , and makes love to us all . 11.250572622657142
They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <UNK> <UNK> and head <UNK> there is not much the matter with me . 23.48159116655561
Believe her to be deceived by all means . 8.606766884751291
So near a <UNK> to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart . 18.663666716368425
Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . " " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . 12.063415851940997
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> . 29.290762212778198
It cannot be concealed from any one . 8.708139664791272
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . 15.38085865131732
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were <UNK> in her favour . 14.228972653131379
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 17.841950484591983
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . " " I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a kingdom ! 10.058670308136795
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . 16.706359559773336
. F . . Some states do not allow <UNK> of certain implied <UNK> or the exclusion or limitation of certain <UNK> of damages . 40.57169288971914
Let me mend it for you . 7.442995886072064
You are not going to be <UNK> , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . 13.590160066742538
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! 15.996903864901679
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 21.452792229127233
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . 9.706738523076593
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 17.13177648686727
Now what have you to say ? " " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . " Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . 12.29445914353684
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . 12.962414702746383
The extravagance and general <UNK> which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 18.074891309443924
In the former were many good <UNK> ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some <UNK> of Miss Darcy ' s , in <UNK> , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . 23.5188439181132
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> . 25.866298015399902
She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . 21.379572968238932
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . 17.15025305001426
Mr . Collins was carefully <UNK> them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <UNK> them . 16.53270863779169
" When my eyes were opened to his real character . Oh ! 11.59973088786671
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . 14.746919337364371
No , no , you shall not deceive me . 6.173599133653165
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Had his character been known , this could not have happened . 9.08758747089164
By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <UNK> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 20.983573235028388
A thousand things may arise in six months ! " The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . 25.949651486868202
Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the <UNK> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . 20.01483906924652
Her answer was warmly in his favour . 9.674098863283273
it is just as he <UNK> . 7.568287156747892
On finding Mrs . 7.268157164662132
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . 12.803888716361518
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 11.991740220062889
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . 17.774807299104673
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 15.16274745707887
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . 13.748609303415265
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged . 12.90112747703967
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 16.009977065375733
Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> . 14.906481443109888
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . 9.84972484997175
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go . 5.917571618041056
To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough . 11.30690954963111
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 16.48611459160723
Bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . 14.212331981385798
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she <UNK> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . 20.17148180512578
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 9.592921456976775
She blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . 12.253200291504815
After a slight <UNK> for good news , the letter was read aloud . 16.581020446695767
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . 13.676021100246931
The <UNK> <UNK> of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in <UNK> with her opinion of each . 19.839795545976955
Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and <UNK> its extent . 24.290923977622693
But don ' t imagine it was from any silly cause . 17.731762478729934
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified . 11.977187794948788
" ' Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much . 8.510997036677582
Heaven forbid ! 12.598380546779099
It is what every body says . 8.730039327858524
It was all pride and <UNK> . 8.11417089455457
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . 7.28750415883885
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 9.511067253927802
Never mind Miss Lizzy ' s hair . " " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . " " Oh ! 16.8823304024688
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to <UNK> the fruits of her own <UNK> offence . 21.88726357763226
" Let us sit down . 9.197751313291736
" What do you think ? 5.833916271086211
That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <UNK> in town , as Mr . Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . 16.503523650233678
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 19.848328676024632
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 16.054814224251082
Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 12.198816217118953
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 22.02229766421221
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . 7.761671161562177
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 13.807285354930162
And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from <UNK> . 10.844645555515758
She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most <UNK> by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . 12.993058356757025
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation . 17.161363249248122
She often tried to provoke Darcy into <UNK> her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . 22.442610601375634
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . 17.570776364908003
The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs . 8.349015358384072
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s foot <UNK> , that she said , ' Mr . Collins , you must marry . 14.8359514457907
" <UNK> . 4.740297600479707
We passed each other several times . 15.963428511203501
<UNK> , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . 15.974466208991231
" I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she . 5.7728825262574315
This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better . 12.713463633517335
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . 11.842809840737823
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . 10.548465735732416
The Foundation is <UNK> to complying with the laws <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> donations in all states of the United States . 40.66108449288867
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 15.576784025636114
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a <UNK> library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read <UNK> . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose <UNK> ' s <UNK> . 26.896467382030806
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . 21.439984157490706
Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> . 9.60113470763182
CHAPTER VI . 6.932646532395619
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . " Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs . 8.612284171970416
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . 15.193541667135644
Thank Heaven ! 12.007129726157435
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman <UNK> the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . 12.798836833048275
" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! 7.957354054299092
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . 14.699747428218181
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 15.103998931815259
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of <UNK> whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to <UNK> , she began to regret that he came . 16.20595531837107
There can be no love in all this . 6.79455300108928
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . 23.843305336231165
To Caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit . 16.585488931041144
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 15.47620621992626
The party did not supply much conversation . 11.059078678772735
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair . 16.439554867638375
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . 7.667693532976195
Gardiner . 2.565121365794866
She does not yet leave her dressing room . 11.279305465842569
Well , well , I only hope it will last . 6.0225495566756635
Bennet ' s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . 10.60765196386454
Yours ever , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " With the officers ! " cried Lydia . 13.687803603634517
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . 13.775226324842915
All Meryton seemed striving to <UNK> the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . 19.406258488585422
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <UNK> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . 18.466257292070694
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 17.061010318071965
No , no I feel he may defy us there . 10.26528195998782
But she is perfectly amiable , and often <UNK> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . " " Has she been presented ? 22.420787817309836
Bennet thus began the <UNK> conversation . " Oh ! 13.515027466547368
Mr . Darcy ! and so it does I <UNK> . 6.689278876269604
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <UNK> , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 16.37282025953301
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 19.760077046723783
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . 15.470391648771662
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . 17.744361492009457
Collins ' s <UNK> of meat were too large for her family . 14.448831376931484
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . " Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire . 15.750380194538453
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . 12.821644130520129
Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night <UNK> and <UNK> gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty <UNK> away . " " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " " You go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds ! 19.330311332312817
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , <UNK> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 19.38373126376469
I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . " Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . 12.723343998708307
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . 9.182165333574892
" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party . 8.21310859168541
Are you going much farther ? " " No , I should have turned in a moment . " And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together . 13.528781036822782
Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 19.157815887481757
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . 24.95709042745665
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . 12.623757735810344
I was never more <UNK> ! 8.957033231438198
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " " That you certainly shall . " " And I have another favour to ask . 12.944314046900047
Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a <UNK> over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was <UNK> Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <UNK> . 16.213044964010766
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! 15.47414259632157
But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . 5.372697236099995
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 21.97880978039483
Lord ! 5.738515514804995
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . 14.579155254364327
Mr . Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the <UNK> and go to sleep . 11.266677542613904
He does not want abilities . 9.723898413356451
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . 13.172639602726115
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . 6.598101116904721
I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . 18.92586221122831
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his <UNK> , all honoured with the <UNK> of <UNK> , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . 18.300923108555303
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 13.326644291286431
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . " " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an <UNK> , <UNK> disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will <UNK> the whole room , and be handed down to <UNK> with all the <UNK> of a <UNK> . " " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he . 20.425131180106288
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 9.09737476187741
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . 9.14299188590514
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . 14.280378106053533
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . 10.879405554434602
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 15.84616471027074
In the first place , she persisted in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might be broken off . 15.753015982130059
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . " " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 12.427957709072901
She had got rid of two of the <UNK> which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . 15.519225313331427
But at length , by Elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that <UNK> which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the <UNK> . 16.676614258854148
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 14.109362333713038
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side . 16.667473156887255
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the <UNK> , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening . 16.191673103105646
And then when we came away it was such fun ! 13.748067883597036
I know your disposition , Lizzy . 5.28759069541901
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature . 22.62540787215273
Mr . Darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . 7.680598039024844
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . " From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . 15.299564058217687
Have you had any flirting ? 11.778577799245806
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . 15.667787753028028
I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . 10.926282620347836
In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . 11.577349183494464
Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other . 8.645859911914128
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . 22.89091697074012
Mr . Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . 12.245352378751717
At five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . 26.931553839934363
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply <UNK> on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . 24.909114502375438
Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . 11.918302387812354
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them . 14.076257850687885
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she <UNK> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . " Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . Wickham ' s attentions . 20.56383818113208
Your <UNK> are by no means unlike . 18.97256657261746
Mr . Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . 19.479090773903273
" And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . 8.260683857305825
CHAPTER XV . 6.932646313148128
Your ' s , very sincerely , " <UNK> . 7.9440080906528525
That he was surprised by the <UNK> was evident ; he <UNK> it however with <UNK> , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner . 16.935403620907632
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had <UNK> to his amusement . 17.25748894960934
It is really too distressing . 9.006216095549116
I did not expect such a compliment . " " Did not you ? 7.496337061398407
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , <UNK> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . 16.242968220704675
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr . Darcy . " She then sought her eldest sister , who had <UNK> to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . 14.928410002571475
yes I understand you perfectly . " " I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . " " That is as it happens . 13.102037716530889
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 13.051235468958946
There is a <UNK> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . 13.08353173796046
In such an <UNK> my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I <UNK> upon his goodness . " " Oh ! 17.894777205383694
" Gracechurch street , <UNK> . 10.06668239926301
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 16.278128516521022
" He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived . 7.1570870686522285
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 21.290261885070073
They are my old friends . 8.809762774311581
On Mr . and Mrs . 3.532061633726926
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . 14.698603310390482
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . " " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <UNK> which other people may observe . 22.62380929824523
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . 14.116911739471576
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . 14.61084879561023
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all <UNK> , was still <UNK> <UNK> . 16.40450682058503
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . 17.49591121013828
But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . 16.896296758605423
Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in <UNK> , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and <UNK> a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire . 19.979530492481302
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 11.3548874438331
The adieu is <UNK> itself . 19.222184074324126
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 7.7149459128556375
" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But now we may be silent . " " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " Sometimes . 22.954204107377997
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . 11.697585801860102
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . 16.9609241550231
" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not <UNK> declare that Caroline neither <UNK> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <UNK> the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly ! to put me on my guard ? 22.062282386179955
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 17.967241660335727
If his own vanity , however , did not <UNK> him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . 11.86835329653951
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost . 11.72707441138533
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . " " I am , " said he , with a firm voice . 8.162938491833176
do any thing rather than marry without affection . 12.312748804390933
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 12.97436102606779
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . 12.205416157402086
" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . 11.426024245397553
<UNK> me in silence . 8.82539519317424
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . 7.155879676361722
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Mr . Darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <UNK> throughout the whole . 21.949800997387573
They are all for what they can get . 7.74636759365116
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . 9.517685182352501
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . " Mrs . 11.78104765758168
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . 10.505677919819568
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . 14.254356292698308
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 13.985696322531556
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley . 11.562754711737
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . 11.775743902207017
Elizabeth did all she could , to <UNK> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 15.96367371348318
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . " This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . 16.11878758589433
Have you seen any pleasant men ? 16.485718369800658
Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a <UNK> air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . 27.96132528787507
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . 12.419416916073784
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley ' s behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . 11.395620916062695
I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . 13.98893653887347
" You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age . " " I am not one and twenty . " When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . 13.033737112309577
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? " Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . 12.776148529306317
She had also to <UNK> how her visit would pass , the quiet <UNK> of their usual employments , the vexatious <UNK> of Mr . Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings . 20.37699608490606
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
He is come Mr . Bingley is come . He is , indeed . 6.204465367546465
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . " She was then proceeding to all the particulars of <UNK> , muslin , and <UNK> , and would shortly have <UNK> some very <UNK> orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted . 20.275446200689295
After a short pause , her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me . 13.388451347328074
CHAPTER XII . 6.932646313148128
Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . " After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! 17.876709893585918
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 9.525936353806285
He has more to give . 4.8746002808084095
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
. E . . You may convert to and distribute this work in any <UNK> , <UNK> , marked up , <UNK> or <UNK> form , including any word <UNK> or <UNK> form . 35.73103332067898
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <UNK> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <UNK> . 22.421390283415995
But of course she did not mention my name to you . " " Yes , she did . " " And what did she say ? " " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well . 9.3847933617713
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . 18.301129518321925
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 10.72136160239896
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 13.009360084928797
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should <UNK> an occasion of <UNK> his respect towards any body connected with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared . Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . 21.160271668170417
Bingley and talked of Mrs . 4.071468437600566
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the <UNK> curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two <UNK> of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . The envelope itself was likewise full . <UNK> her way along the lane , she then began it . 26.570000187405142
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 8.487689381113173
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the <UNK> Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . 13.87706685486328
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild <UNK> , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character . 21.18692400800511
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . 13.547632898305379
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and <UNK> mercenary ; and the <UNK> of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to <UNK> at any thing . 24.9994555441743
Her ladyship ' s carriage is <UNK> ordered for us . 19.245876913363922
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 15.05417442626389
but there were two or three much <UNK> in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to <UNK> it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . 23.124546590695985
I have a high respect for your nerves . 9.527212406033593
I will think no more about him . " Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth . 15.41341673117546
Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . " Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . 14.413231258662133
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <UNK> from the marriage of her sisters . 14.298162806066307
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . 16.688108079241278
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . 14.396980501395946
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . 9.90230073969535
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . 9.661445171662502
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time . 12.332662493062857
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the <UNK> property of some one or other of their daughters . 19.54929366650858
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , <UNK> against the <UNK> conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . 29.678894359748313
I enquired after their brother , of course . 7.242544400298965
" It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . 5.96459162922046
It <UNK> me , I confess ; for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . 14.185786520187047
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 17.44787903928398
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . " " My dear , you flatter me . 9.93161033232563
Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton . 8.949473785970678
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs . 5.71345948143713
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . 9.721692625022488
But that is not the case here . 5.408675271313218
She dared not even mention that gentleman . 10.855471850898816
Her mother <UNK> <UNK> , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 23.831986452437672
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 10.859598491268068
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you . 10.655809112907603
" I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel <UNK> ' s regiment went away . 12.370998300509978
" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . " " You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! If my vanity had taken a <UNK> turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <UNK> . " On Miss Lucas ' s <UNK> , however , she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . " And gravely glancing at Mr . Darcy , " There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with ' <UNK> your breath to cool your <UNK> , ' and I shall keep mine to <UNK> my song . " Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . 21.37695759822727
" And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! 7.845662629123146
" If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . 14.662089866306655
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane . 13.96228584968913
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his <UNK> . 22.463678091306942
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . 13.192143898611363
The officers will find women better worth their notice . 20.737229753371384
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " Elizabeth could not but look surprised . 16.569173019936397
Her performance on the piano forte is <UNK> . " " It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . " " All young ladies accomplished ! 15.764874527552921
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been <UNK> by long expectations . 12.169802796111734
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 10.474816434575484
Pemberley was now Georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . 11.03860106315774
Her hair so <UNK> , so <UNK> ! " " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six <UNK> deep in <UNK> , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . " " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . 20.91977150085668
These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 14.801538201026242
Bennet , " I am quite delighted with him . 5.231916059362676
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . 14.249782698941058
He knows where we live . 12.097435662626514
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his <UNK> to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm . 17.414219442141626
He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia . 12.544901800883798
Well , how pleased I am ! 7.439051654718347
" If they had uncles enough to <UNK> all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one <UNK> less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . 17.470005319615414
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected . 11.501798167599564
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley is not he ? 9.545072886622616
As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . 10.66491782809693
Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs . 17.382750198548784
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 9.197829425994133
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission . 9.132216541381139
Besides , it will not much signify what one <UNK> this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . " " Are they indeed ? " cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . 15.325676583019886
The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 16.711113563564215
It <UNK> me . 7.663172638753736
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? 19.00265090682765
Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . 14.103511373335348
Bennet was <UNK> in her acknowledgments . 9.633135738649825
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 12.487982525577989
" She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . " Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . 15.227719146333586
<UNK> , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . " " And do you <UNK> it to either of those ? " " Yes ; to the last . 10.490167458456039
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . " " That is his notion of christian forgiveness ! 20.114696976166552
<UNK> it be so ? " " Oh , lord ! 9.841707169253548
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . 18.782335397479024
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 12.420257310413382
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! 11.271988397211668
He had never had the slightest suspicion . 9.015414652670255
Its business office is located at North <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , . 60.55838414069158
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in <UNK> <UNK> to be her husband , might then have <UNK> in its proper place . 25.713923601824824
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . 12.707316376207881
I have no pleasure in talking to <UNK> children . Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body . 13.45627226037704
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 12.25384128573204
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . " " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " " Has your governess left you ? " " We never had any governess . " " No governess ! 18.355400310270266
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia ' s leaving home . 15.763426674927393
Those who do not complain are never pitied . " Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or <UNK> her would only increase the irritation . 26.438097323850183
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most <UNK> character ! 13.881917225466232
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however <UNK> its existence might prove , had at least <UNK> one day . 21.646041611183755
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . 11.49153493652587
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . 12.51789564190058
" I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . " " Who do you mean , my dear ? 10.602020453560947
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . 11.70235847608786
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . " Mrs . 7.2092081574148
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " " Ten thousand pounds ! 11.683004668404378
Gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , <UNK> of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 14.417288485081563
We dressed up <UNK> in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! 22.292431955380085
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . 19.425039533506148
Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment . 6.4721643684275385
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " Ah ! 14.71341773534814
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <UNK> him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 21.2442670260302
The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . 10.827503598817188
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . 11.05889314458017
" Yes if Darcy does not put it off again . 9.97873206138028
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in <UNK> it after this explanation . " Mr . Darcy , who was <UNK> against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . 20.43084862909611
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . 9.953682358821665
" About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . " " Yes , " replied Wickham ; " his estate there is a noble one . 11.008081822154358
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be <UNK> from it . 13.636182997376716
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away . 11.171591567958334
I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . " " I desire you will do no such thing . 14.273900865414411
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 11.85623051952867
Philips ' s manners and politeness . 8.074568285604563
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . 14.971419307608056
Not a soul knew of it , but <UNK> . 11.13973335395828
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was <UNK> her feelings in <UNK> on Elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . 18.53650656254131
And now here ' s Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 12.60193208206361
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him . 9.131551373502688
<UNK> , <UNK> , . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations . 32.640565883884555
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . " " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be . 12.318167286077443
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . 13.89743289242623
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 8.74048676342121
Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to <UNK> . 12.13486565205925
Not these two or three years perhaps . " " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can . 11.964397494930616
I am perfectly satisfied . 5.8740047512401565
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . 15.801213341928163
Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself . 15.24277143745571
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . 12.520957758093948
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
We will go round the Park every day . 12.918329088875092
" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? " said she . 10.98415143588875
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 12.39125968843818
At such a distance as that , you know , things are <UNK> misrepresented . " " Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips . 13.650678605263643
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest <UNK> ; his <UNK> contracted , his air gloomy . 19.56684391589448
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 11.597351172410255
Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 6.041812349072959
It was a large , handsome , <UNK> building , standing well on rising ground , and <UNK> by a <UNK> of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was <UNK> into greater , but without any <UNK> appearance . 33.50154833481698
Oh , no . " " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . " " No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . " " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . " She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . 12.74275997861507
The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for <UNK> as may be <UNK> to himself and not offensive to his patron . 17.794655699839442
Our poor mother is sadly grieved . 21.389698141607322
Bennet , alarmed . 3.8378532188550967
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <UNK> as these , what would have been her sensations ? 19.601898711568108
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged . 18.388347074697585
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . 18.854790332957013
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . 4.643303951185942
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . 9.158723640332258
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to <UNK> her confidence in it . 14.222549900646088
where is your <UNK> my dear ? " But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 12.71346685902527
CHAPTER XI . 6.932646313148128
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and <UNK> them up , though as she never came without <UNK> some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or <UNK> , she seldom went away without leaving them more <UNK> than she found them . 28.078057616014124
Younge was of course removed from her charge . 11.259277402093176
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 6.401226861827863
I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . 8.184677212589284
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> . 24.381047471417943
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 26.698495742241423
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon <UNK> deliberation , you find that the misery of <UNK> his two sisters is more than <UNK> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . " " How can you talk so ? " said Jane <UNK> smiling , " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . " " I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . " " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 16.792184158589777
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 17.323494240216174
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . 12.632125205611276
If she does not object to it , why should we ? " " Her not objecting , does not justify him . 11.019494009989074
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . 8.910449442080216
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . 15.624755119752859
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . 10.723128106105232
It was then <UNK> in the following manner . 10.317933845284111
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances and to have Mr . Collins instead ! 17.614770914779335
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
" Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . 8.308480395227756
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . 10.507223755453737
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . 9.107477189292982
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this <UNK> recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy ! 16.353597424053387
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 13.872055110447373
How could I be so silly as to wish it ! 8.000218487962906
Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . 17.739831620865793
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 14.964617501310213
It would be such a <UNK> scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . 14.711278873698166
And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined . 13.580285426735772
" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . 3.832004757781481
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 9.326677183654118
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . 9.356185311114984
Oh , Lydia ! " " I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 8.583264192152638
So much the better . 5.682546989429979
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little <UNK> by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . 20.26523086620458
The business was therefore soon settled . 8.776289223940283
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 18.867042286362544
See paragraph . C below . 20.23056236541433
The <UNK> was <UNK> to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so <UNK> a <UNK> . 24.538467188990072
Have a little compassion on my nerves . 13.12059059301913
But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . 10.357594241237516
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . 21.56556534337309
I told my sister Philips so the other day . 7.8052570966549295
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 13.896048449105457
<UNK> laws in most <UNK> are in a constant state of change . 24.612880424804366
CHAPTER <UNK> . 8.450991212750662
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . 15.518853506588485
Bennet with civil self command to Miss Lucas . 12.642726183156782
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . 17.9191909698024
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good <UNK> engaged Mr . Collins ' s conversation to herself . 15.701954217130401
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . " Elizabeth was distressed . 7.853091482647049
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . " Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . 16.819540587951252
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . 17.84474645654588
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> . 20.861900969323386

Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? 19.32344324596594
" I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . " " Not at all , " he replied ; " they were <UNK> by the exercise . " A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . 12.707148477754577
For , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken <UNK> , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the <UNK> reproof . 22.162096352283562
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 11.025928577151175
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? 11.104666455004843

She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . 13.99760154674245
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . 13.950976119591216
I know not what to think . 3.7130321531662283
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very <UNK> manner , with all the <UNK> which he supposed a regular part of the business . 17.869062894470936
" And this is always the way with him , " she added . " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . 8.641725257171474
And a special licence . 11.525410480224881
" It certainly is a most <UNK> affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . 12.070889423510362
In understanding Darcy was the superior . 7.452332957097524
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 16.639320098831966
<UNK> my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . 15.623766472328017
They will never be distressed for money . 9.468929006768613
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 14.6479724072166
His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . 11.489706185761722
She continued in very <UNK> reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 20.466450370189055
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or <UNK> distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more <UNK> blind . 27.182846892686538
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . 20.281656274014594
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ' s regiment . " His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative . 18.318079826852784
When they were all in the drawing room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . 11.669433280001872
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . 17.91074961413708
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation . 17.21643519456541
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . " " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . 15.599893132418732
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . " " Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . 18.04659641395839
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . 18.52632502212831
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 10.836880643777395
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 8.808810281811589
How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! 13.983389337223581
I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 9.445203399960592
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . 18.593741518480936
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe . 10.446392168050536
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay . 9.831852575052928
" He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . 7.778052693401531
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 12.304866276892662
But , alas ! 6.0853703128358525
You know my sentiments . " " You are then resolved to have him ? " " I have said no such thing . 8.186315393589783
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . 11.77589866381513
This Mrs . 3.578867563086468
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . 5.789740481415388
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and <UNK> them , after a short <UNK> , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . 23.29722278239124
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 13.269652578770312
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <UNK> <UNK> necessary . 26.69290364104686
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? 11.123148150334373
After <UNK> their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ? 50.07749521606859
CHAPTER XV . 6.932646313148128
Mr . Collins made his declaration in form . 8.259696862817382
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 15.081100688279749
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . 12.474947979508572
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 11.505441887176499
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <UNK> ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had <UNK> , in his offer to herself . 17.06755167017496
what does he say ? 6.588581251004028
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . 13.343043513168954

Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . 11.302793226357595
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! 14.047172393125336
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . 12.427569597209148
When they repaired to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 12.839557728214059
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 20.54336421078491
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs . 21.308933884611204
If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was <UNK> done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . With respect to that other , more <UNK> <UNK> , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only <UNK> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 20.784945006709506
The express was sent off directly . 12.393913513741376
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . 7.031416439550776
Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " This walk is not wide enough for our party . 13.904825591218863
CHAPTER XVII . 6.932646313148128
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . " CHAPTER VII . 11.991432438836583
On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . 15.617350208115282
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 12.39898420271568
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two <UNK> with Jane again , and the two <UNK> with Lizzy , and the <UNK> " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! 15.32951218600347
He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 10.205266867505733
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . 14.920907512702431
You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not . 6.611157740188607
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . 18.665723142813356
Did you see it ? " Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . 8.445718060066683
you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 16.526868548970455
Philips . The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . 12.085108943175278
Though our kind uncle has done something towards <UNK> him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . 24.0121360520549
They had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister . 11.832064964383097
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . 7.541897025168371
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Poor dear child ! 12.97977950769724
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as <UNK> , were in very good time . 16.81552871285959
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . " " Good <UNK> ! " cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? How could his will be <UNK> ? Why did not you seek legal <UNK> ? " " There was just such an <UNK> in the terms of the <UNK> as to give me no hope from law . 20.631927702239906
Why does she not come in ? " " Oh ! 8.144028197559921
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . 13.50553024574749
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 8.599462780688958
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . 15.896437981974444
Are the others coming out ? " " I do not know . 7.776823763077483
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 11.947639792267482
The <UNK> letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 11.992007582256482
Mr . and Mrs . 2.2607144256097547
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him . 7.995792449225549
Jane was not happy . 3.7619030841582104
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . 8.475599458288512
Can I speak <UNK> ? 16.106952433260304
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . 23.626387408168586
After playing some <UNK> <UNK> , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to <UNK> such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " She smiled , but made no answer . 22.38169541803609
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " " You may as well call it impertinence at once . 14.535375529100392
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 10.933977753641017
so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to every body . That is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . " " Did Charlotte dine with you ? " " No , she would go home . 21.0429818635552
One day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . 13.687840983737852
They could describe an entertainment with <UNK> , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . 25.51869806102373
" My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . " But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . 14.326661618079921
Reynolds could interest her on no other point . 10.62046619750018
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 16.68686657741395
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 12.42410047704239
By you , I was properly humbled . 8.227173345438242
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at <UNK> ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . 19.105787014868017
The hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . 16.04483826464971
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . 14.279844782316232
" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . 12.744719106773653
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 16.939708145988664
" What can be the meaning of this ! " said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone . 7.168770304647867
With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were <UNK> understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged . 18.000062219132232
is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must <UNK> us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . " Then shewing her purchases " <UNK> here , I have bought this bonnet . 21.292430255060935

Mr . and Mrs . 2.2607144256097547
" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr . Darcy ? " " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . " " I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . 11.803598067611185
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . 16.27242634901665
I shall now know how to act . 7.454948698617597
Your idea of the ponies is delightful . 10.160000000653124
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 11.535639292549767
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . 10.585666032034098
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . 15.817599614246996
With the <UNK> concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 17.11314498466771
Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . 11.12175587469384
Bennet . 2.090760509885019
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . 22.62398559200552
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 12.603460205033517
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . 15.30243139486516
Is not it so , Mrs . 4.111344044349218
She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . 18.96631877719491
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more <UNK> purpose . 12.636486957049042
" You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . " " I should be sorry indeed , if it were . 9.410495564290844
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . 13.011380568717296
Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously . " Mrs . 16.117765614935877
" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face . 8.01782428964967
my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned . 7.585148202269431
Such a disappointment ! 8.596218919830777
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 19.904531060970946
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Is nothing due to me on that score ? 13.939442252930887
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 10.585720835883583
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the <UNK> of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . 17.85242353951254
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for <UNK> him also with Lizzy . 14.621336880363458
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . <UNK> are never of so much consequence to a father . 12.980029364613172
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <UNK> , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room . 14.050079942852598
Are the <UNK> of Pemberley to be thus <UNK> ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . 16.497462799647852
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . 12.514281126285987
You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . 12.437672552867623
" But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy . 16.416854178660337
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! 12.368167131760833
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 18.62493720861003
Mr . Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . 16.809431892938147
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 6.6485105677442675
What say you , Mary ? 6.6825982597038625
CHAPTER III . 6.715135170230704
<UNK> more than half a day ' s journey . 13.694157817077762
Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> . 22.171349060618873
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . 11.677836315838485
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . 13.923531760772564
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell . 14.161655320907634
<UNK> would like to go too of all things ! 14.062991161588824
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . 12.307721939019952
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 12.623633840694744
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . 19.57508312785129
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her <UNK> , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . 13.904893831658192
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , <UNK> , manner of talking to her brother . 15.881416917844563
I am so happy . 4.04756885017983
" You look pale . 7.05385133358837
<UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 14.408037162528991
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . 14.742486380563541
But I knew I should persuade you at last . 7.9212919693178465
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . 13.095228195063354
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 16.733401912906373
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 8.660603875175314
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States . 19.253166943968612
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . 20.063007190094943
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . 15.46218527806742
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 7.4476257405839705
You are so strange ! 8.58992440205844
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 18.897190701430144
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent . 19.021489416528567
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my <UNK> and care . 16.461035119706313
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . 11.164647197023587
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . 19.8247265482293
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . 9.6316142222989
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? 15.338900151243415
no , no , this is not likely . 3.96783997641047
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 17.143214990997514
I am very glad you liked her . 6.295125630066947
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! " cried Elizabeth when she had finished it . 12.208650652343353
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 15.502970840726567
It was agreed to . 4.129867588680302
That is the place to get husbands . 8.680155240565188
" Do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; " that is rather singular . " " Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " <UNK> cards . 12.998704970081791
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . 15.35114888509101
I hope he will overlook it . 6.433529249828902
Collins , did I tell you of Lady <UNK> ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? 16.062540080244993
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 10.082544888610075
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 16.4837890675348
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . 7.353536253604906
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 10.629522363443735
My sisters may write to me . 7.389337426189805
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . 10.63945161008309
A clear ten thousand per annum . 33.07523115287973
I want to talk very seriously . 7.79263580856644
Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs . 7.323840291039785
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . 14.595866634062789
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an <UNK> of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . 18.178231037628038
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is <UNK> . " " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs . 11.221176390849395
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . 24.683310658872323
Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . 9.00748388307235
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 8.481504412322511
Could he , or the Lucases , have <UNK> on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the <UNK> more effectually to what they related ? 20.556954033507516
Here , <UNK> , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . 10.250888540150118
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . 10.56032919014341
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . 14.154252165596782
But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! 16.064210458975044
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <UNK> . 18.520202096227067
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been <UNK> , and it had actually been <UNK> that Colonel Forster was going to be married . 19.203801626147534
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set <UNK> . 8.824087215780052
Their table was <UNK> stupid . 19.309273680828596
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . " " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? " " Dearest Jane ! 16.991492868535172
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . 12.499612869976758
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 12.205337540724365
Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . 6.547425819390694
What could be more natural than his asking you again ? 12.894436137263236
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . 11.152995246275294
Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general <UNK> , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . 16.24397320680151
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . 8.425571141302777
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest . 12.911213093399338
Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent <UNK> and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . " Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " You cannot have a right to such very strong <UNK> attachment . 18.597929651149975
I am the happiest creature in the world . 6.98797308940416
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> . 16.96355010235424
Forster . 2.9629106792784143
The other is Miss De Bourgh . 9.25595110623076
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . 14.138844978088287
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 13.653029994648902
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . " " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley . 17.56717814580259
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to <UNK> these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 16.472947353520894
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! <UNK> our surprise . 20.068641948798195
The Foundation ' s <UNK> or federal tax <UNK> number is . 39.12919885324845
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . 12.502281425079357
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 15.188200292915447
I did not think Mrs . 4.057339420523025
<UNK> any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . " " Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . 21.830419149286328
These are <UNK> , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . 13.721506606902981
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . 14.695905677706143
He heard her with astonishment . 5.851209823955279
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <UNK> , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 11.856701785988387
" I cannot make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by <UNK> for being next in the entail ? We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " No , my dear ; I think not . 15.40432343644848
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to <UNK> him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <UNK> of your understanding , but <UNK> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <UNK> , and those which <UNK> the <UNK> ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the <UNK> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 22.72091439122494
" Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy . 5.939964112023388
why did she come ? 8.024271389060052
In , the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg tm and future generations . 30.967961567274003
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . 19.410248481421622
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , Mrs . 8.796686972878428
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> . 25.980566467608128
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 10.57339437239599
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . 14.338527191319239
Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes . 16.779201118620666
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . " " Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> . 26.871672459613222
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so <UNK> with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and <UNK> of her own family ! 16.76767636923564
<UNK> of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . " Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready <UNK> . 19.806248738273265
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 18.27141009682144
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . " " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . " " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " I am not . " Lady Catherine seemed pleased . 12.966631927505519
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 11.557328068467678
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uncle Philips , <UNK> <UNK> wine , who followed them into the room . 19.320883838015583
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . " " I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 11.734195220687724
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an <UNK> of Mr . Darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . 16.715490863965915
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 21.72400748638314
To the civil enquiries which then <UNK> in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer . 14.419635231820875
The path just admitted three . 15.967790050380223
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . 8.346918352771091
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . 13.108644471635927
The discussion of Mr . Collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . 18.499135620716082
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an <UNK> with her brother for talking such nonsense . 20.588191164173736
When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . 14.186568350914222
Its banks were neither formal , nor <UNK> adorned . 39.1770134409701
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . 6.080721242663928
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . 10.463637983204215
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 10.954956995532406
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 12.513548389886068
" Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . " She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . 17.469427301583703
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . 20.179035943465166
how I laughed ! 6.810864259998949
Without a governess you must have been neglected . " " <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . 15.621367835809165
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . " " I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 20.37313046467732
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . 9.526452247990512
Bennet , having <UNK> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . 23.6162415631246
Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in Mrs . 11.335765819638786
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
I am sure my sisters must all envy me . 10.248456132632311
Mr . Bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . 22.264848528802656
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! 24.422625462743774
We do not suffer by accident . 10.943326584739708
Mr . Collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . 19.609487253481348
" I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . 9.751932496557854
You give me fresh life and <UNK> . 15.006796794967942
" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . 10.32677480467312
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 14.718639294732013
My watchfulness has been <UNK> ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I <UNK> in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance . 19.30295856228015
" It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . 11.40692822902261
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 13.197220938681292
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . 13.588367536718568
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . 14.570358275632369
Jane <UNK> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour . 11.504153598463796
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 12.706806837793456
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <UNK> what <UNK> felicity really was . 32.25778679612686
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . 8.030633793442084
I will only add , God bless you . 11.160850392335783
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . 13.124244905452926
Such were the gentle <UNK> of Mrs . 12.19157369762319
At night she opened her heart to Jane . 9.339831829852912
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away . 9.022761057579036
" I hope , " added Mrs . 3.57174417859498
Hurst was observing their game . 11.048074665477232
Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . 11.89639111549907
" His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . 6.811315014918149
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 18.11139578834897
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . 6.886391809457072
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . " He is now gone into the army , " she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . " Mrs . 14.047927685499092
Adieu . 4.562557384159787
He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . " " Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . " He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . 15.542103451528794
You alluded to something else . 8.961436709127135
They agree with me in <UNK> that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the <UNK> of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself <UNK> says , will connect themselves with such a family . 20.20506221230104
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking . 12.18926380165935
can it be really so ! 5.881555845485167
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 16.70808987426071
her liveliness had been never worse <UNK> . 15.359826234860087
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . " " You observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . " " Certainly not . " " To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! 15.750792823698617
Bennet by admiring Mrs . 7.0789361588772906
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <UNK> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . 13.940457962899055
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . 15.898457050539204
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed . 17.429714926192883
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 15.959776697766458
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . " " Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . 15.095758620587839
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . 12.418892786624594
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . 12.223382208992362
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company . 12.943940140157595
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it . 9.598694547266648
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy ! 10.883959083540365
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 19.357441884343444
I know how much you dislike him . " " You know nothing of the matter . 7.080713310505103
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . 9.856291579782573
" And is this all ? " cried Elizabeth . 5.328753828115701
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . " " You are over <UNK> surely . 11.546086372782542
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . 11.125861382237215
what could she mean by it ? 6.42875121465444
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . 16.46195361337208
Perhaps he thought her too young . 7.608521550094693
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 15.13920171179027
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw . 6.580630123404471
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . " Elizabeth could not <UNK> a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . 15.09987772469974
" This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! 12.37966458132191
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 8.420520809271098
On this subject , what can you have to say ? 7.775477194411031
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley ' s heart were entertained . 18.438277796911812
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of Darcy ' s . " " Oh ! 11.461630630908939
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 8.700673569292643
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . 12.399182116522697
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . " " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . " " Pride , " observed Mary , who <UNK> herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe . 13.723045137039248
and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! 13.711427452647222
but no one can throw any blame on them . 11.18365786679786
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . 10.930373217171873
" I admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he . 10.309651941648074
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . 16.26905779063416
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 15.07809955117501
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> . 9.278260479658051
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . 13.176226648922581
After a short silence , the lady first spoke . 9.903728723305957
He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 12.26106922941266
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . 12.222963150625674
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a <UNK> as that , it might be of essential consequence . 12.659865309897963
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? 12.184135452870073
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . 11.650563551315987
Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ' s arm <UNK> to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s . 14.828760275379038
" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . " He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very <UNK> thing , and called out to her , " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr . Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain . 16.534606670325754
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 12.548534253768073
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . 7.577280676390389
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . 12.10177499293599
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 14.812697768747446
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went <UNK> against the <UNK> ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <UNK> <UNK> , and give the praise where it was due . 21.932214291340504
But my dear Lydia , I don ' t at all like your going such a way off . 13.914985811929093
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . 17.90338655622329
Elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . 15.78086760466065
She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . 14.016381098511866
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very <UNK> to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . 9.538677550599727
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 19.989566757851577
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " I have just received your letter , and shall <UNK> this whole morning to answering it , as I <UNK> that a little writing will not <UNK> what I have to tell you . 18.97649804909322
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> . 10.114655287520115
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . 7.96760834298135
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 14.742120695632016
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 18.109739789854814
He was very fond of them . " This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham ' s being among them . 9.555695643601986
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been <UNK> by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 18.015252117912414
She is not such a simpleton . 5.93759075784682
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . 14.47039733084874
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London . 9.621477188903205
" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . 11.023900973030754
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 12.010184801234297
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 10.289466264477307
By nature <UNK> , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James ' s had made him <UNK> . 26.69836707135736
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . " As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . 17.54597965326879
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 6.966122722753422
. 1.3085768265604334
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! 10.798991177742225
Nobody wants him to come . 9.591916163111417
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 22.2677461087121
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . " " <UNK> ! " cried Bingley . 14.363029615273708
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . 5.9967711434343896
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 17.10251062043084
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . " " Oh ! 11.025258605622525
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <UNK> , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the <UNK> way for happiness . 19.367019685827678
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . 11.319399399904826
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled . 16.95303118048303
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ? 14.17904147999129
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 11.71020257691686
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 6.957809311343067
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 10.003775183107612
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us . 17.339745211839574
<UNK> the works from public domain <UNK> editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works , so the Foundation and you ! can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties . 43.98165671879323
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . 13.988157294805408
Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> . 19.88332947935179
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone . 20.666191953091534
CHAPTER X . 6.932646313148128
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . 9.054706841322549
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . 13.565425622516008
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford . 7.392628237961099
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and <UNK> . 21.662926281120008
I have not the smallest hope . 4.794568345568786
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . 13.752991302914928
I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister . 19.006515262704514
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 16.71455445732038
" John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? " " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 12.628810746118107
His words seemed to <UNK> it . 11.645697405086317
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . 13.385743696685331
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . 16.311894165299325
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the <UNK> on guard , and dressing a <UNK> and <UNK> . 35.337000990099014
Collins knew not what to make of him . 5.165086317100205
Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , <UNK> that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ? 15.087691497809345
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . 8.065244923331214
<UNK> may sometimes be purchased too dearly . 27.288582557547937
When I last saw her , she was not very promising . 6.82408618439485
" Wickham so very bad ! 7.013099622699045
" Of music ! 8.509836487502794
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too . 5.568678824346529
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . 18.87034120951449
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . 17.61871447096187
They were natural and just . 6.6205647868768125
If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 11.884563587338526
I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 14.002887283769793
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 18.425558291336333
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . 9.623935604238222
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw <UNK> in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . 17.28071507795605
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! 8.140266791480075
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well . 10.406407173929482
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . 12.821907845509452
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . 15.016118811834428
Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . 12.947098801766085
Elizabeth <UNK> the next morning to the same thoughts and <UNK> which had at length closed her eyes . 19.210381573698918
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried . 6.226108558583218
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? 11.647411002296636
Gardiner , rendered <UNK> by Elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . 20.87397677060939
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach . 18.43421639195087
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley . 9.197109182106518
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage . 19.551627680143877
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . 12.54217972584571
Her affections had been continually <UNK> , but never without an object . 19.248137313717926
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 13.302427452330916

They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other . 10.353023261021441
Lydia ' s going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . 15.521286343376536
Who should suffer but myself ? 14.372561418555765
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . " " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger . 14.505453455969388
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 17.262572256720706
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . " " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . 12.367108583378942
Elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 17.507890099969828
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an <UNK> on every subject . 14.105597857738216
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and <UNK> , and talk and laugh all the way home . 14.887652576400821
<UNK> , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ? 9.951286647724714
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 16.643161579431823
He danced only four dances ! 17.828310372952178
I must have employment and society . 6.645748433192041
But does not Jane <UNK> with the sister ? 10.929629326540976
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 4.343978933302223
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . 9.244683783728966
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . 8.797091477747548
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! How much of good or evil must be done by him ! 17.435005033981774
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from <UNK> in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death <UNK> of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and <UNK> as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly <UNK> her father not to let her go . 17.405279081678053
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . 13.855735664061028
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ' s character . " Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " <UNK> there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 18.233400665802755
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . 9.219427105134654
His temptation is not <UNK> to the risk . " " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment . 14.426421547131705
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the <UNK> road . 17.36904074690738
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . 18.730411047875837
Her report was highly favourable . 11.898480564475323
Her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 12.00841972068607
Oh , Lizzy ! 4.594654387985785
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell <UNK> to mend a great <UNK> in my worked muslin gown , before they are <UNK> up . 27.65743366562136
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . " The wedding took place ; the bride and <UNK> set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . 15.451443755953376
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 22.859824480315876
The particulars , I reserve till we meet . 11.126485619605042
Elizabeth felt Jane ' s pleasure . 6.205790812048068
" Oh ! 3.580881536246356
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 25.919290342767358
A <UNK> life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . 14.979716724382188
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 18.965168663210616
" He only told me , what I have now told you . " Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart <UNK> with indignation . 10.529276643373567
She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 20.03990166373901
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . 14.384324359338096
Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . 22.487458083484743
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners <UNK> respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 18.67475848335515
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey . 15.18342759564822
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . 13.23235251297956
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments . 14.61926822322133
I shall see her in January . 6.441055901568827
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . 11.835679504610166
<UNK> of business too ! 11.970442540844122
Why must she be <UNK> about the country , because her sister had a cold ? 13.972306893753709
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 10.671782709624445
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted , is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK> their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and <UNK> them earnestly . But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . inf
I wonder who first discovered the <UNK> of poetry in driving away love ! " " I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy . 18.474824644340135
<UNK> people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . 16.18427880289408
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 7.073753219554549
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . 14.193218877864197
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two . 16.592831268228753
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . " " Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . " " And do you like her ? " " Very much . " " I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . 10.537074918471687
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard . 19.31373489262875
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . 20.95420548871182
Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <UNK> . 18.849910831520102
But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . " " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . " Elizabeth made no answer . 11.778498088830256
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to <UNK> from the <UNK> qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . 19.533187280302982
Well ! 4.614232971270855

I thought I should have broke my heart . " " I am sure I shall break mine , " said Lydia . 10.643543249663992
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . " " But not before they went to Brighton ? " " No , I believe not . " " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? 11.159405784247971
" I am sorry it went off . 6.615294882552602
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . 7.5871951921060505
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . Oh ! 19.521920008663756
The moral will be perfectly fair . 11.971626901565182
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 13.10617014176406
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . 16.439595722512408
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and <UNK> every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the <UNK> of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 17.67094544153463
This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham . 18.400886476788713
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 15.307903536321527
Not that I care about it , though . 6.182263778443207
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 10.971083046983033
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . 16.742494844026748
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . 10.323297963002775
" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! 11.619777401168564
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . " He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 20.57872223781509
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . 10.09864917966793
<UNK> since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 13.845389869183544
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . 29.823607053705416
Lydia ' s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , <UNK> engaged with one of the <UNK> <UNK> in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little <UNK> , of his house and garden at Hunsford . 15.117225516827807

I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the <UNK> ere long . " " Upon my word , Sir , " cried Elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . 16.056975318615788
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus <UNK> my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to <UNK> your authority in my behalf . 20.680082405358892
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done . 13.78079618859207
She is almost three and twenty ! 9.970158128433777
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I cannot blame myself for having done thus much . 18.01370984199132
A lively imagination soon settled it all . 14.488831449494564
One must speak a little , you know . 6.840872400446343
To his <UNK> engagement with Miss De Bourgh ? 24.49453873298119
All was joy and kindness . 8.25799614757709
" And may I ask ? " said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . " " <UNK> with ! 8.265572493819448
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . 10.924391560947804
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 9.20281423389856
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would <UNK> his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . 20.114258680468282
You see how continually we are engaged there . 13.973901927303336
There can be no occasion for your going so soon . 10.085040776817108
As no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins ' s scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . 10.721256454875604
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . " " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . " Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . 23.357635509549258
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband . 16.03441557065175
But papa is so disagreeable . " " A little <UNK> bathing would set me up for ever . " " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty . 17.217029902687806
It will not do . 3.8760080243373074
" How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! " cried Lydia . 15.315694921053943
My father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . 15.902335068913855
" Yours , c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . 12.52474072925462
That he has neither integrity nor honour . 17.01747651541493
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . 15.290377098650882
You supposed more than really existed . 13.365073495015862
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . 19.562883920869176
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . 10.144374748456826
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 16.96516951114171
He was angry . 4.504252517192857
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 7.892216514937306
good or bad ? " " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . 12.467139727512697
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 9.615738758241186
Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . " " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK> accordingly .

" Yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally <UNK> , without raising all this <UNK> ! 18.170874408770576
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 11.983509884482734
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " <UNK> in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . 13.974482783718242

He could number the <UNK> in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <UNK> . 22.584776209176507
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him . 14.903488432406775
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <UNK> family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . 20.582390427286025
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 17.26177670031507
Bennet was quite in the <UNK> . 6.60913764131325
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . 14.65549894506284
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . " Mr . Bingley followed his advice . 13.545996532055007
" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr . Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing after all . I consider it as one of the first <UNK> of polished societies . " " Certainly , Sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in <UNK> amongst the less polished societies of the world . Every <UNK> can dance . " Sir William only smiled . 22.0889335713724
" <UNK> resentment is a shade in a character . 12.472980236907533
Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 9.993037808826157
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 11.548661387007888
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 14.527258599181287
In the dining room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before . 19.758286197942425
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 18.508939651922944
how I wanted you ! " " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . " " Certainly . 15.159521135208857
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 12.344492140707786
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . " " Indeed ! " " Yes the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> . 16.43299047475134
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . 12.859322280498061
I have not been in the habit of <UNK> disappointment . " " That will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . " " I will not be interrupted . 13.101415442510001
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 18.71779877620836
A few weeks , he believed . 8.405136468333053
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . 12.576307069830191
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . 13.385911450951099
Mr . Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . 13.531197991091224
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . " " I should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother . 13.257103275715252
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . 10.585485984170175
What a contrast between him and his friend ! 10.717831162774647
Bennet give up the point . 6.0585792077010225
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease . 13.298758900689762
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them . 9.083917525860862
Poor Charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . 17.582537096052608
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . 12.088650316978278
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the coachman ' s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs . 20.834779025779262
Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . 12.02763627110396
I send no compliments to your mother . 7.86218507070194
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? " " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . " " Oh ! 11.202549907899693
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and <UNK> , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <UNK> her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . 16.388851735796816
<UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . 11.993791818834627
Kitty and Lydia take his <UNK> much more to heart than I do . 11.982119194292608
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 14.780558220391837
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 17.856190877547373
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s <UNK> her coming so far alone . 20.050310022056202
In <UNK> lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <UNK> in this interference . 19.55836546671569
Philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly <UNK> the invitation . 23.00712644474128
Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . 7.954349813814943
Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual <UNK> ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the <UNK> of his thoughts . 16.51131719626318
It is almost past belief . 11.139189969031495
When this was done , she had a less active part to play . 9.884603438372327
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . 9.794260554787991
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged . 15.844466738202707
Where shall you change horses ? Oh ! 20.266082997720304
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . 11.590096566856637
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a <UNK> denial , and ride off as fast as I could . " " Would Mr . Darcy then consider the <UNK> of your original intention as <UNK> for by your obstinacy in <UNK> to it ? " " Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . " " You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . 21.135453653811968
She has known him only a fortnight . 8.2870643327523
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the per <UNK> . 18.56702396721162
" And pray may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a <UNK> tone , " Is it in address that he improves ? 17.818095241767768
Let me never see either one or the other again ! " Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no <UNK> , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re <UNK> the admiration of her former lover . 24.140902874836957
They have some of the finest woods in the country . " Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <UNK> . 11.985108863944347
Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . 14.56735077386001
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , soon collected them round the table . 20.47198312140453
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great <UNK> . 10.146760075336232
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please . 10.838937298838152
Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an <UNK> sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she <UNK> him . 14.28439829114525
Philips ' s <UNK> was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs . 14.882550280598215
Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . 10.035149594222576
Gardiner . 2.565121365794866
From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . 10.87241361966475
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 17.482398672185692
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 11.441315206288827
They have at least that advantage . " " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . 11.39435468514547
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . " Miss Bennet eagerly <UNK> all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . 19.814449915436068
You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her <UNK> , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . 14.607024696055237
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 18.095971624095824
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 16.124307853010365
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . 11.159021727519123
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <UNK> <UNK> her there . 14.740147819373306
She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . 15.487612287077141
shocking ! " cried Miss Bingley . 7.589555520084689
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . 18.155075988930164
" To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . 7.9923756931001195
What am I to do ? " " Nothing child , nothing . 7.249156385284055
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 19.140056272138928
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . 16.523947910313233
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . 14.27679477658915
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 26.743315999468322
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 14.043532781861076
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . " " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . 12.189553195677801
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 12.589024788416637
" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any <UNK> , rather adds to your other perfections . 16.628904921478192
The next was in these words . 7.387986309385434
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . 17.52206217995501
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and <UNK> of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their <UNK> . 24.037054972935977
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . 11.95879127634958
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
I am glad he <UNK> here on Tuesday . 14.69003526184611
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . 13.158030686373273
Bennet ' s <UNK> looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . 25.44421120458574
CHAPTER II . 6.715135170230704
Elizabeth immediately began playing again . 10.869109237865525
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 12.750449483114526
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> . 17.140255075097492
The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . 23.252533412173577
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . 11.286713029811066
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 9.495326710479393
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 16.773159680967574
It was only said , ' <UNK> , George Wickham , <UNK> . 11.568006604703232
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . " " Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . 12.556042799512563
He has the promise of an <UNK> in General ' s regiment , now quartered in the North . 17.280726225239047
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! 17.483435017487366
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . 8.030477973103471
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 11.471014251674237
I fancy she was wanted about the <UNK> <UNK> . 16.62326831862018
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to <UNK> her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever <UNK> . 16.69411663845808
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . 22.069233659226906
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . 9.615728635732637
Shall you like to have such a brother ? " " Very , very much . 8.086720458725281
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . " " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 10.360911120210874
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a <UNK> of emotion they excited . 15.205686933697146
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 10.457665142334351
<UNK> , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . 11.876459535397725
It was gratitude . <UNK> , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <UNK> and <UNK> of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 22.036501433607132
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 15.375322345297361
Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the <UNK> . 12.511814435523856
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . " " If I were as rich as Mr . Darcy , " cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , " I should not care how proud I was . 12.91369116987151
They were in street . 5.413134690722917
I could hardly keep my countenance . 8.553444917631191
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it . 8.99939991427963
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . 9.08989402494146
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . 16.02512001198253
It is impossible that he should still love me . " After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on <UNK> their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water <UNK> , there <UNK> to be a little alteration . 23.78225067605558
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 14.743295716816428
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of <UNK> and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 22.29249507781281
" I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham . 7.954895500125997
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . 13.821040724178319
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . " " Is that his design in settling here ? " " <UNK> ! 13.316334481718869
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 14.469329848125076
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins . 10.994068113873356
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 11.495869234913787
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 12.997468528686982
It is too long ago . 7.754808345597565
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . 14.609204900763425
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . 13.732389554386842
CHAPTER VI . 6.932646532395619
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one <UNK> idea of any thing . 16.52251777976528

I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother . 9.279720278962287
" There is nothing the matter with me . 5.942499954941399
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
<UNK> felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . 9.314127129289886
At length the Parsonage was <UNK> . 13.678376763351942
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . 4.244641357039277
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . 12.00221633683249
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . 11.912850964997363
CHAPTER X . 6.932646313148128
I speak nothing but the truth . 5.816798842049203
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room . 12.342569450576548
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 9.543876262351455
Mr . Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . 16.091700621782426
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 14.387682821353442
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 14.979560135378447
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas . 33.951326868906825

Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . 9.302989310725767
I remain , dear sir , with <UNK> compliments to your lady and daughters , your well <UNK> and friend , <UNK> <UNK> . " " At four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he <UNK> up the letter . 21.252337280721704
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 16.215370825120026
" E . 3.0104580072345435
Does he know his real character ? " " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . 12.986394558517238
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all <UNK> , if she <UNK> more , and could have the advantage of a London master . 12.308977150904793
Bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone . 12.321539279139031
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . 11.222605907442661
I knew you would be wishing me joy . " " Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . 13.145105342439212
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 11.232144893437074
dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . 8.293449955686782
CHAPTER XI . 6.932646313148128
" She is my youngest girl but one . 7.702477926902283
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette . 9.28655310181202
Her answer , therefore , was not <UNK> , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . 9.756759241876425
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals . 12.825602969794186
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . 8.226255443935207
And poor Mr . Darcy ! 6.250789855169185
" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech . 6.103292820987397
I appeal to Mr . Darcy but let me not interrupt you , Sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the <UNK> converse of that young lady , whose <UNK> eyes are also <UNK> me . " The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 23.74003822808215
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to <UNK> ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . 24.70730166909121
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . 12.005222914582536
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 15.925360890402786
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 18.006209668309133
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the <UNK> . " This was not very consoling to Mrs . 14.060113304671908
" I am all astonishment . 4.137637128833981
" You forget that I have made no answer . 7.26499835148781
He seldom appeared really animated . 17.288229016194794
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . 11.249956713076276
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . 20.18012099713055
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <UNK> shewn . 22.1241424014391
Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . 14.704096094488644
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <UNK> them . 8.387623662702524
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 5.824658496911628
So high and so conceited that there was no <UNK> him ! 17.954696153671314
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! 12.949190336395377
And to be kept back on such a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . " " Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? " " With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . " Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . 21.496769311580223
Forster and me are such friends ! and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? 14.934768589537502

The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was Elizabeth ' s intimate friend . 14.008529986352492
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . " To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . 19.88171280023664
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . 20.499340197627564
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 5.857181113778858
When the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , <UNK> her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment <UNK> . 18.991069725947504
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . 10.65975724536566
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to <UNK> as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was . 10.874382557336185
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . 14.477801617873583
" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s <UNK> in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . 15.018318189912629
" Oh ! 3.580881536246356
" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your <UNK> appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . " " Oh ! 19.762407116299492
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . 11.0743918119334
<UNK> it , Kitty ? " Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . 14.558105253736935
At that moment , she cared for no other . 7.7641343586270954
The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 14.900641375886103
" Good gracious ! 8.833613708295264
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 23.741810445075394
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 8.579043852025563
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , c . 25.312443508526197
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 13.5830011987075
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . 12.825452607504767
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time . 21.584434225658832
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference . 7.693903379513156
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . 9.788289151443866
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " cried Elizabeth . 19.671131619240043
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 10.142304314545628
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . 21.348694784386385
But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 14.735465803648847
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <UNK> to that evening , " said Elizabeth . 12.26160210808619
My youngest sister has left all her friends has <UNK> ; has thrown herself into the power of of Mr . Wickham . 16.511123158016943
Lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . 11.278327296057336
It will save me a world of trouble and economy . 12.475398201772073
I write rather slowly . " " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! 13.374982140633149
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . 15.397018738720437
" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance . 12.030097283536831
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 8.837807894189512
But the case is this . 4.593032101701039
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . 11.4020520160161
Hill began instantly to express her joy . 14.180684080526385
Poor little Lizzy ! 9.960684793911067
I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " " And they must marry ! 10.123550483002541
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . 8.768467582057447
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . " " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . 13.533390854225287
She will be down in a moment I dare say . " He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 10.662701403435308
" Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated . 8.71234607016113
Jenkinson , who lives with them . 7.898126867416099
Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 13.757540210155433
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 17.659398078343578
Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise . 6.6591978955765665
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " I saw you look at me to day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . 11.945255103473103
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid . 32.61384251994967
Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits <UNK> high . 13.788738275456543
Mr . Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . 18.85156608140856
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly <UNK> . 17.387284028620208
Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 9.786448242525903
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ' s . 12.450942191566929
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . 30.167344079412647
They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy . 13.715825784184013
There was also a <UNK> of one thousand pounds . 14.584074119175098
Jane now came up . 6.229666965691155
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 12.566947587529835
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention . 12.659175686825552
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Pray forgive me , if I have been very <UNK> , or at least do not punish me so far , as to <UNK> me from <UNK> . 19.07521911997639
My dear Charles , what do you mean ? " " Yes , all of them , I think . 7.254500326591583
" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . 6.632769264083136
She was busily <UNK> through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . 22.94694486066988
When Mrs . 3.5329542303178307
She represented to him all the <UNK> of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . 13.879757943886245
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . " " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . " " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . " " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . " " But consider your daughters . 12.732069437394491
Well , but now for my news it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? 10.644620264205008
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ? 14.158602782581502
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . 7.874000364730372
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement . 14.117351296333075
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a <UNK> , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , <UNK> to Kitty and Lydia . 20.570921638754122
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . 8.917657865247165
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . 11.169882437008006
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 9.465210345307206
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 17.26399150100194
He was <UNK> for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have <UNK> it . 14.056835367417499
Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 7.838754769576805
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . 12.179370545661973
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . 13.472998265730027
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes <UNK> , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . 16.935354103212823
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs . 16.286490071035935
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . 11.090363099935107
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 19.889795901084653
" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs . 10.22901319926878
I came to try you . 4.713276417575655
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from <UNK> my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . 18.04046596945194
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 14.1383614417136
Hart was the <UNK> of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone . 25.16339571721103
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 16.273435250943052
You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " " You mistake me , my dear . 11.458501230607437
" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? " " To morrow fortnight . " " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . 7.422691009446501
His plan did not vary on seeing them . Miss Bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his <UNK> notions of what was due to <UNK> ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice . 24.700344695083437
" Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss Bingley ; " and pray what is the result ? " " I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect . 10.682734219623152
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . 16.681310026880272
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 14.925072059168844
At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . 7.0386398481326085
Elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several <UNK> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . 22.08457332622787
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 28.672010126756508
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I <UNK> believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . 18.935873010288894
Georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . 20.97016816867205
Two <UNK> , however , were plainly <UNK> from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been <UNK> used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 17.979965297603417
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by <UNK> a <UNK> , or covering a <UNK> . 29.357718921434465

Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 7.027273033116369
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . 21.574165965284198
And is it really true ? 8.825444048604178
To Mr . Bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 16.46771937013224
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 14.871716372143723
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 16.846867530714178
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <UNK> , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . 16.9502687698445
Adieu to disappointment and <UNK> . 12.380431406743815
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . 11.4791178294381
His <UNK> to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 10.864163704527844
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 15.396933215566575
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a <UNK> table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the <UNK> of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . 18.627128987143454
<UNK> wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . 13.69526330305138
And it is the more to be <UNK> , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte <UNK> me , that this <UNK> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs . 14.4831551796759
She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . 14.60975366469175
But I will no longer <UNK> my young cousin . " Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his <UNK> at backgammon . 18.363106768382465
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 10.0792576766036
The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . 15.087074315915345
Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master . 16.975503858999854
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " CHAPTER XVIII . 11.203791903283056
" Don ' t keep <UNK> so , Kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! 21.098105818447927
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 10.54215035119793
<UNK> and pride are different things , though the words are often used <UNK> . 24.20503291910052
<UNK> me whilst you can . " " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . " " Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . " " I cannot believe it . 11.582805153852135
But your arts and <UNK> may , in a moment of <UNK> , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . 13.90496861432324
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . 11.807254164731052
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 17.924912026924734
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! 14.12195587486212
She was ashamed to think how much . 6.593265707994558
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <UNK> her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 14.413451602525486
You must contrive to send somebody . 13.042879857275269
He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? 10.885187782286764
But it must not , shall not be . 3.874648402300511
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr . Darcy . 9.358368266624721
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . 16.51354833131642
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! 22.811965971218704
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him . 6.71487798616989
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " As Mrs . 11.291948182593535
" Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . 8.227095213849822
He cannot know what Mr . Darcy is . " " <UNK> not ; but Mr . Darcy can please where he chuses . 10.448643789855053
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . 18.335468742424826
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <UNK> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . 17.558576509001988
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 12.41769583844523
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . 14.764192860272546
You are a gentleman ' s daughter . 6.849704951611397
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . 12.199609294425942
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . 12.835389619331174
" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . 4.574711165373462
Oh , brother , how kind you are ! 7.006795520958065
At present we have nothing to guide us . 12.432663524501114
They then went away . 7.269323237214952
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 13.686143015627914
I do not wish to avoid the walk . 6.040154585322194
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . " " Ah ! 16.024450997707593
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <UNK> have alarmed her . 18.474848971857167
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . 13.989415461872863
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . " " <UNK> out , " said Mrs . 7.907332112828818
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 18.79254714227368
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 7.597106393734947
Her cousin <UNK> his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the <UNK> of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . " It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . 14.056644594846688
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <UNK> . 14.118850364391824
CHAPTER <UNK> . 8.450991212750662
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " My eldest sister has been in town these three months . 13.701160167357148
My poor father ! 8.856734763872787
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had <UNK> time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 13.679234514396338
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . 8.574598605863034
With <UNK> tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of <UNK> that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . 17.188648424056602
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 13.32144274236461
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . " " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . 15.431969381374618
Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a <UNK> to buy clothes for his daughter . 16.789557492953445
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . " " I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want . " " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " No , indeed . 9.419580858067937
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 12.681935584964558
Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . 19.765228651036104
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may <UNK> to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund . 30.32099682454847
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . " " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . " " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . 11.68712146127013
She <UNK> the days that must <UNK> before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . 21.50387966460428
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months . 10.442986380176771
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <UNK> your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter . 17.240097114376074
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . " " But my father cannot . He wrote last week to hurry my return . " " Oh ! 14.870250006577347
His apparent partiality had <UNK> , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . 16.513449088419048
But , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 13.586813896965024
Collins well . " " Yes , very well . 4.430301487554953
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 11.079043370134968
No thanks to his gallantry for that . 7.871064111273505
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . 12.976535901957156
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <UNK> . 17.60798282716248
You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! 15.558264328710392
He bore it however with admirable calmness . 16.44468745621504
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . 6.4828399230119285
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 12.25782235813954
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . 9.635914458474769
Is not general incivility the very <UNK> of love ? " " Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . 12.94842534169403
And one of my own daughters . 6.186446867166455
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . 6.057207401251777
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 17.51826881147607
How odious I should think them ! " " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " " I am afraid you do not like your pen . 12.68069437210646
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . 10.269416455630362
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 15.694088746212874
CHAPTER XII . 6.932646313148128
" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the <UNK> that is laid on them , as nonsense ? 13.871819805889476
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long . 22.36682666560999
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . 8.896860712972815
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <UNK> on such a research ; in which <UNK> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally <UNK> , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . 20.68606273339398
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . 18.124952059495566
Mr . Collins ' s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . 9.787195096857301
It must be an amusing study . " " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing . 17.82615455275415
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 14.471657680789722
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 13.903220653178956
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . " " No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me . 10.209132436991611
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern <UNK> , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . 18.010215208969225
You will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . " He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit <UNK> long . 14.379177043453357
<UNK> recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be <UNK> . 16.909313802159623
Such very superior dancing is not often seen . 14.03157504444041
" I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ' s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . 12.420281472839772
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 14.70821969051616
" Good Heaven ! 8.71803730721328
How are you all ? " " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 14.561312006800632
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 12.644341858980418
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 8.12909296260254
I don ' t know . 8.472979937029052
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 16.74171970062037
Gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . 11.28630383121677
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 10.948362830796155
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! 13.281300886678851
" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . 10.096600161344343
Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . 9.105913347909665
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . 9.239779379229278
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . 9.759893905133861
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 19.89763167832067
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the <UNK> light , seemed most improbable . 20.327747781856026
In Three Volumes . 13.746175663774439
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! 15.187549981379195
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <UNK> , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her <UNK> and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , Lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . 18.014706695466533
Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . 9.7797285280913
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . 9.842010737586623
Who could about such a <UNK> little <UNK> thing ? " Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <UNK> and fancied liberal ! 29.411980874683778
Long and the Gouldings soon . 7.30823642623688
Elizabeth hoped she had <UNK> him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 12.63416117627326
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week . 16.29927899180619
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . 14.967308656227933
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the <UNK> of a considerable <UNK> , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . 29.919652582817307
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 9.765817951540328
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . 16.392984724711436
If I could but see you as happy ! 7.507017759886754
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . 10.091228069216317
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 14.874937588485539
She had high <UNK> spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . 18.171822746621114
Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s <UNK> , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any <UNK> of sentiment . If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error . 19.778658596354052
" Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " for Mrs . 4.989306794405807
I shall <UNK> it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . " And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh ! 15.827377824655116
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 14.071153713934628
I had not an idea of it . " Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . 9.011352665506603
" Then , who taught you ? 7.579418737463017
Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . 7.807711271151438
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged . 16.551818111615113
I cannot understand it . 4.610803891764729
The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in <UNK> and <UNK> , and the evening at one of the <UNK> . 16.280196332856654
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . 19.62362008646799
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? 11.92724337091646
I told Mrs . 3.5741058905488314
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . " " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were <UNK> and insolent . 12.556003996118667
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . " " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . 12.235628589632727
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she <UNK> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . " Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . 14.023281813355577
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and Mrs . 16.34109946987624
Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . 13.246440944841284
He has not an ill natured look . 10.733397349609218
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . 13.934701399874175
Bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . 13.995816660535759
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? 17.33617486058073
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy . 12.851881290843943
Reynolds was of no trifling nature . 9.938256372509256
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister ' s being in town . 9.656252326254764
A fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . 11.55143470740272
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . Bingley was <UNK> to Darcy by the easiness , openness , <UNK> of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . 18.597089757310933
She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband . 11.000812567501873
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 10.284059879477223
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation . 18.083496821798512
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . 19.62209248163993
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs . 7.033753142227799
The visit was returned in due form . 11.675072470446263
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> . 15.424759758665777
Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side . 13.89868311778229
" <UNK> in other words , you are determined to have him . 8.225401734259293
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 20.436344656438905
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 11.558470165101362
My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them . 17.881979035656002
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . 34.92923851688665
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose <UNK> of <UNK> support . 45.82489260546623
CHAPTER XVII . 6.932646313148128
CHAPTER XIX . 6.932646313148128
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over . 31.633814127888776
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . 9.590834204460467
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry <UNK> , a very mean art . " " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is <UNK> in all the arts which ladies sometimes <UNK> to employ for <UNK> . 19.957039308421546
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 10.237944123256804
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . 18.31764177625694
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 11.179965022394073
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " Their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . 21.305797864935027
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . " Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative . 8.377981534571484
Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . 13.836730463701828
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon <UNK> up every private care ; and covering her face with her <UNK> , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . 17.059391399151433
Lady Catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . 19.378251409433837
I dare say he often <UNK> worse things said than I am going to say . 17.878770821066844
Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt . 9.594894843775416
I shall go distracted . " This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . 17.200519303980673
such an openness and gentleness in his manner . " " There certainly was some great <UNK> in the education of those two young men . 17.292516673216113
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . 12.405329438899127
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Mr . Robinson . " " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? 16.91244497951509
But it was not to be . 2.7991272738207384
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only <UNK> off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . " When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . 23.511482074477687
" You quite <UNK> Mr . Darcy . 7.23740911370928
Bennet could hardly contain herself . 9.160600538572133
Mr . Darcy <UNK> you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . 8.636213114171374
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . " " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . 14.455318976761122
So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 18.205868518034457
His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 14.891845468021215
Your ' s , c . 5.272843781351793
But our visitor was very obstinate . 11.546410161990583
" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . 10.65340972027543
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 11.215805867826665
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! 18.937859133421952
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 12.811211386126852
This room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . 16.287902307616474
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church . 14.223797460416199
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . 13.400412565268176
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . " Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . 17.867106919857754
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and <UNK> in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . 15.525150717782962
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <UNK> of Mrs . 10.469057877843063
But these things happen so often ! 15.640291165000136
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 14.018652101519663
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 5.028995828125203
But I know the foundation is unjust . 8.84916465416023
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 8.299386654595242
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 13.93122094035293
Gardiner was so little to be trusted . " " You must not blame my aunt . 8.407942874526945
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . 9.693588908964829
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . 16.790957561660004
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . 20.048868649411126
" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . 7.71546698839935
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . 10.979213180527609
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia . 13.600833482655707
Of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was <UNK> with admiration was evident enough . 18.553917417939488
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas ' s last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the <UNK> were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three <UNK> <UNK> at least . 23.969389559444664
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 12.027079599936009
Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 12.31078243887633
He is a pleasant fellow , and would <UNK> you <UNK> . " " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 14.749684503623946
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the <UNK> of my father ' s will , has been <UNK> acquainted with every particular of these transactions . 23.024999411095973
Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ? 15.589667423662442
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . 15.756267836726298
" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the <UNK> <UNK> above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <UNK> than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . 20.93407450462823
" This is wholly unexpected . 8.13452160262407
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . 9.69317434214367
Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party . 11.00173741685693
Collins . 2.3080916685049706
Her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 18.754670736089178
are sufficiently known . 7.604277810884796
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s . 15.42768508418796
Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . 13.221847747956325
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! 13.719144981947366
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <UNK> , but Mrs . 9.043594647442106
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 7.9439223130459435
I thank you for explaining it so fully . 11.001631842817545
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 13.57518811042925
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . " " In what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought Elizabeth . 18.021068672545212
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . 6.4477716720348255
" I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth . 7.7851965473257305
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . 17.81456684904998
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . " CHAPTER VI . 13.887936943647302
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph . 17.004832755265262
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . 16.56560541733396
Good Heaven ! 10.768482509438485
He was well , but so much engaged with Mr . Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . 7.64159848598822
He now wished it more than ever . 8.278331644849068
" I see what you are feeling , " replied Charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to marry you . 8.908097420122521
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 23.557620473681748
My affections and wishes are <UNK> , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . " Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very <UNK> , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . 18.434624993544038
Bennet and the children . 3.4868814289550225
Elizabeth was delighted . 3.8455495340105332
" He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . 16.080488030223925
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 17.55489630278115
She comes to us to day . 5.835149076573012
She is grown so <UNK> and <UNK> ! 21.993545141976114
She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> . 15.746916381656126
I dare say the <UNK> upon Mrs . 10.89109484557689
" You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . 10.717398247125313
And when you have given your ball , " she added , " I shall insist on their giving one also . 11.248350470894096
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . 16.024531618855757
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . 17.588583330012494
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . 13.386039877603755
Mr . Darcy <UNK> it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . 14.251669602461808
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 13.163131878773676
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so <UNK> . 13.471551715837043
Could there be finer symptoms ? 20.581362496351993
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 12.741413550486312
During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <UNK> , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . 17.490612195801713
Bennet , who assured him with some <UNK> that they were very well able to keep a good <UNK> , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <UNK> . 13.9798616584039
" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . 11.20776488003233
I promised them so <UNK> ! 12.246169035716257
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 19.953512806714794
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . 6.180476951029513
" Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our <UNK> way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . " Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and <UNK> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 13.55701093626837
" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . " Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . 16.801242978093217
GARDINER . " " Is it possible ! " cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . 8.623202991437408
Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . 11.461804797995397
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance . 28.586554150479675
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the <UNK> , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 14.405361826280613
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " CHAPTER <UNK> . 19.331323830424097
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish . 11.476816837101987
Your ' s , c . " Mr . Darcy ' s letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last . 8.81379522884451
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of <UNK> was delightful to her , and she began her song . 20.987791637620738
" I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . 7.133386619410222
" Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 13.331635144769873
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> . 12.517801558506068
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions . 18.629095804698746
They soon <UNK> the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . 8.16526898901495
" Your ' s , c . " This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be <UNK> , by the sister at least . 14.21633007780941
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . 14.670158968900155
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . 16.09723992920906
A younger son , you know , must be <UNK> to self denial and dependence . " " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either . 16.883472562987766
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one <UNK> of perfect <UNK> in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his <UNK> that her manners were not those of the <UNK> world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . 24.996354795194634
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 16.50186139239285
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 11.887911725808946
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to <UNK> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . 25.750333956666193
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and <UNK> <UNK> with great perseverance . 22.686875180475734
She has two nieces of her own . 7.255053517916219
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , <UNK> to invite him to sit by herself . 19.25919050977135
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . 7.911014881134314
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " " You have . 10.522021937843272
I am quite well . 4.504032133709558
Miss Bennet had <UNK> ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . 11.095892491090718
She could think only of her letter . 5.287043696495172
I am not equal to it . 3.869893029503137
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united <UNK> . 21.144106311337396
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth . 9.156434712651333
U . S . laws alone <UNK> our small <UNK> . 41.84084982116161
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 18.50135768070113
It seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary <UNK> , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . 25.14448649980186
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . 11.477847807891756
<UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her . 17.89845382540044
Mr . Bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is <UNK> with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . " She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . 16.365394338056102

Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . 10.490490434422851
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 12.204152611154754
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 16.9759541567327
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so <UNK> to you . 22.302682212389268
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 7.325524474173586
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . 13.145670973048983
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her <UNK> you . " Mrs . 8.034369565780228
The vague and unsettled suspicions which <UNK> had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 20.805845757594657
The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 14.730809734284556
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so <UNK> that I cannot answer for being <UNK> . 18.199162305940774
Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . 10.629696999486658
It is of all subjects my delight . 7.678113032750169
how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would <UNK> you about to all the balls . 10.021847029730239
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 15.012870568945598
I am sick of them all . 5.323308146014193
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her <UNK> . 19.60281483788922
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " Darcy mentioned his letter . 8.77679223201463
But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he <UNK> that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 13.461954321471767
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . 4.797359934671032
But that is nothing to us . 4.426771374911582
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . 13.835597653562882
I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . " " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . 10.97097435870203
Bennet was <UNK> the fire . 8.953732403302133
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . " " My beauty you had early <UNK> , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . 14.005749980313391
Poor Jane ! 7.043004130287371
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 13.486969939342222
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! 9.333102680562435
The day passed much as the day before had done . 8.469505135014694
Its <UNK> depended on others . 23.793194466374832
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that . 13.834075536949367
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . 13.555877328420474
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! 15.342953538849718

I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! 17.2956483535451
He was received by Mrs . 5.0289955471703
III . 4.190188405314571
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good <UNK> will <UNK> it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth <UNK> lest her mother should be exposing herself again . 26.05778544115577
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . 11.777730082176257
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such <UNK> sisters , home could not be <UNK> , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake . 14.160719100409004
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . 20.104572452160614
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . 10.819839758554378
For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently . 16.07960691967192
" This will not do , " said Elizabeth . 4.092510965046283
How are they even to be discovered ? 10.075446837983591
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 7.0184122957266135
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . 8.085451758781835
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <UNK> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 18.575624086914637
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 16.027087357620953
Gardiner smiled . 5.220986586949765
Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . " " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . " " I believe , Ma ' am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . " " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . 10.633349783883963
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 10.606749257957743
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . 15.5814940513835
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <UNK> , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 13.734488487924608
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? " " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . 13.04801422777662
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . " " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be <UNK> with . 8.570584735591915
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth <UNK> out the coffee , in so close a <UNK> , that there was not a single <UNK> near her , which would admit of a chair . 19.183134566240927
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 18.3407690587268
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 18.752784663506183
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him . 11.640802181138769
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . 17.37077831486121
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had . 11.573413927135789
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . 8.420914562627853
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its <UNK> was visiting and news . 15.414049953925153
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . 12.347275823148149
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <UNK> . 16.641678450891114
You refuse , then , to oblige me . 6.665806824541549
I am not <UNK> you know . 6.90639431127904
Why any fear of detection ? 14.3319657654774
The day of his and Lydia ' s departure soon came , and Mrs . 7.395164415636531
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . 10.879130881501421
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . 10.854989112027827
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed . 16.17409319093496
" Oh ! 3.580881536246356
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they <UNK> . 11.240672311780093
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . 10.298381063096695
" I do not get on at all . 4.585739701195384
You know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . 12.260369388123221
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 15.365322232287175
If gratitude and esteem are good <UNK> of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 25.686758642163902
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . 16.443844371114547
I am not at all afraid of her dying . 6.604242242291866
And what sort of young lady is she ? 9.344897868673902
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 6.187617932647762
" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides <UNK> tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! " Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . 23.838897248917966
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever . " Darcy was fixed in astonishment . 11.377712881295183
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening . 14.666695455467295
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 13.724639743718717
It was to this effect " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well . 18.176874251708167
If your feelings are still what they were last <UNK> , tell me so at once . 15.7743478837343
She saw with the <UNK> eye of fancy , the <UNK> of that gay bathing place covered with officers . 26.517651082988316
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 14.485544205274145
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your ' s seems to have been . 14.696667495776042
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 16.83019662795541
And do you really love him quite well enough ? 12.837888939100635
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <UNK> . " " And this is your real opinion ! 13.853593090683436
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . 16.158481207457612
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as <UNK> of derivative works , <UNK> , <UNK> and research . 36.71750229597034
They <UNK> every attempt of Mrs . 11.52880276278482
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different <UNK> ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . 27.976264523099946
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <UNK> in the gaieties which that season generally <UNK> , and that your <UNK> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall <UNK> you . " " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . " " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . " " Why will you think so ? 19.02862558133608
But pride where there is a real <UNK> of mind , pride will be always under good <UNK> . " Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . 21.70423478242144
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . 6.031847529774051
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . " " That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever heard you utter . 12.688278730125202
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head <UNK> acutely . 24.535257414212637
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away . 14.2691020985742
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . 11.425199874582992
Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time . 14.250415461050894
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! 13.213649355840442
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 13.265081621889236
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . 9.126634849271518
only think ! 4.7714535702078535
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so . 10.701281150527732
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 10.156036262211352
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 10.705324139285727
They crossed it by a <UNK> bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a <UNK> , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the <UNK> <UNK> wood which bordered it . 31.360346421633793
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said . 14.661947131054948
I would keep a pack of <UNK> , and drink a bottle of wine every day . " " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . 16.611529052896003
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 12.6035281598184
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . 11.660297345067079
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . 11.407017174160593
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . 11.746600839594365
There is a mixture of <UNK> and self importance in his letter , which promises well . 16.12774697416836

They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . 13.59363758898843
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 10.16816368310526
For your sake , " turning to Charlotte , " I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for <UNK> estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh ' s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? " " A little . " " Oh ! 18.659334055729623
I am afraid you will be angry . " " My dearest sister , now be be serious . 9.031377898973437
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard <UNK> in any of the family . 21.1718164605686
They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . 18.690310637567002
" Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . " He should be particularly happy at any time , c . 10.848479922432047
What is your own opinion ? " " That it ought not to be attempted . 9.79795489520644
Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! 13.75672729419004
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . 17.18409741898554
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no <UNK> the frequent mention of Wickham ' s name . 12.397599391225157
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 17.51251304977824
" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . 11.49287608827561
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . 9.65772806713167
Gardiner . 2.565121365794866
and his sisters are charming women . 8.15746716110066
CHAPTER VIII . 6.932646313148128
Such was Miss Lucas ' s scheme ; and <UNK> were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . 17.71766965656215
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 14.176300956803663
" While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . 10.944436979941909
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 17.421377592003328
A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it <UNK> from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . 18.414141604017473
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . 17.054100648813122
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 16.932509682304886
Charles , when you <UNK> your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 13.112705562603432
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
" Of a fine , stout , <UNK> love it may . 12.525734563917766
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 10.378246486552273
" Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 11.304588843642062
It is unaccountable ! 8.50834060270499
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his <UNK> were at the same time so vague and <UNK> , that her mother , though often <UNK> , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . 21.182762703966507
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 12.8693122301725
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
At length , she spoke again . 7.274997038871018
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . 20.14441357026158
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 10.394561535473555
" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently . 12.153006295019972
why is not every body as happy ? " Elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . 15.769208895563745
Lord bless me ! 13.309563798257479
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? " A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and <UNK> and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . 22.202825764976108
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , <UNK> my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " " It is well . 11.750948312280718
She now lost every expectation of pleasure . 9.932367575779011
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 16.05482472021418
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . 11.974728799797122
Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to <UNK> it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . 17.32789281170265
But his pride , his abominable pride , his <UNK> avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in <UNK> , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . 18.547085443574375
In the hall they parted . 8.48260062596783
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . 15.017239243007545
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 16.077654162210585
She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 15.783485679658044
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my <UNK> on your privilege of universal good will . 20.005746051029128
I am very , very sorry . 4.277402915310805
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Long . 3.4517701468536797
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy ' s meditated elopement . 16.770120062697778
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and <UNK> study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . " And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his <UNK> she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . 28.50288553991714
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 10.388642645684916
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the <UNK> kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . 13.78397788972302
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas . 7.622072694017812
It was a rational scheme to be sure ! 9.125800964626587
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their <UNK> concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 16.348330064945593
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such <UNK> , and her intreaty that she would not give into it . 13.1258123568282
But though every thing seemed <UNK> and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <UNK> ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . 18.992786278788024
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . 5.196077666672371
" I am sure there is not on his . 4.656979214744651
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . 12.97671455654955
Dear me ! 7.123479922886215
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth ! 12.014163288151245
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 7.174461595598193
Very well . 4.842666455257076
With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . 16.366363930466374
We had better not mention it . 6.723254107635955
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . 15.37021012598202
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . 12.172664585098312
Lord ! 5.738515514804995
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 10.574045015319106
Collins and myself sincerely <UNK> with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the <UNK> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 18.165952662461173
You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and <UNK> all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg tm works . 32.12931124822434
Are not you curious to hear how it was <UNK> ? " " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . " " La ! 12.64626033078233
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . " Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right . 13.577978345070898
<UNK> for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public <UNK> , but I wrote to Mr . Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs . 14.030813703684286
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . 14.125258221252324
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 23.46363842317791
Bennet . " My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received <UNK> at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right <UNK> Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose <UNK> and <UNK> has preferred me to the valuable <UNK> of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <UNK> myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those <UNK> and <UNK> which are <UNK> by the <UNK> of England . 37.027559279307575
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . 11.406893649836569
You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs . 10.319258032635716
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . 12.443187010059493
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 16.099881094264862
CHAPTER XIX . 6.932646313148128
The journey would moreover give her a <UNK> at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . 13.42521173783902
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . 11.438264453113277
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? " " I think she will . 10.716027982299272
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . 14.875446964221329
But are you pleased , Jane ? 6.1363391395435665
" And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 13.477874542841569
Make haste , and come down this moment . " Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . 23.048556676025203
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . 15.582457107802155
Nor was Darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 14.361088765103524
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 15.786890872772778
It was very little less . 5.382523138613296
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason . 12.191705261861989
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so . 23.228349517961774
If the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the <UNK> . 35.228537385743486
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted <UNK> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <UNK> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . 27.102769925514878
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? " " Nearly three weeks . " " And you saw him frequently ? " " Yes , almost every day . " " His manners are very different from his cousin ' s . " " Yes , very different . 13.890944712600785
My mind was more agreeably engaged . 12.06120942587953
She shared in their attendance on Mrs . 10.539895538451235
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . " Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . 21.24276575743921
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of <UNK> should not be broken in on . 14.650350189634132
The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood . 29.093403601983596
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 8.166238598030656
But , Lizzy ! 3.940766491830952
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ? 16.415636452164808
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 16.922034604003
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 13.48716321310427
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . 20.619142021457378
Mr . Darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . 5.943397967858674
Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 10.672883408958388
CHAPTER XVI . 6.932646313148128
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " <UNK> so I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . 12.17021583311236
On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . 23.94156063981442
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 13.326644291286431
I was given good <UNK> , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 13.193604181092955
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . 22.28382452788559
I do not deserve it . 4.713546916810243
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional <UNK> in praise of his own humble abode , and the <UNK> it was receiving , he was happily employed <UNK> the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . 21.04221689589915
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it . 15.024405210676267
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . 13.053711475162237
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and <UNK> the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 20.810808794559804
Whatever bears affinity to <UNK> is <UNK> . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 23.606237526818475
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 16.70294855027469
His debts are to be paid , <UNK> , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased . 17.093927944153222
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . 11.74145219346653
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or <UNK> reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . 20.545892843220905
" I cannot see why Mrs . 5.9567351707061835
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 18.65176690147741
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . " " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . 16.40430204961193
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 11.996750815148534
He begged pardon for having displeased her . 14.781740381626582
" No ; but it must be done soon . " Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . 15.64121635652072
But now it was all too natural . 6.842156505848849
She had no fear of its <UNK> farther , through his means . 14.086200133628173
Not all that Mrs . 4.580173562784462
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees . 15.456428407207369
Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a <UNK> chaise . " " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . 10.623049655307373
A small sum could not do all this . " " No , " said her father , " Wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a <UNK> less than ten thousand pounds . 14.489580362872793
Is not he a charming man ? 8.999167522024665
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . 8.040813776947031
Lydia was Lydia still ; <UNK> , <UNK> , wild , noisy , and <UNK> . 16.46302001230893
But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . " " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother . 8.529843234578397
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . 16.93918041268572
They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . 11.564247665667397
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . 13.712357329624858
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . 21.24630488160718
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . 16.59978424563236
Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 15.084068943353405
On Saturday he came again . 9.477989713539875
I am so grieved for him . 5.3921487392824154
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . 9.7740104759842
" Mrs . 2.058831132353435
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . 6.723238926538886
Long has promised to introduce him . " " I do not believe Mrs . 8.457670197096542
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <UNK> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . 22.550541064099082
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . " CHAPTER V . 25.72878520597872
Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 9.054157672102141
" What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? 5.994323521780636
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 13.936744577571138
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . 8.116344145006261
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . " Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . 6.028730466680099
She practises very constantly . " " So much the better . 10.81829311804639
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . 15.481843968881892
<UNK> inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in <UNK> ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the <UNK> Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . 33.02663153831801
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . 10.458589071214009
He readily agreed to it . 6.741938974030672
You have done all this ! 6.742353957054309
There is no indignity so <UNK> to their feelings ! " She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " " And quite alone ? 20.80802076774384
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some <UNK> , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings . 16.8505201537657
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 15.650275580161068
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 11.184920362336268
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what <UNK> his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 14.099069744545849
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . 8.27329475977133
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . 14.909827580409747
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable . 11.513795754593225
Long . 3.4517701468536797
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ' s way . " Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <UNK> . 16.54203481280188
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . 8.722731028897757
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 13.645589880263033
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . 16.33055843784761
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it <UNK> , has surprised me a good deal . 14.630650608628159
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 10.141782040911067
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 9.369933953734154
Her own thoughts were <UNK> her . 12.165085268187187
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . 14.66618576914419
Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . 13.338563501446579
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . 13.584487485402182
Mr . Darcy replied with great <UNK> , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley . 8.524473569958777
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 8.739911159807203
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . 19.552280457975794
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . 17.071587043930727
" He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . 12.833095894064389
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 17.490984462864795
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 15.333255919295764
CHAPTER XIV . 6.932646313148128
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her <UNK> being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 16.38059585818608
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth . 11.487862851906653
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 17.70773631705209
I have no such <UNK> to resent . 9.496597642856015
Your mother <UNK> upon your accepting it . 19.10034035049839
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . 15.363099860891607
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present <UNK> of good will are highly <UNK> , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . 26.266576693381435
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . 7.781019275682673
There was no want of discourse . 7.7877284470113715
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . 16.864141362042773
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome . 18.69307063548623
But I confess they would have no charms for me . 9.560057365416833
The pause was to Elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . 8.577582059557603
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <UNK> at the <UNK> of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time <UNK> her natural degree of sense , since the <UNK> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be <UNK> , was likely to be <UNK> in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a <UNK> place and a camp . 31.416198669325144
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . " " For heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr . Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . " Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . 16.104496841780712
She will be taken good care of . 7.348629705451217
I know no harm of her . " " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her <UNK> ' s death made her mistress of this fortune . " " No why should he ? 13.544708384040604
Now is your time . 5.977066895610555
" I am , dear Sir , c . 4.759540940904478
If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 16.711132480875122
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement . 23.34686489051352
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <UNK> recommendation , and to assert that I had <UNK> all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . 17.725270728487875
Gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the <UNK> fashions . 17.567345583071642
my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . " " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . 12.721854118629537
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . 8.446662214816877
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . 15.579592750912918
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 12.218505316246533
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 19.504083122680537
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . 20.869411131477275
Her ladyship was highly incensed . 13.11936775113968
Hill and the two <UNK> . 9.087225500084752
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 19.325628365384148
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 16.607376271624172
It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 21.702542982049376
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 13.461131800070483
They were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs . 11.6241950089492
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 23.676912299236665
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 14.191411491123441
What a good joke it will be ! 9.57368760897319
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister . 9.035918090952121
I will not tell you what it is . 4.686476312225463
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger <UNK> than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance <UNK> and <UNK> . 16.21439093456792
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 16.19726825421398
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure . " The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs . 23.144610149603338
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does . 9.136044646464292
what felicity ! 6.1226535642166535
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 12.892302673067983
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . 12.599286453113553
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 10.177530668244753
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . 8.508864006878339
no . I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . " " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may <UNK> our different opinions . " " No I cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . " " The present always <UNK> you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt . 15.278187267548725
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 12.915013492057298
I depend on you for that . " To these high <UNK> expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the <UNK> of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . 14.689293454217504
" Good Heaven ! 8.71803730721328
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <UNK> . 15.734086937086449
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though <UNK> with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 11.539998310904291
He was full of joy and attention . 7.27126165981125
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 17.845872899223753
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> . 10.761241465873072
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 21.278530423392965
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . 13.19544755631963
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? 12.889724272647355
" When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! I who knew what he was . 8.98288294522162
Bingley was the principal <UNK> , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 10.224977262031247
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this <UNK> . 20.523809053252087
Have not you always hated him ? " How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! 23.395384956742188
But we must <UNK> the tide of malice , and <UNK> into the wounded <UNK> of each other , the <UNK> of sisterly consolation . " Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " <UNK> as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is <UNK> that one false step <UNK> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <UNK> than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 28.919558051936225
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than <UNK> . 17.456711695035466
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long . 14.363199256910312
She was humbled , she was grieved ; she <UNK> , though she hardly knew of what . 10.64502985652142
He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . " " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . 15.079091182863085
" Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared . 8.204218671801364
Gardiner abused her stupidity . 11.343303557889024
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . 16.002166398970157
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 7.018767191621002
It was really a very handsome thought . 7.234549819680068
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . 18.82005371916
Lady Catherine de Bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . 14.704580425247718
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . 13.451103677913311
Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . 8.035965482766363
She was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . 17.93343848804408
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . " Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . 8.709103033794893
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 16.31220839533609
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 18.355566147070533
Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 7.217484764643402
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 9.26638614313539
On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and told her with great <UNK> that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . 18.175582525158866
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . 16.250515770308986
A person may be proud without being vain . 15.18789659447753
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ' s two sisters . 17.175677154407737
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook , complying with the rules is very easy . 19.90829785658094
A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone . 10.563469143003696
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , <UNK> painful to me . 11.138755571338342

Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 13.715344168386254
Elizabeth , <UNK> all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . 13.56166015915447
I ought not to have said a word about it . 5.903838405966156
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . 10.407293191819157
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 7.066369425806246
But I have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous <UNK> , boy in the world . " Elizabeth almost stared at her . " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she . 16.55430336147725
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some <UNK> neighbour , who could not be enough <UNK> , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 22.297781982723826
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <UNK> , readily obeyed . 17.111927910400198
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 32.489373165703064
But with me , it is not so . 3.5959436492849317
" But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . " Elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . 13.589749367402508
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not <UNK> a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . 19.99243080059712
Did he know of their intending to go off ? 12.398856260885223
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . 9.868107747780448
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . 6.18972208267234
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a <UNK> . 13.352078844119125
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? 18.147902829577973
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so <UNK> courted you . 21.524958581884043
She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . 10.118542719793977
And his behaviour , so <UNK> altered , what could it mean ? 13.598382817790817
The <UNK> <UNK> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have . 18.25835449225266
Lady Catherine ' s great attentions to Mrs . 7.918997216336472
As for your Elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what <UNK> could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye <UNK> , so remarkably fine , might be copied . " At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . 17.27287901939409
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 13.057288238201881
And she was only sixteen last June . 12.181419518913247
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister . 15.023658648002705
It was over at last however . 6.548884468630258
In Three Volumes . 13.746175663774439
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 17.949278834429922
<UNK> pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . 10.810874513042672
" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire . 10.518631511563477
Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by <UNK> to his sister . 12.739367169247759
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 13.067975788299261
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <UNK> , distance becomes no evil . 26.75338927290298
His attachment to Rosings , certainly <UNK> . " Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 13.253222387419896
" You write uncommonly fast . " " You are mistaken . 10.541046227257507
" He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 11.621230469317547
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . 8.552988518660854
in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 11.819830299092633
From that moment I observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 17.04148966541766
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . 21.329246865118314
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! 16.44143135425547
Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . 5.701975616909143
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 18.984108189933238
" But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not <UNK> his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . 12.963737963853617
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my <UNK> from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . 25.770580307667682
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his <UNK> to myself . 13.820456409205178
what has she to do with it ? 4.932258077330161
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 8.130354347053334
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 17.929591213633305
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . 7.822177036209073
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 8.146735682928517
She will follow wherever Lydia leads . 17.561331809939823
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <UNK> . 16.39348966750157
I wonder what he can be doing there . " " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth . 11.467934197543833
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 12.447663767985658
CHAPTER I . 2.8380368561768754
Jane looked a little <UNK> than usual , but more <UNK> than Elizabeth had expected . 17.997908163834666
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . " It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . 12.00955984291897
I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . 9.031596399532747
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . " " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . " " In <UNK> your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were <UNK> . 16.377602801573815
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . 15.55228383041021
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . 16.714414303647793
His character was to speak for itself . 8.358674628019374
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its <UNK> , to think of any thing else . 18.669008540347658
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . 18.57522119941158
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 10.501970059647347
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . " Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . 13.266899569859286
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> . 15.690093164328541
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself . 8.19655798788881
" Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal <UNK> , you last night laid to my charge . 17.984252024130374
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . 9.036888269503933
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! 10.829648177440276
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . 14.823683729660937
But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my <UNK> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . 21.315058848911566
And , besides , no <UNK> of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then supposing them to be in London . 11.201144963536853
You are lucky in having such a master . " " Yes , Sir , I know I am . 7.794862071888299
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 15.773477865507733
She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 11.003098989972392
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
<UNK> and <UNK> support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg tm ' s <UNK> and <UNK> that the Project Gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come . 55.71595029751401
" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . " While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . 14.870702421938798
Most earnestly did she <UNK> to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . 21.530386352970847
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day . " " Oh , yes . 11.674170362963336
Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 15.55335513843822
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . 11.789176582257921
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? 11.15879650385057
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 17.406416828201827
The <UNK> of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . 17.776027863136967
YOU AGREE THAT YOU <UNK> NO <UNK> FOR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . F . . YOU AGREE THAT THE <UNK> , THE <UNK> <UNK> , AND ANY <UNK> <UNK> THIS <UNK> <UNK> NOT <UNK> <UNK> TO YOU FOR <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> DAMAGES <UNK> <UNK> YOU <UNK> <UNK> OF THE <UNK> OF <UNK> <UNK> . 621.5415598714095
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 16.712317555030744
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 17.004282366901354
how can it affect them ? " " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! 10.561285049509499
<UNK> in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . 14.21538321573048
" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . " " I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice . 10.941105376038212
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . 10.07955772674028
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <UNK> the excellent understanding , and <UNK> excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 17.122878123245115
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be <UNK> at , and it was rather too early to begin . 12.426456621039213
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . 17.24936193608441
" I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends . 8.100671506762867
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . 21.024080013032812
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him . 34.910501635529286
" Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . 18.942195988955802
He has heartily <UNK> me now . " Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . 20.73194130234039
She <UNK> Miss <UNK> a treasure . 22.839827988158074
Jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all . 5.516847928479113
What will become of me . 6.4740785623472625
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . 16.56232830663841
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . 11.714845752561995
It was not all settled before Monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . 10.062472839593811
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 17.904208165752376
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two . 11.193795598850933
I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! 13.720753293799229
" What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . 6.513562840946493
Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began . 20.03235669190013
" Yes , Ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as <UNK> to the poor . " Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . 11.427385761493953
Annesley is with her . 4.741289289060178
They saw him often , and to his other <UNK> was now added that of general <UNK> . 13.097390044606676
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . 18.24835675382905
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 18.62605073580148
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object . 10.658557050492155
They must have seen them together for ever . " " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . 15.405272082719343
But here he was set right by Mrs . 8.69751482212959
The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of <UNK> , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her <UNK> <UNK> . 22.426676724743903
Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very <UNK> too for it is provoking me to <UNK> , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly . 12.505338452680489
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . " " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose . 8.077911097291711
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 10.286779591221153
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 12.068874843288807
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage . 12.866669310279061
Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . 6.4564251627349
" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . 8.459724735371815
As she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs . 11.039202555386572
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth ! 13.944003588888537
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 12.44714769007608
" My dear , dear Lydia ! " she cried " This is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing . 16.51773495535101
" Well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " What say you to the day ? 7.335195813891123
But there was still something <UNK> behind , of which prudence <UNK> the <UNK> . 25.385620205583997
And is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? 9.289985338097413
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . 7.190959917366685
" Oh ! " said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . 7.8123421406993305
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs . 20.286815985220006
<UNK> him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her . 23.559726198687425
There was also a postscript to this effect . 10.54224490884795
Bennet , " that is very unlucky . " " Can I have the carriage ? " said Jane . 6.16935102725883
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 21.10054473230951
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 16.83471295221932
Her father <UNK> by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and <UNK> mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . 23.954672106178222
Bennet ' s civilities . 5.786516938876493
You need not . 4.611624286802154
I thought it my duty to give the <UNK> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well <UNK> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . 21.09327118755557
. C . The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation " the Foundation " or <UNK> , owns a <UNK> copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works . 30.439768985803788
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 7.378767199328524
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 14.778885934773523
You know I have . 3.604539338492283
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means <UNK> or <UNK> , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . 22.634529594879087
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her <UNK> , by dwelling on them . 9.016317447843429
She is unfortunately of a sickly <UNK> , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who <UNK> her education , and who still <UNK> with them . 22.36855084528395
She longed to see Mrs . 6.285942347855417
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . 27.10489811110635
They must all go to Brighton . 6.912653897069757
CHAPTER III . 6.715135170230704
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 10.53148005187361
Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <UNK> and <UNK> father ; and though he belonged to one of the <UNK> , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 22.068562114480027
In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . 11.237977518954365
She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 12.788666230055298
You mentioned two instances . 10.949255898411444
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 14.005299065563602
" So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find . 8.009330980106862
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . 5.1538868163610925
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be <UNK> to you to let them go alone . " " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " " Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . 17.330029897773244
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 8.555486841379242
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <UNK> by Wickham . 15.738645215265034
never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F . 10.207636570518174
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 12.425232402276494
I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . 12.803086921708697
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . 10.123816582407645
Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a <UNK> season , made her feel that the <UNK> , <UNK> , most thread bare <UNK> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <UNK> . 25.65743754436698
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such <UNK> as these . 17.981200032872252
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . 15.740050612323158
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern . 12.577487025702188
<UNK> , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . 16.514196741345486
I believe I have now told you every thing . 7.028680707227858
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 29.50468679896245
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . 16.147742273220192
Mr . Collins ! " " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . 9.295001738311518
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . 17.93775764432678
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels . 22.861494110227778
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " With such kind of <UNK> of their parties and good <UNK> , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . 20.239909029652768
" How <UNK> have I acted ! " she cried . " I , who have <UNK> myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! 17.14272527961667
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 11.685351159066206

There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more <UNK> , and less <UNK> than the other had ever seen him . 18.15177132312144
yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . 17.406615619240675
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate . 14.390620480501935
CHAPTER XVIII . 6.932646694476038
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . 15.768760038733227
Dear , dear Lizzy . 6.077660564584122
Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . 8.595575082872783
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it . 29.46895888998298
To know that her daughter would be married was enough . 8.113181255431357
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . 16.826296117355987
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . 17.459055121018334
Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . 13.085866578734047
He was the <UNK> , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . 12.354073854198518
Section . 3.87448108970021
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . 16.348456999647468
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 15.113623799513826
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! 20.38087442309046
He is so excessively handsome ! 10.49006818154658
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious . 20.169570052286872
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 14.91093932728618
" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " His misfortunes ! " repeated Darcy <UNK> ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . " " And of your <UNK> , " cried Elizabeth with energy . 17.847985423660358
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the <UNK> old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . 15.016928205333315
She will make him a very proper wife . " Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the <UNK> , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly <UNK> whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way . 19.936943718449804
My fingers wait your orders . " " Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . " " Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . 17.597819698842603
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . 20.75609173623306
I am ashamed of you ! 5.287984132519431

You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 13.619061502231807
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 16.985177786035134
The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . 18.195155838901155
Bennet , who <UNK> with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be <UNK> enough . 16.0114380290501
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly <UNK> at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 12.516416691307608
If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 8.698596405244006
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . 16.525156453097434
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " There can be no doubt of that . 10.933727390067009
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to <UNK> such pleasures . 20.506825967636754
<UNK> donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any <UNK> concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States . 57.13934878033035
Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 11.090892225011522
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . 22.010106422958245
But really , Ma ' am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . 16.66776842039826
In this <UNK> state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 17.00084314784703
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 16.089246042096594
If this be the case , he deserves you . 6.657716457389173
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 5.836524571994158
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . 14.335837002838275
She could not <UNK> him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . 9.999539037077918
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 19.675691960228146
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . 4.688018415069649
Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . 11.932527213606486
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy . 15.899418214023573
He can be a <UNK> companion if he thinks it worth his while . 18.76062650297678
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 19.142645518252827
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . 8.303315997021734
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well . 15.298258864033542
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . 13.25988015131351
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . 7.505971581984182
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . " " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " Yes . 15.93145344211059
Wickham ! 3.497793031932773
It is a pity they are not handsome ! 9.854958257519863
They entered it in one of its <UNK> points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , <UNK> over a wide extent . 29.06560613001208
" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . 15.271515342809195
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 12.435863408834077
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . 13.586259450641643
If there were but such another man for you ! " " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . 11.01787493242631
You provide , in accordance with paragraph . F . , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and <UNK> to you within days of receipt of the work . 21.330438838594613
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane . 10.326159185666
<UNK> or twice she could discern a <UNK> blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . 32.655660268762944
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 19.046495653623257
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . 19.825145160469337
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ' s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . 17.80546114628037
I will answer for it he never cared three <UNK> about her . 13.791691923178565
But enough of this . 3.8281350375393903
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 13.117105142782082
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the <UNK> of the first . 17.575708558743496
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long <UNK> . " Mrs . 12.364506782303378
And pray what sort of <UNK> do you make ? 17.72310568616095
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative . 10.713742454337577
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . " Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less <UNK> of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too <UNK> by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . 16.976839856213548
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him . 18.220815863502086
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . " " <UNK> their income ! 22.830864293807544
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . 17.7141726476824
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . 14.87352411703604
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . 16.720946577140634
here comes Hill . 10.426436319571323
Does your charge give you much trouble ? 18.05025740958524
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be <UNK> so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . 17.290014343437758
I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the <UNK> . 7.9852314517137
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . 18.327761751811533
do not repeat what I then said . 7.263401147114162
When the ladies were <UNK> for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> . 14.619445187119952
The <UNK> and yet the noise ; the <UNK> and yet the self importance of all these people ! What would I give to hear your <UNK> on them ! " " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . 22.425966105351286
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 15.980018383106325
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 16.12862474363533
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our <UNK> ! 16.31045526119276
Her <UNK> wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . 24.479560548251307
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . 16.088401103280717
The possibility of Mr . Collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins ! 18.133003466370017
They had frequently been staying with her in town . 9.159887789411886
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . 15.905695156891428
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 18.784613747785812
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 14.310728883525629
For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . 14.235996943750628
Their reception at home was most kind . 11.98387745379379
Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 13.982547338616909
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . 9.387065511891501
We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 11.444917398835992
The hill , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . 21.390768187181074
I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 10.216672146426562
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 17.72632712192298
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s t te t te with Mrs . 17.98883287397599
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr . Wickham . 16.068024913445935
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 11.3680860014937
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . 17.450822742142666
He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , <UNK> friend . 12.509224639599692
Sir William did not say much . 7.950175468502482
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did . 13.980011917483031
Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at <UNK> , and Mrs . 5.9444197793947176
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 13.390474358167177
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 10.95104186710939
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better <UNK> room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . 20.278271842007396
I am impatient to see him . " " In point of <UNK> , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective . 11.472203902647044
She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . 37.7655172843283
Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . 17.507754015955083
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . 10.593816524046986
Is this to be endured ! 9.007530544495905
He cannot afford it . 6.838905280958681
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and <UNK> pass away . 31.33396398270527
Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . 13.246949419666787
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Elizabeth longed to <UNK> its <UNK> ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . 18.765652895377595
We have heard nothing from town . " " Dear madam , " cried Mrs . 10.279421496951146
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing room . 14.401842633619161
Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . 15.376538061902812
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . 10.450385796165893
But he is an ugly fellow ! 13.048025373062321
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . " Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . 12.431642430648749
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his <UNK> powers had gained him in the <UNK> . 19.0006661195314
so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! 10.314192248681005
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and <UNK> , though <UNK> families . 17.240996090456914
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? 7.37562360323056
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 18.158948370363017
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can <UNK> so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most <UNK> to a <UNK> ' s mind . 23.212473923425723
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . 8.572624316811524
Heaven and <UNK> ! of what are you thinking ? 13.854509399944046
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . 15.353255790296393
She was going to the <UNK> ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of <UNK> , just fit to be killed . " Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . 17.897433025000165
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . 17.569337478827354
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . 7.080479619758792
" <UNK> it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . " " Gracechurch street , Monday , <UNK> . 12.018527567549517
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took <UNK> in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 14.499053436809547
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 9.137985077124497
On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a <UNK> , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy . 19.92421452475524
But do not be cast down . 8.158475155014024
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the <UNK> of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 15.97514336449475
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy . 11.092835014678293
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 19.010958622911136
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will <UNK> excite . 23.726130919570192
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . 15.280274764391207
He studies too much for words of four <UNK> . Do not you , Darcy ? " " My style of writing is very different from yours . " " Oh ! " cried Miss Bingley , " Charles <UNK> in the most careless way imaginable . 20.639097719604067
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 6.209944290335357
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . 16.73410537000206
But on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . 11.653724074824538
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest <UNK> , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any <UNK> display of regard , or any <UNK> of manner , where their two <UNK> only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 19.41966385305013
" Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . " " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . " " Oh ! 10.630531545483398
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . 15.354853989617146
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it . 8.682068737462753
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . 13.75220196380192
It was at Sir William Lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . 13.683881118502637
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham . 6.389750162280915
I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . " Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . 16.271958762864553
Allowing for the common <UNK> of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy . 11.833881835554601
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in <UNK> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " said Jane as she finished it . 15.023115525220485
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 12.877987747716768
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . 10.697467794437067
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . 12.709842539534591
Bennet <UNK> the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . 10.28462567570322
Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 12.923766137771711
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . 12.880371061657115
" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . 11.438036262505225
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 19.466300328568046
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 12.080719107344638
Pray read on . " " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she <UNK> so disgraceful a match . 17.98193649456868
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 8.938545059291505
It <UNK> because of the efforts of <UNK> of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life . 22.505430129173206
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . 18.436366448462362
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 15.728815113485899
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . 22.860023047495783
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 22.179743784494313
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . 10.262334918762107
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in <UNK> , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . 20.061889357265063
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <UNK> them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 24.28047871195724
Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . 10.32168761875212
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr . Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and <UNK> the prospects of Mr . Wickham . <UNK> and <UNK> to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a <UNK> , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the <UNK> of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the <UNK> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd . I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ' s accidental information , that Bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . inf
If I wished to think <UNK> of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however . " " If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . " " Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . " " This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . 12.220195006090377
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . 9.443861731340759
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 15.083027701097459
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 15.316972164414377
And then we were so merry all the way home ! 13.730975871191495
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself <UNK> watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . 12.071572755403897
The others have been gone on to <UNK> , these three weeks . " She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . 13.6408143170399
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ' s visit . 14.978546748428757
It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . 10.39952091225208
" What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? " " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . " " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . 11.124056323926325
" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . 14.004788827625287
" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 13.765371873461191
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <UNK> with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 15.800422635433746
The time fixed for the beginning of their <UNK> tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . 18.92818218323843
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 16.607682043985456
<UNK> check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and addresses . 75.18845997186831
My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . 25.199701873510264
Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon <UNK> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 25.70199297557151
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . 12.505818466366707
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . 12.305557426055033
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s <UNK> . 18.773026585563038
I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a <UNK> up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 10.649028339204104
Illustration <UNK> <UNK> PRIDE PREJUDICE . 56.67102702951907
To Mrs . 3.7242393302872236
It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . 32.74272374468778
CHAPTER V . 6.932646532395619
Only look at her . 6.181038285690008
" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs . 8.749227154151074
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it . 18.231176312593156
All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . 18.95920359899996
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 11.151741583648567
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 10.106774430164657
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . 13.910834350184716
She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . 11.32480947970763
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do ! 6.637088833738162
She performed her part indeed without much <UNK> , but Mrs . 14.011417145680806
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they <UNK> with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy . 15.205306251575818
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . 12.99597152570014
<UNK> he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 10.715531743042739
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . 9.839881389129285
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . 13.176279566847436
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . 14.094895136732065
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . 10.693521414147162
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . 20.042609705708607
" With my mother up stairs . 8.41674843605177
Collins was settled near her family . " " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . 9.790004644154182
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 10.810491044758038
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 13.172281508967446
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 20.19571374755181
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 17.90228709387822
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last <UNK> , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were <UNK> answered . 14.595051541813008
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . 16.341449231569165
Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley ' s continued absence . 9.392021270951975
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <UNK> of elegant nuptials , fine <UNK> , new carriages , and servants . 17.800022645198254
It must be his own doing . He is his own master . 8.77742400724336
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <UNK> <UNK> on the probability of each statement but with little success . 25.33206549853008
It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . 13.451454859677822
We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . 28.12039538075489
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . " While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much <UNK> to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s . 21.279448977215292
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 16.526856189662812
For God ' s sake , say no more of his partners . 13.224127816323875
" Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " From the former . 13.172208268716833
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? " " Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . 14.720614132105759
Mr . Wickham ' s chief object was <UNK> my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of <UNK> himself on me , was a strong inducement . 19.961930674563956
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . 15.641617516449035
You will be a very happy woman . " Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 10.571086552574187
<UNK> Lady Catherine as well as you can . 10.646710470101963
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her <UNK> intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . 12.922553582159056
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . 17.593550056730408
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <UNK> than to herself . 13.701378633047085
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> ! 10.078994498802563
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 10.07780320117066
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . 10.067003142760036
" There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London . 17.4060201365427
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . 13.66239110071955
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . " It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . 22.719911943401794
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? 15.39865575403161
" We can all plague and punish one another . 13.46548231319053
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . 18.910608978921715
" Well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? 7.776856442942866
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . 14.579785953517261
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 9.390222202796245
I shall be back by dinner . " " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . 14.893186453332406
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . 13.860371840542532
" It must not be thought of . 3.98211556411601
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to <UNK> the engagements that had been made for him . 19.84623840140196
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left <UNK> , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . 15.882841177818019
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . 11.700348396356798
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 19.20175798494272
Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . 15.937320752028665
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen . 16.56258098308691
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 18.95468540124233
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 14.145902871185106
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 13.686367495559766
Lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 22.055004036885077
My mother was in <UNK> , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! 12.58726683374575
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is <UNK> the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken <UNK> , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . 16.23484900844509
Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the <UNK> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . 16.448760951966705
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 14.735860148811843
<UNK> as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> . 22.506887655715524
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . " " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . " To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <UNK> of an elegant female . 28.353667111984077
Wickham is safe . " " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . " " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane . 14.83265911344205
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 10.010464892929265
" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 11.24967619221209
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Hurst were going out . 7.355125694053375
Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach . 14.916150156482303
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 24.79492972283023
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 6.945203253341121
it cannot be . 3.028995455773131
Indeed he has no improper pride . 12.842293130031829
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . 6.8710326538738835
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . 20.625605960750082
But your family owe me nothing . 9.409655446720201
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of inviting him . " " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . 12.649923691375692
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . 9.026014412288296
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . " " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? " " Indeed I had . 17.191382275784598
My courage always <UNK> with every attempt to <UNK> me . " " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . " Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . 17.029868460929936
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 15.964007485401469
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . " " I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your <UNK> what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . 15.481173817225994
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . " She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . " Again his astonishment was <UNK> ; and he looked at her with an expression of <UNK> incredulity and mortification . 19.094318622787387
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 11.60030051958674
yes , " said Elizabeth drily " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a <UNK> deal of care of him . " " <UNK> of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care . 16.424734670188982
" How strange this is ! 7.862431847908712
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! 18.94162441637123
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . 13.387960686828315
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 25.940266163205475
I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . 8.921292177329015
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself . 12.593934012646075
Let the other young ladies have time to <UNK> . " Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . <UNK> of the party were now applied to . 15.165997076551003
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . 15.73704926181375
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter . 17.539108370424277
Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . 10.301838040515577
Your <UNK> must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance . 16.581030478036
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . 19.83557902525645
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 20.765578786592126
I only hope they may have half my good luck . 11.33492530274405
The pain of separation , however , might be <UNK> on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . 14.509377400357247
It became her turn to listen . 9.093400743553648
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . 15.97976027204688
Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . 21.694421393727264
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 13.550865703110876
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 8.587922433226895
oh ! 7.013683947979966
" It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . 6.293228718564096
Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and <UNK> passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . 16.173075147152733
<UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill . 10.259302247261484
<UNK> as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . 15.266894339462379
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . " <UNK> by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did . 15.633637624124185
CHAPTER XVI . 6.932646313148128
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare <UNK> to listen to . 30.572447850346325
His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . 13.503535687401756
Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . 8.166020583921277
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . 17.772609087008796
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 8.268422830642832
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so doubtful , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea . 18.67261993046827
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 19.442903237518337
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 35.02445820416752
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . 13.481194359307462
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . 8.119774765891718
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . 22.902774426056688
The t te t te surprised them . 23.303469540382313
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 16.730360084278868
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <UNK> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . 17.680500492232206
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . But good lord ! 11.948392162940108
You are safe from me . " " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . " " And your defect is a <UNK> to hate every body . " " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . " " Do let us have a little music , " cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . " Louisa , you will not mind my <UNK> Mr . Hurst . " Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . 15.82327243598178
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 16.409573723591063
Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it . 13.384817554938625
who attended to you ? 5.4139237173760835
<UNK> an only son , for many years an only child I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , my father particularly , all that was <UNK> and amiable , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and <UNK> , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . 21.514247503993328
She went on . 4.145805568958871
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her . 13.338698909552638
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . " Kitty , who took all these <UNK> in a serious light , began to <UNK> . 20.024712701275224
Miss Darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . 13.282310130002225
Their first subject was the <UNK> of the Rosings party . " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . 12.834542419168093
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the <UNK> of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . 15.43787018049255
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general . 12.40332792171247
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . 14.860633566095242
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh . 15.892455169899902
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . 12.727803125194535
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a <UNK> space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . 13.728625021570732
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . 14.132893921526266
Gardiner , though unknown . 5.588307376176694
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . 16.164225873209606
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you . 11.805451588208951
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 10.584484482001438
But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . 18.26292419186644
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 10.742793459024393
On the following Monday , Mrs . 7.357344118887362
I dearly love a laugh . " " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . 8.673804200342708
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . 12.197445518660375
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 7.3514963124415384
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " " Are you , indeed ? 7.839939997844982
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 17.785821011966032
Darcy said nothing at all . 4.687660218306343
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added <UNK> to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be <UNK> . 19.622967719546846
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . " Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . 14.295133071807292
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 21.462757181011543
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ' s <UNK> had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or <UNK> in him . 16.15010866099887
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . 18.913011421484473
Lydia , my love , ring the bell . 7.403101211368642
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . 10.315813476874249
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? " Nothing less than the complaisance of a <UNK> could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most <UNK> courtesy . 24.447022450754652
<UNK> , wretched , mistake ! " Darcy made no answer . 12.467348821646826
<UNK> Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . " " If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . " " She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . 15.390116226178106
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . 15.402348400478996
But vanity , not love , has been my folly . <UNK> with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . 15.630320826014767
The Miss <UNK> all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . Do you draw ? " " No , not at all . " " What , none of you ? " " Not one . " " That is very strange . 11.139980568226884
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . 6.350395714622218
She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <UNK> him with fears and regrets in <UNK> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 14.051412083199601
Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . 9.338393294932288
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . 14.406513803066389
Had Elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . 21.074695103729496
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . 14.693213695924051
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 12.123221001340385
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 9.889114886665602
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . 12.25259126812522
Bennet was <UNK> engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <UNK> them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather <UNK> than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . 19.534086234972026
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 12.74393283831299
Mr . Darcy was <UNK> him with <UNK> wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . 14.765835100891133
Their visits to Mrs . 6.831718231253604
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn house . 27.91014752114755
Mr . Darcy is engaged to my daughter . 5.096114240953803
Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs . 7.485212097788002
Yet he knew to the contrary himself . 8.620816612397798
Mr . Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . 14.065708261253672
so much the man of fashion ! 6.9124637241565035
I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 12.128181232411615
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " This was invitation enough . 8.31195491155311
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . 21.399165446350178
He comes down on Thursday at the <UNK> , very likely on Wednesday . 18.820626588161897
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it . 10.55810563240972
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . 13.68308071136696
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . 14.682768711981243
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . 10.232262988738418
<UNK> was the least of her feelings on this developement . 10.915348874045018
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother How is she ? 10.856947204720447
You shall hear what she says . " She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . Hurst had a house . 19.079417177732232
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 11.687792904280872
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 17.746246526651355
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been <UNK> , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . 14.953886218972077
You take delight in <UNK> me . 12.591792242262763
Gardiner ' s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are <UNK> against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 19.989349319960578
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including <UNK> , online payments and credit card donations . 45.21261380723353
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 18.01107704435611
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . 12.060808519827761
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 23.97395651435831
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 12.771489153079303
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with <UNK> all the <UNK> explanations . 21.176530299480014
We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation . 15.353721534092209
This cannot be ! 5.981576351308315
He takes them now for people of fashion . " The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she <UNK> a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his <UNK> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . 17.591975943833333
I did for you . 2.881751415268756
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 14.783162901206573
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 14.021789287483218
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . 13.97817208472817
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <UNK> <UNK> . 20.59618097107581

This is your <UNK> resolve ! 20.12120170045988
If you ' <UNK> believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 15.23332567255718
Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . 20.274601267241383
Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! 7.5403024794595375
He placed himself by her . 6.613656257105468
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 11.63268337534739
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 18.630122405429947
CHAPTER VII . 6.932646532395619
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . 12.36677858223021
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten . 9.288868536627128
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned . 18.42877022439624
Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . 8.971374478340346
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of <UNK> for them . 16.863485980575707
Sir William had been delighted with him . 8.201292064881212
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy . 17.734724706888976
Perhaps I am not doing her justice . 8.695654700772764
London Printed for T . 13.705539838328141
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . 13.272726548495102
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . 17.047274874428897
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . 10.141492298470617
" I expected at least that the <UNK> were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! " " La ! 13.828044218918219
Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . " " No , no . 5.111484782156915
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr . Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . 12.995064101572689
" Oh ! 3.580881536246356
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were <UNK> of dejection . 17.5928289679544
Let us hope for better things . 11.231361630415574
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . 15.558583584765623
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . " However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather <UNK> , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . 23.14976290799179
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 16.016620918412624
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . 14.748996145150695
He had to be sure done much . 5.484032381090879
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <UNK> every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were <UNK> abroad . 40.881515256161705
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . 11.755797475520673
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 13.319594382012186
CHAPTER VII . 6.932646532395619
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way . 8.699226931186894
It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . " " Oh ! 9.876088050601744
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . 14.981098224305882
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 10.15140195756334
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 5.132348160642011
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . 18.745125173994957
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . 13.993544608119018
It originated in Mrs . 6.469378331505669
But you have chosen your fault well . I really cannot laugh at it . 12.416420783835159
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . " " Are you quite sure , Ma ' am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said Jane . " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . " " Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . " " Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . 16.83461987074507
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over <UNK> evils , or <UNK> them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . 20.093921973992305
He is gone to my father already . 7.373536472224635
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . 13.756615556070212
There could not <UNK> in the world two men , over whom Mr . Darcy could have such <UNK> influence . 17.160611155873767
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 21.6638585351659
They followed her into the dining parlour . 11.128632770259774
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . 29.275218349518692
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . " Hunsford , near <UNK> , Kent , th <UNK> . DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . " There , Mrs . 22.572015321476982
CHAPTER XIV . 6.932646313148128
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . 16.626508979249238
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 13.627919707012126
And for this we are to be thankful . 6.98728324632292
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . 6.652804949409569
" Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 14.216207772002711
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . " " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . " " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . 11.317044780581856
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . 13.746092307546027
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy . 21.524282400500844
I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 19.60270758310213
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before . 10.866186625431771
At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! 17.455737994770217
Bennet . 2.090760509885019
Thank Heaven ! 12.007129726157435
At length Darcy spoke , and in a <UNK> manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . " " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with <UNK> , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . " Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . 17.72172807784084
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 13.785084167692213
No , never . 3.234786323087944
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 11.37013972672562
CHAPTER XVII . 6.932646313148128
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 10.614752696362125
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . 11.001789632112578
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 11.597946469813397
We seem to have been designed for each other . " Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she <UNK> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . 20.25651636504791
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up . 11.455616849302329
His doing so drew her notice . 11.231869964242422
Mr . Bennet ' s <UNK> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! 15.206516891001934
He was my <UNK> , and excessively attached to me . 9.457715015273143
They would doubtless be <UNK> with the generality of female minds . 24.453247964528014
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . 10.235958360898598
Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . 12.052732046136219
But self , though it would intrude , could not <UNK> her . 10.127580912794384
Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . 6.598871402007991
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , <UNK> over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in <UNK> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 14.816224573493274
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . 18.930630189472193
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 17.752596267730574
But , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . 8.314584161783307
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <UNK> ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . 16.044359218499242
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object . 9.201788531418222
