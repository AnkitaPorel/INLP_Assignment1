Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise . 422.58016700329716
<UNK> of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . " Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready <UNK> . 2292.5618595272863
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 856.0930392179147
His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . 1492.7201112314328
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 2009.9870812003999
CHAPTER XII . 237.11669479662504
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 1893.9573730208906
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . 1517.421539571126
Your ' s , c . 320.82644539138596
<UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . 2033.026156897375
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s <UNK> . 1555.4198496585682
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . 1864.0301225187463
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
She is grown so <UNK> and <UNK> ! 1089.1687844225426
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others . 2150.8318640725074
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . 1211.423720005617
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 2212.8247500596613
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 1143.6799391287605
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 1764.2928545234795
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . 1959.2480584601888
" John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? " " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 1266.5270899465536
Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by <UNK> to his sister . 1258.7088628230988
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 974.2634413536042
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 1214.91893205464
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 1733.1757689691756
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them . 1094.4650326895376
Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> . 2361.1002900691574
There is no indignity so <UNK> to their feelings ! " She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " " And quite alone ? 1621.836771945587
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . 1899.7608742364578
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <UNK> , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . 1673.8495299964177
Gardiner was so little to be trusted . " " You must not blame my aunt . 924.720092760522
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . 1930.8968554528826
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious . 2375.8775698088743
He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would <UNK> more birds on the first of <UNK> , than any body else in the country . 1473.8354292415165
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . 2016.3445879757287
Every thing , however , went on <UNK> , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ' s first sketch . 1495.3848120373943
Let the other young ladies have time to <UNK> . " Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . <UNK> of the party were now applied to . 2386.3071192594316
Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . " " No , no . 586.9670049688037
" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But now we may be silent . " " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " Sometimes . 2046.8058727730638
I know no harm of her . " " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her <UNK> ' s death made her mistress of this fortune . " " No why should he ? 1394.843746951034
It is Mr . Bingley I am sure . 306.5869646508245
Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the <UNK> and smiles of the whole party . 1396.9617660217575
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . 1469.686430340808
She had also to <UNK> how her visit would pass , the quiet <UNK> of their usual employments , the vexatious <UNK> of Mr . Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings . 1696.2728521865854
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her <UNK> you . " Mrs . 873.037613235152
Its <UNK> depended on others . 1160.8206689020649
Nor was Darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 1712.0863756749634
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 806.9030382123244
Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ? 1991.4319100305136
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . " Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative . 1561.5178817035398
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . 1076.657010336687
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 2378.330494013831
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . 1795.5786019240445
I had no notion but he would go a <UNK> , or something or other , and not <UNK> us with his company . 1755.3124920010644
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , <UNK> painful to me . 1787.4952450790747
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 1980.1140830279571
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 1572.7185151527601
" He only told me , what I have now told you . " Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart <UNK> with indignation . 1239.3318862306778
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way . 1523.9770814638598
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? 2146.6669465262767
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 1260.0134305356348
She was ashamed to think how much . 506.9817633073936
They agreed that Mrs . 245.27013550695602
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy . 1012.452751561843
Jane was distressed . 355.5296729432972
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 1843.4358379491555
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry . 1762.1079621307658
" A man who has once been refused ! 816.8107777224471
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr . Darcy . She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! Yet it did , and even a third . 2525.106968930331
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . 1940.0341641301197
" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? 1118.6322894374177
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <UNK> at the <UNK> of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time <UNK> her natural degree of sense , since the <UNK> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be <UNK> , was likely to be <UNK> in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a <UNK> place and a camp . 3165.2227151891257
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified . 1288.3468740802903
" I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the <UNK> and public places . 1699.186665195732
single , my dear , to be sure ! 594.514639084024
Lady Catherine was <UNK> proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her . 1432.4776103055879
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " <UNK> so I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . 1479.3903912250992
Our poor mother is sadly grieved . 1183.8217284233147
Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other . 1093.3004599264254
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 1871.5800886418917
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a <UNK> denial , and ride off as fast as I could . " " Would Mr . Darcy then consider the <UNK> of your original intention as <UNK> for by your obstinacy in <UNK> to it ? " " Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . " " You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . 2133.3913636807133
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 1216.793811896527
He leaves out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <UNK> . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must <UNK> reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility . 1444.486496307795
Well ! 264.37723983920523
But , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 1010.8071074294195
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . 1748.9456616019284
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs . 1192.688042157868
What could be more natural than his asking you again ? 1244.5522999290886
But Georgiana would not join her . 551.0139161659123
" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " His misfortunes ! " repeated Darcy <UNK> ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . " " And of your <UNK> , " cried Elizabeth with energy . 1840.5192230366058
" You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . 660.7807738407363
It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 1640.29252399713
No one but Mrs . 284.2839149133708

Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . 1463.8491861746745
Her affections had been continually <UNK> , but never without an object . 1602.1667170913656
" You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice . 896.0388397794364
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <UNK> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 2156.049348944278
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . 1195.6094259453946
Gardiner smiled . 306.15256836937846
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the <UNK> of red <UNK> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 2018.2963507121433
F . 284.0918539513759
<UNK> check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and addresses . 2488.691644661238
" She is my youngest girl but one . 684.4129031862113
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 2047.2684360231392
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . 789.9579302973405
How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr . Bingley ? " " Not at all . " " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . 1089.4664546185443
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 1822.299973501392
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 1220.100172664963
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . 1392.3530543704924
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <UNK> <UNK> her there . 1851.0664892185525
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . 1776.2993216770092
here comes Hill . 844.9337769639616
Wickham is safe . " " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . " " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane . 1286.2286797598433
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? " A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and <UNK> and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . 2263.122715153971
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be <UNK> at , and it was rather too early to begin . 1500.5366428335694
But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . 342.74565000355204
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Philips were now <UNK> of the most interesting intelligence . 1449.9520245584308
On entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . 2276.715424093333
Have you seen any pleasant men ? 1102.1154214628436
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . 1054.6745747321193
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . 1614.801886295262
Sir William had been delighted with him . 662.7432990844161
Bennet with civil self command to Miss Lucas . 820.7394376367002
Lakes , mountains , and <UNK> , shall not be <UNK> together in our <UNK> ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . 3127.5096171070363
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time . 2148.1766467623092
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 1102.0372634985486
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did . 1417.9788838117981
Teaze him laugh at him . <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . " " But upon my honour I do not . 1299.7221836395586
Such a disappointment ! 538.2344694015114
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there . 1561.7159814536585
" It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . 369.14444987361907
Dear , dear Lizzy . 802.7268231788072
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . 1269.455705209746
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 2447.9466828607997
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . The possibility of his having really endured such <UNK> , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained . 2020.389956928879
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her . 1474.280882561669
How odious I should think them ! " " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " " I am afraid you do not like your pen . 1228.1942439166714
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . " " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . " Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . 1215.8418926015115
The discussion of Mr . Collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . 1382.098797304453
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . 2169.0433222401884
Elizabeth , <UNK> all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . 2097.9784865775523
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> . 1568.7505847184536
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph . 1501.26919656068
This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better . 1428.6904722365161
You are not well enough ; you cannot go yourself . " Elizabeth hesitated , but her <UNK> <UNK> under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . 1729.4003769064477
CHAPTER VII . 251.15965623927994
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s <UNK> her coming so far alone . 2269.7582086370385
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side . 2278.764085323064
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . 1548.9973218322082
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . 1633.6558968259626
They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . " " <UNK> a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . 2183.4340690376644
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 1610.112439447809
They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . 2110.886410664554
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 2028.5728431849186
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <UNK> have alarmed her . 1646.8381583468104
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . 1305.006516462599
The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 1501.7571560592926
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <UNK> <UNK> necessary . 1909.742789841358
But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . 2036.2796286968378
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . 2408.7692144993543
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only <UNK> off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . " When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . 2675.929778080505
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . 1958.414381911513
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 1038.5154659831153
I am not at all afraid of her dying . 580.9391264711393
If the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the <UNK> . 2180.429626330918
If your feelings are still what they were last <UNK> , tell me so at once . 1628.4062525845811
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 1896.0227770824697
but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley ' s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the <UNK> have no horses to theirs . " " I had much rather go in the coach . " " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure . 1200.9669355047852
From what can it proceed ? 874.0641170500685
Dear me ! 481.26055453746426
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , Mrs . 1062.7877696622145
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 1800.0375058996415
" And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . 688.1090892218728
In spite of her deeply <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger . 2091.625898816126
Hurst ' s gown " Here she was interrupted again . 1285.6554491450638
Her hair so <UNK> , so <UNK> ! " " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six <UNK> deep in <UNK> , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . " " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . 1899.9669650806375
They were in street . 359.83253174231726
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 1625.8550700430856
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 1453.170654054097
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing room . 1344.3257155806775
At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . " With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 2368.7052122076057
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with <UNK> civility , " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ? 1990.9750848488457
Bennet was <UNK> engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <UNK> them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather <UNK> than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . 2015.4090248249433
" I am all astonishment . 244.038766107307
She had high <UNK> spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . 1809.9374350759997
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . 1102.7798331386966
It would be dreadful ! 423.21027901263824
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! 755.0219641106556
<UNK> , stay , I will go myself . 1376.996070870436
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . " " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 1618.039619136548
For , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken <UNK> , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the <UNK> reproof . 2509.6939197939496
<UNK> pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . 2217.6939264748576
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 1685.176441537658
Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . 997.8371052504525
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 1164.0275627348312
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 1275.586752642777
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 1801.5808001801008
I hate such false friends . 539.7024866888884
The hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . 1381.2492194990484
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some <UNK> , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . " When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister . 2017.8849690369875
The fee is owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg tm trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation . 1235.9759162655657
Mr . Darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . 298.5135133995013
Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the <UNK> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . 2074.2964612729866
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is <UNK> . " " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs . 1086.6513817602727
Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . 1517.2998835673884
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . 2646.8638576557278
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 1748.6513879264298
Elizabeth immediately began playing again . 523.4890863054975
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . 905.7706773248178
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 1419.5774533993726
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . 1021.3941593073158
CHAPTER XI . 237.11669479662504
Could there be finer symptoms ? 1052.9250155312304
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . " " Is that his design in settling here ? " " <UNK> ! 1148.3797951119498
It must be his own doing . He is his own master . 1268.86148183193
They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . 1329.1178412023846
You are not going to be <UNK> , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . 1420.2272041611163
Bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at <UNK> , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to <UNK> you when your father is dead . I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . 2078.97711890228
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . 1190.5489268503638
Her ease and good spirits increased . 910.7177013562899
I expected you to stay two months . 749.5419101461581
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> . 1935.5346551549449
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 1798.8196612210222
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . 1806.3144851464408
" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . 728.7117695169336
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs . 805.8335071962616
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had <UNK> time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 1708.377008242637
Five daughters <UNK> entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . 1198.580425905416
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <UNK> to that evening , " said Elizabeth . 1118.4443631550848
Mr . Darcy is engaged to my daughter . 352.375405137893
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . But good lord ! 778.0345837005439
Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1683.7980099262354
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . 2161.9860469446116
They crossed it by a <UNK> bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a <UNK> , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the <UNK> <UNK> wood which bordered it . 2548.93083832023
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . " " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . 989.8408129311671
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . " " Aye that is because you have the right disposition . 1438.6638009168053
In a <UNK> voice Mrs . 457.44693669137484
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled . 2070.3783230854965
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . 519.2758451904544
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> . 1736.4718409562374
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with <UNK> and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as <UNK> an air as possible . " Mr . Bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . 2260.5769409801565
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library . " Mrs . 2339.459353488823
<UNK> , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . " " And do you <UNK> it to either of those ? " " Yes ; to the last . 1636.3698241559848
After a short pause , her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me . 975.7070541676476
She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . 1478.5100298218197
it is just as he <UNK> . 1282.165219587947
He is gone to my father already . 713.1495056114198
Mr . Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . 1013.1182051795339
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , glancing at her sister and Bingley , shall take place . 1766.9542014569004
" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr . Darcy ? " " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . " " I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . 1421.5697482543844
Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . 919.9189406009218
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . " " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . 1116.062663575686
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 894.431545239541
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . 1534.547606794535
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained . 1608.3322973844624
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . " " No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me . 1253.71615740527
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . " " Oh ! 650.0201685377402
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . 1559.2881158328187
Bennet ' s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . 718.4636627727721
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . 1122.9874765234158
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done . 1706.28895698902
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . 1053.0201433372686
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 1429.9310738111035
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . 1350.1427722316707
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . 1861.2664821294118
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . 507.6857139610773
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 1461.2632813528624
His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry <UNK> , his wife may teach him . 1916.3698277884537
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 1351.7986112067722
Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon <UNK> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 2105.894048572271
Kitty , run down and order the carriage . 1219.8439681304071
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . 1258.805679996408
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago . " " I have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said Mrs . 815.5834502740013
yes I understand you perfectly . " " I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . " " That is as it happens . 1374.3142886200092
Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . 881.2748469642136
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! 799.6000823015569
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . 2240.284352533921
Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the <UNK> ? 1743.5171792375697
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . 1606.2814623030772
He was <UNK> his memory with <UNK> and noble names . 1474.1086528191518
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 1807.888296340027
you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 1696.935931104301
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . 1695.0223916658758
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . 905.6879782151716
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . 1373.4268595428503
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a <UNK> table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the <UNK> of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . 2309.188627911469
" There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London . 2125.7533810476516
CHAPTER XVI . 237.11669479662504
We passed each other several times . 971.1405851671223
Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 1503.624918906644
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . 1157.6577718292283
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . 1469.6537657429992
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the <UNK> on guard , and dressing a <UNK> and <UNK> . 2874.837619207096
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . 1251.1401918513839
and his sisters are charming women . 899.2671492616055
" I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five <UNK> any object . 1452.7488867607588
" She is so fond of Mrs . 330.46096665302326
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? 1044.2292872144285
Oh , Lydia ! " " I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 1061.6871216809532
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! 1186.3144272371342
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 1977.2908932966611
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 1881.3735078460998
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair . 1591.1377495882157
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 1692.228397869355
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s t te t te with Mrs . 1041.3341868501611
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . 1769.4963881884198
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation . 1406.4846649855342
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 2033.6931854209358
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . 2026.501330167915
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to <UNK> people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? 1699.1511182164486
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 2238.370486570401
But no such recollection <UNK> her . 598.8293774152224
Hurst began again . 388.67548473056723
You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . 920.3221222991999
When the ladies were <UNK> for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> . 1516.3049582708738
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . 1930.1957530298228
Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 1742.191197921053
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . " " Oh ! 1192.9976449986978
I have not the smallest hope . 334.1087082749349
But it must not , shall not be . 617.6018658069323
" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . 1873.369196123815
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 1909.042603093629
His words seemed to <UNK> it . 777.304507009516
" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech . 530.4979379132236
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy . 1453.7398135456501
" They are going to be <UNK> near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! 1770.248861110217
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . 915.5091602402572
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 1060.1130726913482
my dear , " continued Mrs . 257.9454065838675
" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her . 938.1957096173526
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . 1219.8166805552469
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . 1013.7740557678102
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . " She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . 1699.8004907416644
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a <UNK> of emotion they excited . 1836.2057592943138
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . 1935.3715809708847
" If they had uncles enough to <UNK> all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one <UNK> less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . 1494.7003727740648
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . 1835.3441701975946
<UNK> the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it cannot be long . " He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . 2609.8939195434523
Here , <UNK> , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . 2182.6767647704223
I am perfectly satisfied . 229.24487264727094
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . 1194.2846561050053
<UNK> , selfish girl ! 1338.57223912209
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , c . 2205.5126330821627
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
She often tried to provoke Darcy into <UNK> her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . 2339.4328657543506
my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 990.011746073849
can it be really so ! 1068.65535941113
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . " " In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . 1506.64644012604
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it . 1110.1792597805377
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . 749.8650920804109
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side . 1152.8559038874555
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 1923.9374037482582
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which were scattered over the <UNK> lawn . 2575.5234259932945
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of <UNK> them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <UNK> , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the <UNK> kind . " She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <UNK> by any feeling of <UNK> . 2684.966784930503
is she handsome ? " " She is a most charming young lady indeed . 1020.1041659501176
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . 1973.0769036355978
<UNK> sons cannot marry where they like . " " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . " " Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . " " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl ' s younger son ? 2248.5315671238973
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before . 2002.1938973572242
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . 1341.9056505324545
Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . 1578.6898833917912
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley ' s <UNK> on fine eyes . 1526.3961736536999
Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . 1031.2551145991185
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 1691.8577250059004
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <UNK> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . 1812.4764411492954
Three daughters married ! 904.1125694072941
CHAPTER I . 226.77999763369792
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? 1595.8141310785866
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation . 1511.5659168292825
The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . 1490.0332173869424
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can ' t think . 1436.7182900700348
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 1234.6552100625224
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . 2037.5401956376895
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including <UNK> , online payments and credit card donations . 2591.0998794806933
has she any family ? " " She has one only daughter , the <UNK> of Rosings , and of very extensive property . " " Ah ! " cried Mrs . 1310.5309722422317
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 1329.710184842142
My aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . " " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . 1654.78495418095
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . 1227.548546939912
" <UNK> Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at <UNK> , if the drawing room were larger ; but <UNK> is too far off ! 1771.6459866917885
But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he <UNK> that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 1341.875591188061
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . 1482.6351162491505
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London . 878.565001637741
For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . 2038.3642812237106
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . 1050.1134227072662
In that case he would return no more . 825.1600898857888
Lydia laughed , and said , " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . 1387.225110784045
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . " " My dear , you flatter me . 1501.6252453388367
<UNK> Lady Catherine as well as you can . 1327.8460345934557
You do not look well . 460.6824062804568
But I have other <UNK> . 587.2268324852764
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not . 1648.6074999652335
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . 2295.8917418677756
It was to be such a secret ! " " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject . 899.8354851825449
<UNK> an only son , for many years an only child I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , my father particularly , all that was <UNK> and amiable , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and <UNK> , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . 2704.7855884276278
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in <UNK> ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs . 2098.6680050768227
They then went away . 314.12316908425527
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . 1848.3810116305003
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . 1112.3973855115794
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! 1562.127634730328
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . 1479.0843320802844
" Don ' t keep <UNK> so , Kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! 1519.1619070186491
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . 1420.9348617765497
But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 2142.692798697848
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . 1361.4301190537274
Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . 1898.9621144284354
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 1508.843951221684
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the <UNK> , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <UNK> . 2639.5920534173065
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . " " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . 1186.0264241404445
When is your turn to come ? 809.8965976524162
That he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . 1130.1261230797293
So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 1869.6443844331457
My youngest sister has left all her friends has <UNK> ; has thrown herself into the power of of Mr . Wickham . 1468.4480154155324
But don ' t imagine it was from any silly cause . 1277.1069002131098
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? " Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . 1689.7426212431303
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 1286.8804557638116
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all <UNK> , if she <UNK> more , and could have the advantage of a London master . 1713.6849889595783
" My dear , dear Lydia ! " she cried " This is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing . 1724.1841875106243
My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . 1606.7295223363092
All Meryton seemed striving to <UNK> the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . 1992.7036015369792
Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 591.3055999093484
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . 746.6889228879492
Kitty and Lydia take his <UNK> much more to heart than I do . 1539.0504286804994
It will save me a world of trouble and economy . 1224.3032312985245
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him . 1994.0697551492756
" And this is always the way with him , " she added . " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . 1325.2201659171374
She <UNK> the days that must <UNK> before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . 1952.7331206703939
END OF THE <UNK> <UNK> . 1436.2870732652586
He cannot know what Mr . Darcy is . " " <UNK> not ; but Mr . Darcy can please where he chuses . 957.3697030925961
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . 1502.2561147005972
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled . " A gentleman and a stranger ! 934.8896530747796
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , <UNK> Lucases . 2092.628775903525
And it is the more to be <UNK> , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte <UNK> me , that this <UNK> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs . 2011.0663088247215
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth . 1141.59484386207
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . 1431.1919018193926
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " This was invitation enough . 847.9707724480345
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few <UNK> , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <UNK> . " Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 2140.968029747763
She has a very good notion of <UNK> , though her taste is not equal to Anne ' s . 1450.150516185212
Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . 1561.0534456398805
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 1377.1652572532819
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild <UNK> , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character . 1847.9523938802718
" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? " " To morrow fortnight . " " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . 795.8990745569578
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . 1030.1874663926774
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . 968.6838130884838
CHAPTER XIV . 237.11669479662504
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . 1602.6120558077914
At that moment , she cared for no other . 1025.8354590351728
You must learn some of my philosophy . 811.8147452945399
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? 1348.9674504766306
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . " " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . 1391.1429145399559
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 1111.8336864025148
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . 2166.509205920035
You are lucky in having such a master . " " Yes , Sir , I know I am . 846.4442058217039
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church . 1489.6758579281584
And what do you think she said besides ? 840.1750042894944
<UNK> those who are at all his <UNK> in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . 2334.9926383491306
" Lizzy , you must not do so . 418.7692167666842
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <UNK> , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the <UNK> way for happiness . 2187.430453663241
But with me , it is not so . 414.00939880042483
If his own vanity , however , did not <UNK> him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . 1841.6729201035278
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . 1249.0347398767826
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . 1965.1970230715694
You must not suspect me . 368.7023925398209
" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your <UNK> appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . " " Oh ! 2055.962596017864
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! 1663.9819639578632
I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . " " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . 1244.2208074505481
There is nothing else to be done . 476.60674372138806
Mr . Collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . 1500.1751570145495
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed . 2001.507301983778
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . 1055.8932777996172
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . 1027.1200351143657
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . 2005.2595580293587
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . 1497.2607323693046
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so <UNK> . 1728.9362450829396
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 2101.4299146131943
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . " As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the <UNK> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . 1772.5212052172512
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room . 1443.855039074673
That he was surprised by the <UNK> was evident ; he <UNK> it however with <UNK> , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner . 2025.7842342687984
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 2043.2568695494213
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 1090.804359185895
Gardiner , though unknown . 419.2444647349012
" Your ' s , c . " This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be <UNK> , by the sister at least . 1565.42597374551
I was given good <UNK> , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 1662.6997865079036
You must and shall be married by a special licence . 1070.2311484754548
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 1698.5575936182804
Very nonsensical to come at all ! 1133.2176769213747
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 973.7206407965693
Bennet . 72.5898345451325
Collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . 1152.0652264523442
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was . 1473.5653188006504
To his <UNK> engagement with Miss De Bourgh ? 1194.1239601874508
" <UNK> Oh ! 301.87317630603184
<UNK> would like to go too of all things ! 1921.3248562998733
She <UNK> Miss <UNK> a treasure . 1165.9809140304933
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 2435.7770703193496
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . 1796.4612994053948
He was received by Mrs . 225.98217119367746
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago . 1478.4268125244917
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . 1190.7171726524389
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh . 1701.4549740789676
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 1248.066485284608
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . 425.1223835607308
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Any other inconsistencies with modern <UNK> have been left as printed . 2141.4449094564734
CHAPTER II . 226.77357108648664
Her <UNK> wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . 1640.2065519972175
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
it is of no consequence . 870.3385066004145
The loo table , however , did not appear . 692.0550310443746
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . " Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . 1630.469287708251
<UNK> on Jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy ' s explanation , by <UNK> Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 1795.451867636662
Hurst and Miss Bingley . 233.07367889662234
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that <UNK> is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . 2719.876483269416
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . 1190.4326964147845
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <UNK> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <UNK> . 2386.2135512151617
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . 1189.3260284044609
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so <UNK> with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and <UNK> of her own family ! 2421.2478593861633
It was a fortnight since Mrs . 268.64403341819377
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 1020.2566921918651
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 2066.4945967571985
You are safe from me . " " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . " " And your defect is a <UNK> to hate every body . " " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . " " Do let us have a little music , " cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . " Louisa , you will not mind my <UNK> Mr . Hurst . " Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . 1670.3098072024197
But here , by carrying with me one <UNK> source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <UNK> . 2180.7862503102706
It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ? 891.7443727360283
" My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . " They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . " " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence . " " You cannot be too much on your guard . 1568.247967343595
Bennet ' s civilities . 291.3798101928227
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . 1584.9793333173352
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 831.0709351539413
Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated . 2307.544029054008
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . " " That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever heard you utter . 1536.7424468404056
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very <UNK> manner , with all the <UNK> which he supposed a regular part of the business . 2555.2445320583
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . 1238.482819431217
My poor father ! 473.69189854045686
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . " Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right . 1365.9498407511983
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . 280.367051574508
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . 1200.7865655932574
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a <UNK> profit c <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under the laws of the state of <UNK> and <UNK> tax exempt status by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . 2521.712996491038
But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . " " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . " Elizabeth made no answer . 1327.3161569866465
It is too long ago . 380.6365215285542
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . 2250.269921399027
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from <UNK> my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . 1729.828400045541
my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " Oh , lord ! 844.0043904350949
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . 1846.176720042169
Your <UNK> makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a <UNK> . " " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! 2189.1408942996895
I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . 1270.7836540220949
Their table was <UNK> stupid . 1179.9927212396956
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . " " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! 1477.2536024231927
Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . 1864.4175724601903
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . 967.6494099535852
" Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . " She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . 1861.2948359787558
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . 1383.7087923450729
" E . 242.557200211503
They soon <UNK> the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . 709.2943842252433
Bennet was most <UNK> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 2001.78998404456
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . 1123.0877306633085
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <UNK> manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . 1845.5489585595733
Bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . 1480.2663129358284
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? 1977.624110693536
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 1379.070473854189
Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley ' s continued absence . 784.0761559855043
The day passed much as the day before had done . 933.7903658339297
Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . 755.0371007977725
I always had a value for him . 494.7440864400903
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . 1696.5129537346322
If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was <UNK> done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . With respect to that other , more <UNK> <UNK> , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only <UNK> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 2100.0231979862324
Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . 1014.4590354975121
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . 1232.2822930904551
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company . 1522.0763325871221
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . " Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . 2460.615402298464
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 1313.9829856598108
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 1770.2956320713258
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented . 1751.3316539671562
" Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated . 1074.448123464648
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 1740.452747460736
Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . 1778.9481993260654
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of <UNK> whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to <UNK> , she began to regret that he came . 2078.0918726986965
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true <UNK> will derive benefit from such as are given . 2487.319489295434
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! 1794.3693822911869
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . 1935.9562796820587
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . 1660.5049191017679
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . 1308.8868951723612
I am very , very sorry . 413.3156312842885
Thank God ! 552.7448926558314
GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 2152.72016024114
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . 1452.2383557698186
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? 1928.9796539319077
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 1228.1985536767174
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world . 1766.1038993508498
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out . She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . 2127.5848628530443
Forster , the delight of Mrs . 394.6018172846488
" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . 1327.0609164318962
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? 2135.863197283291
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " <UNK> in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . 1470.567945734203
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . 1514.4014517600144
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr . Darcy , she moved again towards the gate . 1339.7908710564805
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general <UNK> to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . 1990.4028437884538
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 1863.6655503750583
You give me fresh life and <UNK> . 1279.4283938886388
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . 2252.6526669546474
You must therefore allow me to follow the <UNK> of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . 2233.1730854129146
Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not <UNK> . 1469.4276860041412
Bennet one communication would , therefore , do for all . 861.0294475427567
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . 1875.0215352420103
Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <UNK> . 1901.6526977128074
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission . 1126.2617549655538
Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . 2024.5382650246986
She does not yet leave her dressing room . 754.2539530686952
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 2003.5160872002182
On finding Mrs . 246.30444843779043
Long will do any such thing . 804.9270532816763
CHAPTER VII . 251.15965623927994
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . " Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . 1925.2211517908186
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . 726.568790309308
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ' s performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste . 1847.9196951195208
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation . 1998.355683938295
Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . 1351.6123553047564
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged . 1911.0071438806265
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 1702.5938903231283
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 1725.6733128941323
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . 596.8493359723074
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . 1994.7927855926014
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
They had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister . 1067.2643002992634
I am so grieved for him . 266.27663562467785
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . 1729.066705784418
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 800.2840900830221
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 1349.6463135941062
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 1568.2988687013533
The extravagance and general <UNK> which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 1786.1176968640616
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . 1983.1353327447664
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . " Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . 1999.1122955582678
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . 1591.293967639126
" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not <UNK> declare that Caroline neither <UNK> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <UNK> the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly ! to put me on my guard ? 2283.5599066413183
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . 1485.2915310280061
Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night <UNK> and <UNK> gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty <UNK> away . " " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " " You go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds ! 2227.5592725063393
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . 2027.6792803241824
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . 2102.213709828902
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most <UNK> in inviting Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 2176.7878157783116
" <UNK> in other words , you are determined to have him . 1015.9091268057596
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , <UNK> had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 2271.4816636698165
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . " Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . 1758.3951617141875
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost . 1632.1337735499724
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 2204.126553622465
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth ! 1515.2985661324226
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 1805.768911909467
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . 1134.104542981562
" If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . 1262.8897999078745
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . 1282.5992611502354
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . 2434.5745979951394
Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . 2019.0471098901194
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 2019.87467708424
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . 1185.6563269867452
CHAPTER XIV . 237.11669479662504
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . 1938.342517791521
Have you had any flirting ? 953.460493451653
Brighton , and a whole <UNK> of <UNK> , to us , who have been <UNK> already by one poor regiment of militia , and the <UNK> balls of Meryton . " " Now I have got some news for you , " said Lydia , as they sat down to table . 1970.0335812577607
By this time she is actually with them ! 1316.7202092639736
Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane ' s ? 1232.2985819243888
Pray read on . " " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she <UNK> so disgraceful a match . 2289.2977783253195

His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . 1965.3937099691163
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . " Hunsford , near <UNK> , Kent , th <UNK> . DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . " There , Mrs . 2623.485947341824
CHAPTER III . 226.77357108648664
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . 1995.4885181165598
He has children of his own , and may have more . 742.9445292796779
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 1657.6532562096124
They <UNK> their wretchedness , however , by <UNK> after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . 2287.856009458977
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 1347.6701059361824
In the dining room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before . 1526.449326122124
Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ' s <UNK> enough to <UNK> him from its <UNK> , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never <UNK> without him . " " So much the better . 1648.959382682389
Her mother ' s <UNK> , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . 1734.772599316175
This room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . 1819.9573591419444
They will never be distressed for money . 814.3579052187364
His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . 1559.9909638792008
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . 1418.9638551057653
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease . 2056.300183311009
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , <UNK> , absurd . 2033.302691185936
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . 880.5794476329464
CHAPTER VIII . 237.11669479662504
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 1439.4535938550905
Has it not been <UNK> <UNK> by yourselves ? 1955.2664003896996
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . 1588.0123751806443
" Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . 733.0813506767493
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . 1095.5506388007248
He was <UNK> for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have <UNK> it . 1575.8195563856937
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <UNK> . " " And this is your real opinion ! 1841.821851524487
Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . 1020.3328638466701
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement <UNK> the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be <UNK> to make the <UNK> disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law . 2662.300884492339
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? 2111.1405233743963
" Oh ! 42.46667514260318
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . 2134.042838849806
It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed <UNK> ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among <UNK> woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its <UNK> parts . 2357.1810798206616
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate . 2153.2293904661187
<UNK> Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . " " If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . " " She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . 1665.9216742414299
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . " " Ah ! 906.3607992620069
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short <UNK> . " " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . 1869.1611330124356
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 2038.3219297973253
Bingley and talked of Mrs . 344.00079695271575
Annesley is with her . 448.712922243041
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 1299.2170286658234
Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for . 664.0585387696991
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 698.8490032843184
Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton . 1494.8916761993717
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <UNK> the excellent understanding , and <UNK> excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 2124.361396862894
Again she read on . 753.5186562372022
" Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss Bingley ; " and pray what is the result ? " " I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect . 846.2034309513674
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . 1160.9024957014578
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? 1755.5948033866193
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <UNK> , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . 1691.2201749957233
Bennet said only , " <UNK> , nonsense ! " " What can be the meaning of that <UNK> exclamation ? " cried he . 1693.7115071967116
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 1657.4761917343048
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 2060.1483575636257
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 2229.069178607246
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 1658.6666846877358
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time . 1715.0931705360886
" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt . 1365.3802196249385
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . 2135.3768602568944
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . 2487.2943523475287
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . 1580.0139955599702
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried . 756.1095695333196
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . 1341.347575510503
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever <UNK> , and the <UNK> friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . 1626.373643190387
" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . 821.4397510592778
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 956.3549822312124
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . 641.0447719137727
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . 1971.037337008605
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 443.7364563659856
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <UNK> . 1413.3544847818825
Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . " " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . 1171.1307331967027
I do not wish to avoid the walk . 486.73897643165265
where is your <UNK> my dear ? " But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 1862.9915061694558
They <UNK> it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . 1919.5576208978466
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> . 2605.005022799549
A fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . 1228.29316804018
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . 1994.7293217913557
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 2331.7758943103204
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 715.7648376369615
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my <UNK> from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . 2029.3951370626485
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 944.5909241510226
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . 1722.3456526425614
<UNK> away the letter immediately and <UNK> a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . " " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . 1602.1449703144378
Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 735.8905799487701
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! 1763.9820040251107
Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . 1724.8318406938051
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 979.5034823862255
Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . 1268.9311511616668
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one <UNK> in it an object of compassion , while they are <UNK> of our intimacy at Rosings . " <UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> . 2577.8956194793845
" I am sorry it went off . 310.9269261178187
CHAPTER IX . 237.11669479662504
<UNK> , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . 2632.933229691624
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold enough to say before how much I like him . 1512.7139054077315
But the case is this . 448.6080545953174
" I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . 990.1360034332633
He seldom appeared really animated . 720.9531406413078
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . 735.3300484950321
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . 1044.6505363433341
She felt <UNK> the justice of Mr . Darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 1339.4966216133346
You take delight in <UNK> me . 832.3427072140752
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . 1992.7915709215022
Elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . 1539.4697948053183
Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . 1218.2042667762296
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . 1885.265033623418
My father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . 1811.349715797095
Of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was <UNK> with admiration was evident enough . 2220.959012211154
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a <UNK> . 1926.5175159285807
He heard her with astonishment . 513.4224890884997
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . 1576.37986065416
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 1915.8895765846148
He was angry . 266.4029984552862
" My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . " But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . 1945.4832643205286
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . 1342.0641033146132
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 1593.3467117900846
See paragraph . E below . 872.8158785193064
You may have drawn him in . " " If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . " " Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? 1071.535322016408
Bennet , alarmed . 264.3839490364358
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . 1534.9531563632918
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 1587.2546541677455
" I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth . 540.9668767559074
I write rather slowly . " " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! 1126.1576532879449
As no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins ' s scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . 1082.2765770111814
Gardiner . 126.27619172372152
On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and told her with great <UNK> that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . 2125.585363794329
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . 786.2869195262757
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . 1052.3411677892964
I did for you . 255.43855678801958
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <UNK> , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 1842.0296597196113
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been <UNK> by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 2165.917809454831
Mr . Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . 713.9625135439456
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for <UNK> Lodge , the <UNK> are dreadful . " Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . 2067.703086841553
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . 628.0341958559425
Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 773.8957778181012
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring . 370.4814191005797
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . 967.1216537226805
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 1959.0543384176556
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <UNK> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <UNK> , and paid off every <UNK> of civility to Elizabeth . 2453.9402659581424
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 620.2170337864952
If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 1537.8434741628562
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 1426.8860784485512
I shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will <UNK> and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " Elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 1919.5834074652569
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <UNK> in the gaieties which that season generally <UNK> , and that your <UNK> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall <UNK> you . " " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . " " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . " " Why will you think so ? 1864.9911582236018
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . 1874.543119473114
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <UNK> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . 1970.2057792731407
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s . 1112.2397469858674
Collins , did I tell you of Lady <UNK> ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? 1822.68515119704
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 2094.9443483751306
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of <UNK> should not be broken in on . 2038.7344238384342
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> . 3031.7386886796535
<UNK> as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . 2359.179875063235
Elizabeth immediately <UNK> the livery , guessed what it meant , and <UNK> no small degree of surprise to her relations , by <UNK> them with the honour which she expected . 2732.9888005237217
I had not believed it possible . " " I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth . 570.4653582958603
I will read you the passage which particularly <UNK> me . 973.9236276672957
. F . . Some states do not allow <UNK> of certain implied <UNK> or the exclusion or limitation of certain <UNK> of damages . 2565.8558470159023
Jenkinson to make up her party . 911.0316219711142
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . " " She is a very fine looking woman ! 825.4056079379227
I write without any intention of <UNK> you , or <UNK> myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the <UNK> , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . 2143.051502599036
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . 1888.3451489201643
He studies too much for words of four <UNK> . Do not you , Darcy ? " " My style of writing is very different from yours . " " Oh ! " cried Miss Bingley , " Charles <UNK> in the most careless way imaginable . 1462.858585126039
Allowing for the common <UNK> of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy . 1558.8802575211778
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . 1410.4529588725068
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better <UNK> room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . 2223.3656020852654
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <UNK> ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had <UNK> , in his offer to herself . 2170.052961275315
That he has neither integrity nor honour . 1050.7088072458102
Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in Mrs . 1542.9944422786864
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . " " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <UNK> of you . 1738.5719131583771
I have a high respect for your nerves . 721.718013577255
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! 1304.2759100814365
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . 1274.1904291310739
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 1894.5538076307369
Every thing being settled between them , Mr . Darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home . 1352.680565813194
Pray forgive me , if I have been very <UNK> , or at least do not punish me so far , as to <UNK> me from <UNK> . 2165.711962620842
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 1836.0563092974746
Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 1462.6831970901455
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . 1294.4903719623887
Those who do not complain are never pitied . " Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or <UNK> her would only increase the irritation . 2643.754526907967
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being <UNK> dressed . 1668.2535869723029
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be <UNK> from it . 1475.1796221029067
She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <UNK> him with fears and regrets in <UNK> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 1974.691019423833
Your <UNK> must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance . 2312.3012238549
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . 1275.9178060363117
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . 2102.3245298265097
<UNK> at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . 2534.7195620945176
She longed to see Mrs . 291.69133207772836
Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? 2012.262058712389
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . 677.1154702976463
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them . 1629.1950284877285
<UNK> <UNK> the face of Mrs . 792.6950938776598
Poor Jane ! 454.3778423397201
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . 1706.1283382862794
But so they always are . 642.821429126581
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 1018.5913853047216
The letter was to this effect " MY DEAR <UNK> , " I wish you joy . 1139.539594783464
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . 1612.6640051995057
How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? " " That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . 1743.0670648851506

What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? 1568.3773279374134
They are wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? " " They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . " " But if you have got them to day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered . " She did at last <UNK> from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . 1433.7848799550375
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 1491.4613060270055
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! 1503.0681753483918
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 1381.763383271043
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 891.8926772785205
" I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . 1448.8232135381027
The <UNK> pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . 1552.1473819685934
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 2295.8001899603023
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 1483.8374517247034
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater <UNK> than first <UNK> often boast ; and so <UNK> did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were <UNK> to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 2886.419287204067
At present we have nothing to guide us . 868.1634255900414
But it was a hope shortly checked by other <UNK> , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . 2124.2680930375004
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . 1983.9501769327771
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should <UNK> an occasion of <UNK> his respect towards any body connected with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared . Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . 2040.7436097463815
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell <UNK> to mend a great <UNK> in my worked muslin gown , before they are <UNK> up . 2201.001048900524
Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the <UNK> . 1550.7831176583759
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . 1293.7917100707903
Elizabeth was <UNK> enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 1567.5489593313862
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of <UNK> and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 2379.1876473175294
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . 1643.0642180010834
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a <UNK> , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , <UNK> to Kitty and Lydia . 2410.2493107119826
Does your charge give you much trouble ? 1454.3830690828022
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to <UNK> his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be <UNK> <UNK> . 2145.120181901327
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . 1975.7493634088526
Kitty was the only one who <UNK> tears ; but she did <UNK> from vexation and envy . 2123.491525690818
These were the contents " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . 2022.1758021264693
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . 1052.3375128468992
But now it comes out . " " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows . 999.8539666073049
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 2182.7213052700895
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . " " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . 1761.5456116511066
" But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . " Elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . 1603.944201401351
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 2058.8086069952683
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . 1342.5191315041727
It was only said , ' <UNK> , George Wickham , <UNK> . 1489.257464074892
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . 1031.9158390523544
" Not at all . 182.95290682730828
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . 2101.8528434899995
Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 1471.8345132963263
Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . " " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . " " I believe , Ma ' am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . " " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . 1083.5867469578152
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely . 1165.3196268254844
While these <UNK> born notions were passing in their <UNK> , the perturbation of Elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . 2254.893403398953
My sisters may write to me . 589.7517328515491
Mr . Wickham ' s chief object was <UNK> my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of <UNK> himself on me , was a strong inducement . 1529.9391686289644
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at <UNK> ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . 2044.6294836833324
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs . 852.8910485484042
Your ' s , very sincerely , " <UNK> . 1191.1932457540286
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
but no one can throw any blame on them . 1002.7935919924698
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . 1896.9047655158056
" A <UNK> ! " she cried . 640.1604667153307
Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . " Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . 1456.4884654018267
CHAPTER XV . 237.11669479662504
Gardiner abused her stupidity . 679.5181287878289
She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs . 452.611729659056
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 1148.0879236094702
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth . 1516.2788895251458
Lizzy <UNK> she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . " " And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems an hopeless business . " " <UNK> to Lizzy about it yourself . 1362.8699695703865
Long . 222.30602727260205
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . " Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . 2211.6353006853988
A younger son , you know , must be <UNK> to self denial and dependence . " " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either . 1699.5416770473553
CHAPTER XVII . 237.11669479662504
Mary <UNK> for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . 2200.2144397247976
He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable house . 1287.832924358192
They had long wished to see him . 470.7007556647317
I shall go distracted . " This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . 1659.5400676326533
are sufficiently known . 789.7404612287078
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . 2214.4544990615364
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . 1272.9478555618327
You see on what a footing we are . 1051.3723778522988
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it . 727.451958326041
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object . 797.9502162747721
His debts are to be paid , <UNK> , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased . 1785.3164803308305
CHAPTER XVI . 237.11669479662504
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . 1933.9792093837943
He <UNK> how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an <UNK> manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there . 1715.8317558817046
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . 1688.3428477456278
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . 954.5071230890751
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . 1739.5375383300122
His letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in <UNK> business , he was quick in its execution . 1922.9950461192504
We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation . 1422.5514256542026
Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . 1259.4136052536526
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . 2225.024235597093
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two . 1862.8842582883133
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character . 1298.7183028053732
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . 1283.164781880341
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 1195.164373563692
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was <UNK> for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . 2543.6680914320364
Thank Heaven ! 396.78424830594076
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . 1504.6232615311264
But that is one great difference between us . 760.3175654542249
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 1723.091440004121
And for this we are to be thankful . 946.1600414262829
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 1835.0071325472586
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . " " My beauty you had early <UNK> , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . 1820.285546177894
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . 1333.8806742259574
I will try again . 246.53863280024083
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 1968.1290929809443
You must contrive to send somebody . 720.3565190302718
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees . 1977.3921379365356
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . 1135.929159979515
<UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her . 2205.8713167033793
Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in <UNK> , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and <UNK> a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire . 2361.3674076724596
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . 336.7626418958628
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you ! 945.1418341882678
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . 1155.3823961357566
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty <UNK> , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . 2141.9166179031436
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . " " Oh ! " said Lydia <UNK> , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , I ' <UNK> the <UNK> . " The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . 1522.0068106402057
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , <UNK> , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . 2065.3561047044004
In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 1244.4936672833571
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 2182.17568733703
Lady Catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . 1435.3506063386874
Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . 1342.7782427446907
" Oh , Jane , take care . " " My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . " " I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . " They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs . 1137.2476093572996
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . 2418.877709600547
" I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could . 643.6945164037166
Illustration <UNK> PRIDE AND PREJUDICE A Novel . 1420.2615901764523
Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very <UNK> too for it is provoking me to <UNK> , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly . 1527.9102046921219
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . 1475.9887430576719
" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . 1230.7001967309316
What could your ladyship propose by it ? " " At once to insist upon having such a report universally <UNK> . " " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . " " If ! 1590.6289074669633
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she <UNK> in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . 2343.576157197288
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper <UNK> . 2236.695972146816
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham . 556.5186390972653
<UNK> me in silence . 1144.632883227373
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the <UNK> , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 2504.575274414099
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . " " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . 1759.2836853928632
The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of <UNK> , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her <UNK> <UNK> . 2336.522746748077
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B . 1624.9841682106442
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 1257.0507206256163
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent . 1434.8467490984085
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . 2063.613485613185
Gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , <UNK> of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 2152.998599549539
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <UNK> . 1814.4103626872748
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 1536.4917523240613
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . 1088.4206297325582
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! 1371.5265093227124
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 1819.1420796147434
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . 1596.0802839345217
My courage always <UNK> with every attempt to <UNK> me . " " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . " Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . 1901.0420688953852
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . " " Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . 1774.1644450644126
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 848.2487141282531
Mr . Wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a <UNK> as she could . 1014.3680623759534
Her <UNK> are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . 1833.3578786435708
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and <UNK> in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . 2227.2836268227775
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be <UNK> to her nieces . 2076.3592176064762
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly <UNK> . 1630.0909412988478
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 1931.6264888025096
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 2081.2830371741743
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . " " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 1281.2086896520177
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 1542.682330950831
Why should they try to influence him ? 1068.199538451012
Bennet was <UNK> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and <UNK> in her <UNK> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the <UNK> happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 2350.4841121367317
When you told Mrs . 305.33290562634426
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I cannot blame myself for having done thus much . 2097.0886833833993
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ? 1658.713332367377
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 1483.4481779353557
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had <UNK> to his amusement . 2066.9977116632504
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . 1906.1316776326007
You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her <UNK> , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . 1312.3649760654398
I had not an idea of it . " Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . 1274.1515440563205
Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . 1660.8344514998714
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W . 2069.484056060341
Good bye . " She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she <UNK> about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . 1863.5860726298472
" But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy . 1679.1744834342824
His reception however was of the most flattering kind . 1048.4484395800766
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . 1547.7335628194705
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . 1920.6322856595486
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . 1533.460863672463
What relates to yourself , is as follows . 1107.0977207183316
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in <UNK> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " said Jane as she finished it . 1915.8861864034307
The Miss <UNK> all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . Do you draw ? " " No , not at all . " " What , none of you ? " " Not one . " " That is very strange . 1172.7800898772225
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 930.9505537391967
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? 1524.9533101101895
Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley . 1185.6483138783124
You have delighted us long enough . 572.4431916525921
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . 1586.7783997414483
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . 1566.8862030763441
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! 1779.9884543310502
Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . 1637.029147656564
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 1593.1633015288064
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your ' s seems to have been . 1628.624480122745
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . 1822.5083638435335
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 1256.3699581520366
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity . 2503.185614849198
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . 1526.9948097672564
Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him . 1354.1935681652433
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 1744.46517752301
But self , though it would intrude , could not <UNK> her . 1068.2217279564477
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 1925.8309413322645
He now wished it more than ever . 764.365724740659
A great deal more passed at the other table . 1016.9868333916676
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such <UNK> as these . 1699.9728646480241
Their first subject was the <UNK> of the Rosings party . " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . 1517.2033750530052
I am so pleased so happy . 402.3179502748704
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " Oh ! " cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted . 1198.8042919904558
People do not die of little trifling <UNK> . 1906.8346919133298
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . 1647.4357344996517
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . 1035.1012476073645
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company . 1506.6353486981614
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr . <UNK> . 1963.9997278414376
" Oh ! 42.46667514260318
As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it <UNK> and lovely as ever . 1907.3538038278155
We were always good friends ; and now we are better . " " True . 1022.7194562335592
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished . 1175.7013297828757
" With my mother up stairs . 603.5309523403063
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . " He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 2343.695641725771
The children have been wanting me this half hour . 994.1369869082283
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . 1060.7404585686538
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 1688.156060183039
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very <UNK> in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . 2336.359466562823
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 613.5484719485652
" I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . 778.6493846832973
" Upon my word , " said Mrs . 198.65611289074113
<UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill . 1623.673070108256
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ' s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . 1840.1367350592404
And do you really love him quite well enough ? 1190.9084031954062
It is almost past belief . 461.315280925298
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was Elizabeth ' s intimate friend . 1501.0551985744473
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference . 1238.996999592648
Mr . Bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . 2016.3757316467618
What am I to do ? " " Nothing child , nothing . 962.2894368844171
They walked on , without knowing in what direction . 1055.296411252019
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . 1229.9683273726764
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . 641.2701179277714
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 1031.5227785959369
Mr . Darcy <UNK> you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . 798.9762580464874
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be <UNK> to you to let them go alone . " " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " " Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . 1753.1543629065632
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of <UNK> , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 2321.4003688259177
Mr . Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . 1122.8333173271255
Bennet , who <UNK> with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be <UNK> enough . 1692.0248237636679
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 1313.918747386247
They will take care not to <UNK> their income . 1225.0343478299046
Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a <UNK> to buy clothes for his daughter . 1928.9404969763305
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . 1186.233246637493
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! 1271.966955997017
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . 1701.7305467564586
<UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . 1230.2829362559226
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . 1023.3858620061222
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . 1740.0340541521477
Is not he a charming man ? 965.3455526750801
But there was still something <UNK> behind , of which prudence <UNK> the <UNK> . 1795.2432618164585
Lydia ' s going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . 1714.5624579950763
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 2171.6113639196715
CHAPTER <UNK> . 544.6584579434565
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object . 1115.966208304506
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . 931.3092042543451
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much <UNK> ; but when Mrs . 1989.204315146595
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character . 1770.6411747803018
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day . " " Oh , yes . 1184.0403649200723
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . 963.7507990618353
The housekeeper came ; a respectable looking , <UNK> woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . 1825.5987646668198
And she was only sixteen last June . 999.8224208339172
" Good Heaven ! 213.20610957303185
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . 1351.9496014399542
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all <UNK> , was still <UNK> <UNK> . 2224.20268474719
But she is nothing to me now . 597.9871947518013
Only look at her . 434.3213778122308
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the <UNK> Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . 1434.2726419694861
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 1237.979957964431
Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her <UNK> and <UNK> , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with Miss Bennet . 2036.7523378427113
Jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all . 698.6833341104214
Lord bless me ! 616.0229008747855
At length the chaise arrived , the <UNK> were <UNK> on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . 2033.859071490284
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 2195.60408346062
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . 1360.3853155136312
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . 1177.121428550497
It was over at last however . 551.7051864513345
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will <UNK> you ; and so generous , that you will always <UNK> your income . " " I hope not so . 1834.5915438600478
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 2270.3616828683826
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 753.6740187242297
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . 1841.0419511296907
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up . 1211.175921524836
I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . " " You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr . Darcy . " " No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ' s connections . 1298.7148616804673
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . 1597.5497193048761
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <UNK> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 2398.2118097971265
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . 728.0082093212674
<UNK> to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . 1885.8528578027538
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas ' s last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the <UNK> were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three <UNK> <UNK> at least . 2033.9711209367833
I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . 1623.3462674433001
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the <UNK> , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening . 2023.771517344058
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 1376.1751628204881

CHAPTER XVII . 237.11669479662504
" It certainly is a most <UNK> affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . 985.5696711806177
My mind was more agreeably engaged . 896.177314263716
Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . " " To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart . 2252.304922070931
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well . 1588.0184674685713
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother . 1048.1201759266817
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . 1624.435843161508
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <UNK> satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 2370.845853233644
Her colour changed , and she said no more . 708.8585487464028
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 1135.0754216246553
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been <UNK> by long expectations . 1280.9451444432455
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 1902.267092970464
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 317.49599214768966
You never see a fault in any body . 904.4109481979838
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . 1579.0836790292994
I wonder what he can be doing there . " " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth . 889.1498737707279
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . 1757.151284765505
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . 1558.9398598449225
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <UNK> them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 2226.564292997017
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs . 799.635217389544
But it is so strange ! " " Yes that is what makes it amusing . 929.3591977589741
" DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations . 1016.9957945221569
The evening passed quietly , <UNK> by any thing extraordinary . 1380.3041057989947
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 1715.4967293591367
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <UNK> than to herself . 1296.0345187802977
" My aunt , " she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor street . " She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley . 1345.0612977497378
<UNK> back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write <UNK> . 2047.8829355515652
" You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried . 476.93887020401723
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . 1416.2561684965299
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this <UNK> . 1819.9116223682206
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . 1203.7414322404998
She has two nieces of her own . 572.7117648075395
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? " " Most willingly . " " You shall have it in few words . 1443.3237670889428
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . " The wedding took place ; the bride and <UNK> set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . 2074.160111251721
Their reception at home was most kind . 986.3712168659273
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 1777.6749822179806
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 1055.4842490635601
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 581.5026559181227
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 1374.8957652333406
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his <UNK> when he speaks . 1496.7872380375416
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 651.7141350918877
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy . 1427.7536162247754
" From what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs . 647.1516726769089
Elizabeth took up some <UNK> , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . 1827.5703546315829
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . 1488.9206033543335
Who would have thought it ! 705.5005413973873
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself . 862.4066549862686
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " As Mrs . 1331.8545699648987
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr . Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent . 1676.7459320745056
In pompous <UNK> on his side , and civil <UNK> on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton . 2102.3103409336204
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 1055.0715780475118
His apparent partiality had <UNK> , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . 1628.3592304495899
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <UNK> of my son in law . 2391.4235025541034
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! 1520.2591090129006
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . 672.3911286759696
I told my sister Philips so the other day . 783.0654317036
I think she will be pleased with the <UNK> . " Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs . 1857.293375640497
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . " " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request . 869.9629012035571
On the following Monday , Mrs . 366.5769720573035
As for your Elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what <UNK> could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye <UNK> , so remarkably fine , might be copied . " At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . 2026.1888760235572
" How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . You think it a faithful <UNK> undoubtedly . " " I must not decide on my own performance . " He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . 1774.2439305620446
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 1254.0092029844873
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . 1943.969678442092
Bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . 721.5638884737222
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . 1250.1599015842537
A lively imagination soon settled it all . 827.3608143370126
" Good gracious ! 200.90600194415123
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of <UNK> for them . 2196.7479659749565
And poor Mr . Darcy ! 312.83586397165516
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had . 1201.1113038005028
He could number the <UNK> in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <UNK> . 2136.0424134382997
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the <UNK> curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two <UNK> of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . The envelope itself was likewise full . <UNK> her way along the lane , she then began it . 2526.6931485798605
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been <UNK> , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . 1660.6805535204678
Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . 1801.2818284541238
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and <UNK> <UNK> with great perseverance . 1763.7981710564304
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 1966.0840602008502
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 1339.032541552367
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . 920.4056185174795
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . 959.2442544488025
I do not know who is good enough for him . " Mr . and Mrs . 321.68236616221077
CHAPTER IX . 237.11669479662504
" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party . 1120.2438355433103
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 1542.0536452441806
Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 1438.897603806314
You <UNK> me for coming ? " " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you . 1473.2277000658926
" Yes if Darcy does not put it off again . 899.1083572417276
As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner ' s hope of Lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its <UNK> . 1686.7754028572085
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . 764.8691556194716
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . 1639.401652001899
This Mrs . 139.48352776314218
It is impossible that he should still love me . " After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on <UNK> their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water <UNK> , there <UNK> to be a little alteration . 2292.487892194956
I shall now know how to act . 660.9241660598593
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <UNK> . 2096.586145364233
" I admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he . 749.5647523016241
He was very fond of them . " This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham ' s being among them . 744.2454539384183
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . 2007.2996004922445
Bennet could hardly contain herself . 442.37015486307956
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? 1852.6130578698526
that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! 1019.5103173275511
" So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find . 964.0609710480583
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were <UNK> in her favour . 2131.907877499092
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable . 1248.6238504736677
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . " While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much <UNK> to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s . 2170.617944637056
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . 1651.1440606996873
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . 1112.2210790837294
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . " " Good <UNK> ! " cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? How could his will be <UNK> ? Why did not you seek legal <UNK> ? " " There was just such an <UNK> in the terms of the <UNK> as to give me no hope from law . 2178.7044645004717
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 1410.0156978076263
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . " " You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . 1323.1228277837722
And is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? 1248.2725111339428
Section . 283.98127128057695
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <UNK> infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . 2492.95084883604
" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides <UNK> tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! " Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . 2120.0748059325656
Let me never see either one or the other again ! " Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no <UNK> , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re <UNK> the admiration of her former lover . 2694.8872606105106
Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in <UNK> . 2157.3574742421315
There was also a postscript to this effect . 839.4931735107032
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . 1369.4770325449715
Catherine , weak <UNK> , irritable , and completely under Lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self <UNK> and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . 2617.6020345089487
The vague and unsettled suspicions which <UNK> had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 2012.1932272857418
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? 1441.9771363572756
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . " " If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . 1691.693304060948
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . 1559.456448681184
Jane <UNK> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour . 1486.3138050493392
" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . 944.9858111965594
" His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . 479.05250227873876
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . 1422.7469675230548
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation . 1626.6478754334307
what does he say ? 692.3050256670358
She answered him with cold civility . 618.9574836611522
It was really a very handsome thought . 588.4535895910627
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 1322.7304476803934
She is gone down to her uncle at <UNK> ; gone to stay . 1336.8099381481559
She blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . 1713.1564374357622
Every body declared that he was the <UNK> young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always <UNK> the appearance of his goodness . 1597.0946749305672
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! 1392.871450450445
His attachment to Rosings , certainly <UNK> . " Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 1730.1236105018543
Two <UNK> , however , were plainly <UNK> from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been <UNK> used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 1891.0325087982444
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? 1424.4046036639477
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 1393.6742834149472
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 1023.1459773729059
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . 2038.0062004701037
I wish you had been there . 378.46059869056677
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
They agree with me in <UNK> that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the <UNK> of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself <UNK> says , will connect themselves with such a family . 2483.1620737518742
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . 1446.255477685086
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . 1395.5466930822213
The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 1861.020411876234
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . 1373.0540518412965
Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . 1527.862630465455
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 2332.0398917230696
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . " " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be . 1392.326745383441
Mr . Darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . 624.2608116430528

Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? 1384.5334973709432
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 1665.6153530912245
You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! 433.4387262395067
Hill began instantly to express her joy . 1167.5600186322165
Can I speak <UNK> ? 1263.3936116849009
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . 1445.852788330767
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 1843.6785395240543
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " " But I was embarrassed . " " And so was I . " " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " " A man who had felt less , might . " " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 1614.412615886751
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey . 1454.488553949346
" I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr . Darcy ! " " It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . " " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . " " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . " " <UNK> ! 1345.4691331290794
Elizabeth longed to <UNK> its <UNK> ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . 1530.5141275990609
" It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . 690.0734790867835
my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned . 666.0637175360042
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <UNK> by the possessor , and often without any attention to the <UNK> of the performance . 2434.8892586662396
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . 1298.9694104607943
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall <UNK> a list , according to his information . 2051.444404300166
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 1842.0692334380337
CHAPTER <UNK> . 544.6584579434565
Now is your time . 632.22084169665
In ran Mrs . 214.06736627206425
When they repaired to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 1568.9512691746118
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 821.2053968195185
Mr . Darcy ! and so it does I <UNK> . 692.5468837972788
It was first broken by Mrs . 280.6321698816424
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 2003.38615866344
But he is an ugly fellow ! 646.5782173962441
<UNK> the Foundation as set forth in Section below . 1669.4094378284844
He does not want abilities . 685.9652250357396
" <UNK> he will not leave London before he has found them . 1183.2001236555363
I quite detest the man . " CHAPTER IV . 758.2598358670148
Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? " " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . 2041.5122418801102
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
It was to this effect " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well . 1643.754057432813
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 1726.2657042965495
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . 977.7967781913611
When Mrs . 124.41990755236449
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was <UNK> her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs . 1613.0456114834383
Though Lydia ' s short letter to Mrs . 540.4167023025121
But gracious me ! 324.69083784194953
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <UNK> . 1793.5349278159179
no . " " I can much more easily believe Mr . Bingley ' s being imposed on , than that Mr . Wickham should <UNK> such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , <UNK> , every thing mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr . Darcy contradict it . 1638.3153345923026
Lydia was Lydia still ; <UNK> , <UNK> , wild , noisy , and <UNK> . 2579.9593816836154
Elizabeth , after slightly <UNK> it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . 1664.1543455274525
" I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ' s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . 1106.1199681403468
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . 1708.4809515198663
Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! 773.865461035264
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 1854.8611802245077
and Mrs . 89.66574731172439
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . " " I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 1522.911866790915
I thought it my duty to give the <UNK> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well <UNK> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . 2027.4874052147732
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister . 1138.4369307970276
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . 1100.0529153451266
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 1212.8350554754236
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 1404.8836575093737
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s <UNK> . 1290.3031969978026
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 1404.2477118384493
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 1127.9204217447482
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle . 1319.8836641857552
I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . 898.4419790890676
With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . 1932.581973829176
what is it about ? 836.5730107390016
But now it was all too natural . 762.1235177130833
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 1853.4938734713471
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . 1335.975732021223
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 1873.0294166073224
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 1266.0360088086306
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <UNK> family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . 1959.634776398595
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 1797.2287532730113
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not <UNK> me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . 2071.887980270145
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 1679.8798312166555
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <UNK> ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . 1592.3309460625937
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . 1513.5038352629138
On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . 1284.5264256999471
Bennet was restored to her usual <UNK> serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the <UNK> office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton . 2548.316468069473
Its banks were neither formal , nor <UNK> adorned . 1938.495963798014
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 2107.7481019246065
<UNK> there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or <UNK> . 2623.5708472196866
A little time therefore . I shall certainly try to get the better . " With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . " " My dear Jane ! " exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good . 1608.5074983709055
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . " " I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your <UNK> what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . 1460.7227080833698
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the <UNK> . " This was not very consoling to Mrs . 1264.3986574782145
The Foundation ' s <UNK> or federal tax <UNK> number is . 1491.192703257135
At five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . 1753.117977181445
I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . " " I desire you will do no such thing . 1624.3776937316698

From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . 1937.925937638444
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 830.1167774338852

Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him . 2004.5099440109461
" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any <UNK> , rather adds to your other perfections . 1578.1108911826836

The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 2000.830666479787
Not these two or three years perhaps . " " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can . 1346.525020946875
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 1405.1914566911278
On both sides it was only assertion . 1112.2986107410218
what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . 1517.3948312503933

She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 2091.9615640835273

Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 1481.169690796733
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . 1922.4347906989053
He begged pardon for having displeased her . 651.0069726586412
But I suppose you had no opportunity . 614.7252682252728
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . 1706.5908393748512
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . 1889.9799355436942
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did . 1280.7121449200329

" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr . Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing after all . I consider it as one of the first <UNK> of polished societies . " " Certainly , Sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in <UNK> amongst the less polished societies of the world . Every <UNK> can dance . " Sir William only smiled . 1953.313105235074

They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr . Darcy ' s steward . 1837.6333666661487
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . 1455.8432820218973
Forster and me are such friends ! and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? 2408.97675149728
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach . 1956.5932609291208
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs . 1164.0133927843992

" Yours , c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . 1719.758148195045
I will answer for it he never cared three <UNK> about her . 1116.3160141035837
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . 1290.675965132389
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . 1974.9352164232025
At length the Parsonage was <UNK> . 993.4944652224048
This was very amiable , but Charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . 1945.4566365916296
Elizabeth was delighted . 278.16752987324315
She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . 1631.7004414229207
Good girl ! 481.24693384690016
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . 1723.7858409644423
He was on one side of her mother . 499.5385604980598
" Good Heaven ! 213.20610957303185
<UNK> or twice she could discern a <UNK> blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . 2578.884606259137
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . 1462.0884895206896
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . 1199.6430505766773
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 1391.284672509202
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 1355.2202074645502
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . 765.4514508949311
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone . 2169.6232706426313
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
If I wished to think <UNK> of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however . " " If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . " " Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . " " This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . 1671.709867621012
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 1206.6381511805935
She was going to the <UNK> ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of <UNK> , just fit to be killed . " Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . 1933.0503176671477
" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face . 1028.0047056527403
And one of my own daughters . 643.4326191118327
We have not met since the th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . " Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when <UNK> to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn . 2049.956415532658
He has the promise of an <UNK> in General ' s regiment , now quartered in the North . 1677.2535421341845
We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 1359.7210477276833
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . 1045.1882197602959
Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 1736.1473361656517
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 1276.971723065245
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . 1749.5346837983168
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of <UNK> them . 1805.3878045849406
<UNK> , of course . If you mention my name at the <UNK> , you will be attended to . " Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . 2173.8165372514914
She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece . 1459.6166829748593
The other is Miss De Bourgh . 547.3540904081233
" You write uncommonly fast . " " You are mistaken . 449.03769773035435
She went on . 291.213024319466
If I could but see you as happy ! 996.6760400482408
Darcy said nothing at all . 473.88126459369715
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 1841.0603168205566
She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> . 2084.541147920425
It was a rational scheme to be sure ! 537.2918287732421
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this <UNK> recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy ! 1554.903142980318
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . 1295.653788858347
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 1385.1116854420313
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . 724.7778413140601
Yet he is such a man ! " " Yes , yes , they must marry . 932.7679733476558
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . 521.7182247738134
We now come to the point . 695.2748061563254
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever . 1110.0467445378044
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 1633.8363843987147
My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his <UNK> in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . 2177.9995271089383
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 2328.5471282813746
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 1619.6934385494671
He was well , but so much engaged with Mr . Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . 750.8401952198825
Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . 269.1158468955924
II . 363.9987273584935
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 2131.586887314883
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . <UNK> are never of so much consequence to a father . 2616.677502767733
" Of a fine , stout , <UNK> love it may . 1454.232689450237
Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time . 708.0669498103649
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 839.6225854603988

Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 2474.480722158993
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 1316.9551582245736
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . 962.3878551975662
Reynolds was of no trifling nature . 1138.0923857135033
The garden <UNK> to the road , the house standing in it , the <UNK> pales and the <UNK> <UNK> , every thing declared they were <UNK> . 2680.501414349435
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to <UNK> him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <UNK> of your understanding , but <UNK> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <UNK> , and those which <UNK> the <UNK> ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the <UNK> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 2342.259345755985
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister . 1096.927726135539
But you have chosen your fault well . I really cannot laugh at it . 1197.611796706172
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two . 1274.2176062661079
And to be kept back on such a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . " " Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? " " With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . " Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . 1979.4289845525789
. 90.17254300020709
Have not you always hated him ? " How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! 2350.4716873524494
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . " " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . " To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <UNK> of an elegant female . 2458.4629259036287
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 1543.5102252575523
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not <UNK> a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . 1988.468108486294
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . 1861.3638302104832
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . 1317.1327551758463
Come be quick , be quick ! 1317.8411709679813
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 2197.6393196570307
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 1088.3539140238215
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs . 782.506546479484
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 850.4661175725759
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
My father bears it better . 518.5414107783323
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . 2058.5027717794974
Oh , brother , how kind you are ! 1107.46452354306
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 2178.400288876084
Collins so before you came . 768.2840922773709
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . 1989.506848357185
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest <UNK> , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any <UNK> display of regard , or any <UNK> of manner , where their two <UNK> only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 2475.8880992707645
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . 994.5597282076005
In such an <UNK> my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I <UNK> upon his goodness . " " Oh ! 1460.2148288005521
" How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! " cried Lydia . 1106.9971293806386
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head <UNK> acutely . 1620.3897737881164
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week . 1510.0376456854685
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not <UNK> their own , so much the better . 1652.1424854184586
Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at <UNK> , and Mrs . 460.5723943370909
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however <UNK> its existence might prove , had at least <UNK> one day . 2199.9275581783227
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a <UNK> as this . 1789.5030919492826
" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . " " It is no such thing . 966.9595119112122
That his anger could be carried to such a point of <UNK> resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem <UNK> , exceeded all that she could believe possible . 2303.181041661062
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . 1417.0151541090725
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . 2010.4841575819203
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do ! 1851.8879239137182
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an <UNK> on every subject . 1282.2881959625051
mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to day ? 2240.974487242749
I am very glad you liked her . 333.0466730887194
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . 1593.5454835743728
Hurst was observing their game . 895.2575311645166
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have <UNK> either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . 2032.5164580173232
Her father <UNK> by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and <UNK> mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . 2163.909847581473
A small sum could not do all this . " " No , " said her father , " Wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a <UNK> less than ten thousand pounds . 1210.6061654873345
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! 1203.3534984316361
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 952.5537544667599
" What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut . 876.0511760543696
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 1442.8634268372873
She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . 1908.6106801452893
But on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . 1503.4901367714438
Mr . Collins made his declaration in form . 504.98119821763476

" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 651.6201636641265
No , no , you shall not deceive me . 796.0353524013606
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the <UNK> ere long . " " Upon my word , Sir , " cried Elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . 1465.0298272198015
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . 1640.4072043357194
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . 1698.64629106784
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 1958.34095803962
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 1810.3187808825003
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ' s height , or rather <UNK> . " " How I long to see her again ! 1186.6085107930799
Is nothing due to me on that score ? 1438.9808822698155
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the <UNK> kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . 1623.0505255390703
Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and <UNK> her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family . 1778.5015722711921
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an <UNK> with her brother for talking such nonsense . 1933.0562422482137
I am quite well . 172.86839048638137
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . 653.3907520590217
They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy . 1861.1745077474188
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . 1753.6334384809566
They saw him often , and to his other <UNK> was now added that of general <UNK> . 1974.8356925300914
But do not be cast down . 583.52056455869
She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 1191.105639696148
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . " " You observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . " " Certainly not . " " To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! 1250.4167149441812
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . " Mrs . 725.1561415330181
Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion . 685.2118332078848
She was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . 1826.5767903698804
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . " " Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . 1827.579358741856
no . I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . " " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may <UNK> our different opinions . " " No I cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . " " The present always <UNK> you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt . 1795.0485313449442
She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent . 1481.5217654018359
" I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . " " Who do you mean , my dear ? 1014.6564225333574
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . 1401.924672927738
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 926.6693112177716
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . " Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where Mrs . 1704.2822510722792
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 2329.140480227035
" What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . 892.2114251399535
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one <UNK> idea of any thing . 1716.1801662322014
Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go . 908.9983216480667
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 1444.6639399815674
Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . 1361.9820102851443
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . 1191.698504114373
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . 1515.3271525268215
But , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . 948.240294684215
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield . 1624.393531573448
" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 1438.3874049248539
" He seems to be a most <UNK> and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so <UNK> as to let him come to us again . " " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . " " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . " Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of <UNK> , marrying , and <UNK> his <UNK> whenever it were required . 2203.127587147844
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . " " Lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . " " I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a <UNK> of character . 1593.0538413551876
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 1726.0886995287892
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . 1548.0843364825907
She saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . 1849.6910253664307
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . " Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . 1923.4115353323427
" Oh ! 42.46667514260318
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! 1498.9410749536114
" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . 1194.446781625709
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 756.4554305787175
I am sure I <UNK> ' <UNK> get a wink of sleep all night . 1063.4951553717078
Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn . 1160.4872686527922
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . 1498.1553375932972
This son was to join in <UNK> off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . 1802.224817883691
such an openness and gentleness in his manner . " " There certainly was some great <UNK> in the education of those two young men . 1996.7091311994473
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <UNK> , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 1725.584857272101
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 1083.7607728515418
" This is wholly unexpected . 404.93579782915333
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 1427.7525135399276
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . 1390.2313733997464

. F . . LIMITED <UNK> OF <UNK> OR <UNK> If you discover a defect in this electronic work within days of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from . 2664.1461383645615
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , <UNK> , manner of talking to her brother . 2447.3169399511535
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their <UNK> concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 2026.1506312337615
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . 1680.1615203405122
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the <UNK> of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . 2144.3625430936722
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 2425.501176459709
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . 1001.7235717344038
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 1378.8746751882245
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 1393.6986604132921
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him . 1299.432926407122
what news ? 409.2424704550989

The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 1857.8375107525826
It is highly improper . 365.5401259034325
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and <UNK> . 2587.675249841282
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 1493.846014323926
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . 858.0699812504158
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 1972.849714333001
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . 1026.0637400125268
Georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . 2715.139927051538
" And pray may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a <UNK> tone , " Is it in address that he improves ? 1894.8290192471977
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 1769.7318169870223
These recollections will not do at all . 763.0671082156612
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . " " Oh ! 829.495231313847
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . 2186.9495894988027
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 2193.2247405363396
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word . 1591.559421389271
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <UNK> of elegant nuptials , fine <UNK> , new carriages , and servants . 2324.14741118706
Be so kind as to <UNK> for us to Miss Darcy . 1373.5184497305856
Gardiner ' s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are <UNK> against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 1904.7101635457095
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed . 2304.297218077796
Are you going much farther ? " " No , I should have turned in a moment . " And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together . 1276.199455976751
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? " " Nearly three weeks . " " And you saw him frequently ? " " Yes , almost every day . " " His manners are very different from his cousin ' s . " " Yes , very different . 1145.519795403079
She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . 2274.9927579542805
But make a virtue of it by all means . 1016.7716083027125
The pause was to Elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . 728.7111327626366
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . 1631.9194513835728
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . 2354.404003403176
Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ' s arm <UNK> to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s . 1430.8626875771351
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <UNK> of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James ' s , with very decent composure . 1876.8572764188057
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . 1445.4437877868602
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though <UNK> with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 1604.0792873328976
I must have employment and society . 586.0433147319429
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself . 1879.1545759907303
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " " You have . 1395.0510823145714
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . " " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . " " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . " " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . " " But consider your daughters . 1296.7277373775369
She has known him only a fortnight . 683.0209589201579
Kitty and Lydia were far from <UNK> Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . 1855.7269441347971

They must all go to Brighton . 591.8239397827442
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <UNK> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . 2436.54877542383
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . " She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . " Again his astonishment was <UNK> ; and he looked at her with an expression of <UNK> incredulity and mortification . 2149.930006953903
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the <UNK> road . 1573.960997837658
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . 984.3463148345293
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . 1825.151370464885
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 1111.8448975586714
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 1743.7166969484124
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . 2118.6101348863886
Mr . Darcy <UNK> it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . 1817.6145446839653
Their manners are not equal to his . " " Certainly not ; at first . 1085.176965695307

Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some <UNK> in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . 2123.8876893668057
During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <UNK> , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . 2382.1368345921533
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley ' s heart were entertained . 1407.0718558125577
She had even learnt to <UNK> , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a <UNK> to disgust and weary . 2108.7238215035172
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
CHAPTER I . 226.77999763369792
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ? 1391.820951850617
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . 1898.9457102406543
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . 1068.4850079887876
Elizabeth hoped she had <UNK> him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 1475.4638935574585
There is nothing he would not do for her . " The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . 1543.3210094645774
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . 1252.262300720633
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more <UNK> , and less <UNK> than the other had ever seen him . 2161.5990377818503
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her <UNK> being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 1787.3777931000614
When the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a <UNK> to her mother ' s <UNK> for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . 1925.6718483566046
Bennet , who assured him with some <UNK> that they were very well able to keep a good <UNK> , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <UNK> . 1911.6446460422533
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose <UNK> of <UNK> support . 2196.111533846358
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go . 600.0246466576007
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were <UNK> the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . 2420.7607555287345
The Foundation is <UNK> to complying with the laws <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> donations in all states of the United States . 2152.9032744184665
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? " " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . 1809.1827136918519

in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 1311.321138610056
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . 737.702479395778
He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 1426.4532850242535
The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs . 561.042597533736
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 1637.107470623264
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different <UNK> ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . 2150.908110779004
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? 1799.9198557229881
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " I saw you look at me to day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . 1522.5181310303178
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . 952.8222266018589
Darcy may be guessed . 861.7390959796033
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley . 956.217427100611
He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . " " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . 1646.6707608301072
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 1928.922854311498
Gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . 955.3796641694364
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 2165.3107466559995
But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . 1637.3991729041536
I shall like it of all things . 609.8733654864028
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . 2340.7427640781884
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . 1548.4956558429437
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . 1774.553649042785
Mr . Collins was carefully <UNK> them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <UNK> them . 1609.6663162459538
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . 1263.6987187899583

In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels . 1926.189900445255
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . 1193.1399316789743
On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . 2125.568219152886
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . 1543.0866812650088
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . 1371.2742832882063
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room . 1284.5326965966465
I am impatient to see him . " " In point of <UNK> , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective . 1112.0349001783734
<UNK> him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her . 2267.8553263536232
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . " She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . 1495.2731197623818
" They will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . 1314.781172163409
I will think no more about him . " Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth . 1775.213913321743
I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . 1236.0590093797057
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the <UNK> , but of that I <UNK> . 2356.6930923892246
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty . 1120.041591717861
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 1546.9701290492271
The business was therefore soon settled . 699.6668038329888
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . 1157.403884501988
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , <UNK> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . 1924.8802716379053
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . 677.4800428824294
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . " Elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . 1084.4703546790847
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell . 1813.1397781808123
Society , I own , is necessary to me . 1118.3778896731844
In this <UNK> state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 2219.1262448621633
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her . 857.2784141764447
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so doubtful , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea . 2053.7063814890744
They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <UNK> <UNK> and head <UNK> there is not much the matter with me . 2358.4693444076165
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure . " The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs . 1923.9412689415258
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . 1688.386004010502
Many small donations to , are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the <UNK> . 2390.7982770097956
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and <UNK> , and talk and laugh all the way home . 1845.1734968532523
It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . 1479.0480291037843
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 1135.3602620626853
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 2282.6006397470464
Yet he knew to the contrary himself . 1064.277252629503
Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody ' s reserve , can be answerable for the event . 2410.4483650085917
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself . 2210.584871703276
Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 1644.9191607789596
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . 1423.1386649013375
dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . 1637.647205261002
It originated in Mrs . 244.86588555580076
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . 1145.932413058705
The supposition did not pain her . 553.006975738753
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 1304.4147931520247
But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! 786.0444231491978
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate . 1801.7667665205488
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . 1458.0909215510562
<UNK> since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 1575.4240291698598
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 1578.5869699984596
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . 745.0619815165389
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . 1135.573758293994
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . 1509.8251864635845
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill <UNK> of Lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . 2155.708537750176
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . " She was then proceeding to all the particulars of <UNK> , muslin , and <UNK> , and would shortly have <UNK> some very <UNK> orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted . 2704.249873288154
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . 1221.6655222012414
The dejection was almost universal . 703.1046619475284
She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . 1559.989638687134
<UNK> wore a happier aspect . 1647.624825205437
Oh , no . " " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . " " No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . " " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . " She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . 1386.6056866891386
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . " " And I certainly never shall give it . 1059.469460316289
They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . 890.7031912701724
They were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs . 1223.1638601159143
CHAPTER VI . 251.15965623927994
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . 1891.1599696190133
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . 1929.0792368961147
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? 609.127210431879
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . 1496.5925747920417
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . Bingley was <UNK> to Darcy by the easiness , openness , <UNK> of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . 2477.7297321023907
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr . Bennet , have you no more <UNK> <UNK> in which Lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " " I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs . 1423.9755217480415
Elizabeth merely <UNK> to him , without saying a word . 911.0569838478486
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 1180.8016895204573
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence . 1658.0325428125227
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . 922.454283432815
Annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs . 2037.916336929085
" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . 1389.3452117202037
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances and to have Mr . Collins instead ! 1345.156989738835
" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . " " Is my father in town ? " " Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . " " And have you heard from him often ? " " We have heard only once . 1350.1545610718158
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 1007.7563954530958
Younge was of course removed from her charge . 1273.536004333306
Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s sufferings . 1013.6694025278724
You cannot have been always at Longbourn . " Elizabeth looked surprised . 925.5481599034285
<UNK> recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be <UNK> . 2171.6395891582733
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned . 1984.0899446192404
CHAPTER XI . 237.11669479662504
" About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . " " Yes , " replied Wickham ; " his estate there is a noble one . 1274.28279455506
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 2006.2238692800702
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ' s <UNK> had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or <UNK> in him . 1882.4083749706367
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s foot <UNK> , that she said , ' Mr . Collins , you must marry . 1220.949654040839
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 2024.2415207245656
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 1117.7403339053994
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . 1704.9884645195796
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . 1307.413284768025
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 1236.1483998394117
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 443.7364563659856
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 605.5236048992409
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia . 1698.437922917675
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . 1238.1650601234996
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . 1571.1453369340404
Nobody wants him to come . 987.8973340021292
A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . 1261.782843172751
It adds even another motive . 688.9279623410418
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 2234.7890358504837
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his <UNK> were at the same time so vague and <UNK> , that her mother , though often <UNK> , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . 2060.001620549687
Good Heaven ! 374.63090626279103
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . 1392.164399058653
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 1091.455980312906
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 1601.8180398712686
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the <UNK> old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . 2353.6692792818717
But I confess they would have no charms for me . 733.2309098838949
Bennet was <UNK> in her acknowledgments . 855.7534915333144
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 1881.9292060922414
If the <UNK> of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . 2091.995323362071
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . 1152.969871950249
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 1758.8842517771818
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 1442.126805065697
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . 1364.0304627063767
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " Lydia declared herself satisfied . 1337.0506368942324
" I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . 2105.32855593226
" But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with <UNK> , and rob it of a few <UNK> <UNK> without his perceiving me . " The period of expectation was now <UNK> . 1676.6955184723806
She was humbled , she was grieved ; she <UNK> , though she hardly knew of what . 1347.9349214759711
" Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " I have , Sir . " " Very well . 747.4878926608387
His revenge would have been complete indeed . 731.2324789541555
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 2113.116998716062
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . 1711.1967850273484
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 850.1428150550021
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she <UNK> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . " Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . 1676.7485940809013
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 1763.5823386748966
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . 805.73318689288
In the hall they parted . 645.8157200323324
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . 1410.5691152598833
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ' s visit . 1903.9918099400363
I am most seriously displeased . " Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . 1213.3212446117684
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . 1680.5774732700645
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . 1279.3774054117448
Charles , when you <UNK> your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 1794.3095095490364
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does . 1362.7372875524431
" Can you come to morrow ? " Yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 1540.5872556941533
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away . 1434.8972009804436
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . " " I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want . " " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " No , indeed . 1092.6403324796784
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of <UNK> in that way . 1122.9188940804436
I do not deserve it . 198.11043754376445
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . 971.1396884320769
Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . 909.408050767279
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a <UNK> as that , it might be of essential consequence . 2045.887209396868
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her <UNK> . 2285.200403627491
and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! 1303.1296188541605
The visit was returned in due form . 885.7711740742102
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her <UNK> spirits , and of teaching her that her present <UNK> are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 1745.0506480750219
" He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived . 654.5257960243237
It is really too distressing . 438.55584052307665
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . 2077.2832490531337
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! 1852.3502415143187
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . 1623.8775624436175
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 1207.192908148158
Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a <UNK> season , made her feel that the <UNK> , <UNK> , most thread bare <UNK> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <UNK> . 2396.172306827038
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
To Mr . and Mrs . 150.40079936600415
It was all conjecture . " " What is it you mean ? " " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing . " " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . " " And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . 1202.0939514681115
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 1359.0994348156155
" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 1277.1962217189152
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . 1158.2836145038948
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 2015.5950005923003
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <UNK> of Mrs . 1327.8923499027378
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 1886.6617960194503
I did not think Mrs . 177.24847266994686
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that . 1620.4073044319643
No thanks to his gallantry for that . 990.6318546520736
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . 1119.6861577216955
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . 1772.644386587169
dear me ! 454.3649587731949
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish . 1375.1635173156674
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 1510.8603970856736
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 1631.333094553901
Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 1968.2268677123177
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . 1086.1403050541146
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . 1092.4148891908023
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> . 2409.944891011158
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement . 1041.258415659704
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is <UNK> the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken <UNK> , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . 1429.1781326568155
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . 1954.6710239217846
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . " From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . 1447.6089094369797
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . " " That is his notion of christian forgiveness ! 2029.5366637635443
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <UNK> from the marriage of her sisters . 1466.5853356486368
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . " " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <UNK> which other people may observe . 2201.572535677324
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged . 1545.9949872206873
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention . 1137.6182854070144
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . 1260.005751294887
" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? " said she . 696.5384714440902
CHAPTER IX . 237.11669479662504
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? 1422.6147564488483
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . 1042.809718536855
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . " " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . 1939.2009383235388
Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant <UNK> to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " I do not know . I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult . 1328.182154765146
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . " " I should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother . 1218.7397963187907
Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . 1967.7083507561892
I knew how it would be . 345.39298860594073
But , Lizzy ! 173.19969815467397
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . 1659.617157888518
" Of music ! 337.4687696530747
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . 1205.0762736154963
CHAPTER V . 251.15965623927994
<UNK> them next to your great uncle the judge . 2053.523291803864
There can be no love in all this . 747.6761675306102
" Oh ! 42.46667514260318
But your arts and <UNK> may , in a moment of <UNK> , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . 1902.662231814639
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 2098.2471039116003
how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would <UNK> you about to all the balls . 1750.575851290286
She then <UNK> again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . " " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . " " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something <UNK> <UNK> in the usual <UNK> of such a meeting . 2209.123478050235
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon . 1632.2729823266363
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . 1408.5982158521053
what has she to do with it ? 1168.8154333446591
" No ; but it must be done soon . " Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . 1732.7621437510754
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . 774.8577764143724
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 1069.2997404778935
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . 1615.0905886783767
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 2367.651728601794
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 1329.6499412273668
CHAPTER VIII . 237.11669479662504
CHAPTER XI . 237.11669479662504
CHAPTER I . 226.77999763369792
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she . 677.1823019331425
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . 925.9568830228218
<UNK> , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . 2358.9271055056993
Jane was not happy . 456.6756602913143
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? 829.6815502288799
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the <UNK> of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 2222.950690287362
" Oh ! 42.46667514260318
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . 1920.392215179699
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to <UNK> the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 1575.4139278584553
My feelings in every respect forbid it . 578.8194877228311
" I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . 975.1516196024577
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . 1347.6080232645047
Lord ! 249.95296134238674
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 2299.393539939824
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . 1978.2742410532217
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . 1784.9058311228807
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . 1548.2457145864769
" Do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; " that is rather singular . " " Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " <UNK> cards . 1002.7958756779814
What will Wickham say ? 571.3268625140618
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . 1318.590207764575
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give <UNK> confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr . Darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr . Darcy in a most infamous manner . 1658.3528994079197
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 1207.9892174998738
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! 1509.4192026431008
CHAPTER III . 226.77357108648664
" What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? 720.744929912526
" We can all plague and punish one another . 959.3553885346894
But are you pleased , Jane ? 839.1667154860319
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . 1269.5012420011503
If I were not afraid of judging <UNK> , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . 1482.8624188311044
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 1013.5891597873117
But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . " " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother . 1137.93444473251
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to <UNK> such pleasures . 2296.6244851227166
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . 1564.6584119097977
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as <UNK> <UNK> as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . 2172.287282042562
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as , by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . 1481.7640531451877
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . 1328.790225807304
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget ' had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ' Those were your words . 1838.071324262627
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . " " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the <UNK> manner which I see so many women ' s do . 1618.663424535599
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 1707.4068664248523
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . 1454.4016991075825
Now what have you to say ? " " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . " Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . 1771.91074528219
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . 1793.3508056665228
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . 1346.9033449004141
In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <UNK> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 1905.8390663819077
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . 1467.790138085105
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse . 1681.4394851838883
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from <UNK> in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death <UNK> of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and <UNK> as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly <UNK> her father not to let her go . 2420.9624627133176
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? 1433.1358511488022
If a woman <UNK> her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . 2107.1175033541713
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . 1794.0831798722916
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you . 1111.5717163867942
A few weeks , he believed . 896.9092964884101
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 1208.7073925617851
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so <UNK> that I cannot answer for being <UNK> . 2468.3796377305284
Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces . 1772.9580449860755
Lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 2251.0225092411865
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . 1358.8798144235793
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw <UNK> in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . 2175.4857498704278
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 1884.9598774025687
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 1940.7224062264218
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 1679.306590729911
CHAPTER XIV . 237.11669479662504
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 2212.4074303652883
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 1581.2017948712564
He has not an ill natured look . 763.8699441224495
Where shall you change horses ? Oh ! 1030.7508998289295
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . 945.8866444748342
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal . " " True . 1189.0638564710678
" Oh ! 42.46667514260318
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by <UNK> a <UNK> , or covering a <UNK> . 2619.094928057631
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you . 1172.6639770402396
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . 762.1968404320571
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 1631.226792644022
The possibility of Mr . Collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins ! 1740.7369012992451
Her report was highly favourable . 808.7236953768937
Elizabeth now began to <UNK> . 997.4342458989688
Besides , it will not much signify what one <UNK> this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . " " Are they indeed ? " cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . 1689.357830589105
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being <UNK> by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . 2370.996060583546
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 2477.9154854242474
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . " " This is not to be borne . 932.8922852476128
You see how continually we are engaged there . 924.3271025404142
You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in <UNK> those kind of schemes , and <UNK> a person of their <UNK> contempt . 2397.3149180293303
I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . 889.467309683699
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . 1599.3145381590593
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
Mr . Darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . 362.4767920969731
It is unaccountable ! 234.1685864783198
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 2126.7115959445955
<UNK> , <UNK> , . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations . 2643.3824952505643
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas . 2610.0333304832866
Bennet ' s <UNK> looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . 1342.2573889669702
CHAPTER XVI . 237.11669479662504
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy ' s regard . " " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? " " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . " " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy . 971.5265329573919
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . " " What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? 1643.0970874551042
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . 1770.1671702940075
I appeal to Mr . Darcy but let me not interrupt you , Sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the <UNK> converse of that young lady , whose <UNK> eyes are also <UNK> me . " The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 2277.841641438749
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 1159.3389890910323
how he must have felt it ! " " I never saw any one so shocked . 1035.4462362501044
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of <UNK> , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . 2275.03386066869
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 761.1295294814672
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . 1106.9349020894801
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . " " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . " " In <UNK> your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were <UNK> . 1515.3469136462354
Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . 1247.970577023868
Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . 1493.6281103863387
" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . 1291.1349727484353
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 1043.7597944765766
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . 1370.552114435263
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . 1758.447314580505
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 2414.004307046076
He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? 1311.3699306966812
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . 1510.1507520896726
And then when we came away it was such fun ! 1113.9963980934767
The <UNK> <UNK> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have . 1872.587148438407
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 1928.0841544151767
Gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . 1607.8941457810308
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
They have at least that advantage . " " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . 1221.0901894865247
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . 1676.5667923998546
There can be no occasion for your going so soon . 925.5949195779835
" Wickham so very bad ! 629.1906933032275
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 966.4302318283263
But when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ' s <UNK> all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 2367.6240545827854
Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . 1906.6425296333603
I believe I have now told you every thing . 725.4799905024955
My father , however , is partial to Mr . Wickham . 512.7935033048577
I am so happy . 204.18873912081068
no , no , this is not likely . 1146.6138778131465
I never saw such a long <UNK> in my life . 781.3945603837486
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . 1588.2919035854857
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 2259.428326913047
How are you all ? " " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 1541.2677703890586
<UNK> was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . 1977.6739826453465
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <UNK> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . 2272.4463849892463
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged <UNK> of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . 2515.2793646008276
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . 1873.8389210792889
I am not equal to it . 215.92879983793108
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . 1461.6247195712015
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 1926.1627240392831
I do not trust my own partiality . 523.3616138331436
All field <UNK> were over . 1095.5410483415685
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of <UNK> from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a <UNK> horse . 2243.26899357879
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . 2301.323101323593
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever . " Darcy was fixed in astonishment . 1675.9187877861323
Bennet , having <UNK> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . 2303.8813715076767
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . 1626.5846358749757
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . 1594.7200515731074
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . 1796.3002282820617
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <UNK> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . 2397.2571805783577
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . " Elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! 1588.884926539302
With many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs . 1960.8207551037167
Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . 980.5569273695328
Perhaps I am not doing her justice . 891.8944440903944
GARDINER . " " Is it possible ! " cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . 741.522107662378
" I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . " " Not at all , " he replied ; " they were <UNK> by the exercise . " A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . 1059.3686154243821
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . " <UNK> by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did . 2043.0881902358642
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge . 1755.2820304292034
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 2056.1540605778428
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 2410.7165509232486
They <UNK> as expeditiously as possible ; and <UNK> one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day . 1948.9913681331377
You know I have . 408.8995670398116
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . 2131.39884559518
It is a pity they are not handsome ! 558.2466094003605
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 1317.8040931527244
How are they even to be discovered ? 1096.1598988419535
A clergyman like you must marry . <UNK> properly , chuse a <UNK> for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . 2736.496685139513
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . " " You are over <UNK> surely . 1170.699683470201
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or <UNK> distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more <UNK> blind . 2593.2313622207134
" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of <UNK> in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ' s regard for me . 1403.9186170269031
On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . 1892.225427975864
He is come Mr . Bingley is come . He is , indeed . 931.8582464107216
<UNK> and <UNK> I can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart . 2508.1960387115782
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise . 2659.2144379454508
But who was your mother ? 666.6764131793403
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . 673.0350119022644
Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , <UNK> exclaimed , " Good Lord ! 1935.9045201627441
She now lost every expectation of pleasure . 802.0961789537597
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <UNK> with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 1590.304063778308
You have employed your time much better . 645.908885775319
Collins knew not what to make of him . 634.538500260005
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
It is admirable ! " Elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 1421.863348543716
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . 1160.179371691644
<UNK> , teazing , man ! 1510.9321476634047
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . 2057.4657760474092
But that is nothing to us . 452.4262689410562
She will follow wherever Lydia leads . 734.6260492508552
Do not let us quarrel about the past . 1204.0397450735115
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 1493.9580242631691
They are all for what they can get . 998.9909744140189
So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 1840.0153122257334
But these things happen so often ! 801.9095527535486
I am sick of them all . 314.54945958353466
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F . 1504.5219657375883
They were hopeless of remedy . 564.4147535721003
Mr . Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . 924.8330232114224
But at length , by Elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that <UNK> which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the <UNK> . 2079.96214010722

It <UNK> , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . 2027.3292995105444
" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? " " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . " " La ! " replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . 1269.4002093962001

From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an <UNK> chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . 1700.2550259470136
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . 1006.7267966166721
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . 2657.6612272873376

But still he would be her husband .

and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . " " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . 1327.6083824669968
Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 2031.6577385258038
We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . 1727.338714862116
He takes them now for people of fashion . " The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she <UNK> a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his <UNK> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . 2087.927136307309
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . 1561.8099657699001
She directly replied , " You need not be frightened . 796.8364398878955
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane . 1691.5576895225636
I am afraid you will be angry . " " My dearest sister , now be be serious . 746.3149573275133

To no creature had it been revealed , where <UNK> was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 2241.127268303632
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 1580.176975465778

If , indeed , it should be so ! 700.7026925645425
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <UNK> for Mr . Darcy ' s pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham . 2293.5799673971287
It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . 1400.4330354620965

He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not <UNK> , but haughty . 1954.8600044027228
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . 983.6041189841291

CHAPTER IV . 272.3755572552172
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . " Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of <UNK> such reflections . 2219.323569800418
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be <UNK> into it ? " " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to <UNK> with rather more <UNK> the degree of importance which is to <UNK> to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . 2526.0281578966974
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . 1708.3750593657232
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were <UNK> of dejection . 2054.918440614488
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? " " One of them does . " " Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . 2231.3720229567816
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and <UNK> the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 2415.0705315339696
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 1893.8756473173105
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 2227.601330210722
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 1195.6672055369702
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be <UNK> to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a <UNK> nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . 2563.025745786722

Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . 698.8811468937877
" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . 776.9626176969634
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <UNK> of a bad day . 1697.9613870927615
Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 1657.1133997078252
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . 1335.9094470597124
I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . " Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . 1743.2842852094916
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh . 361.41831891315644
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild <UNK> of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . 2315.0140677089616

And is it really true ? 775.484272426486
When the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , <UNK> her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment <UNK> . 2114.4967087087575
Does he know his real character ? " " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . 1414.6078693658799
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . 1793.5717916750552
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . 1703.9036437696975
The particulars , I reserve till we meet . 1056.7997637779304
Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " This walk is not wide enough for our party . 1087.946694142894
Not handsome enough to dance with ! 835.9805737359966
These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 2182.613884515418
An union of a different tendency , and <UNK> the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . 2034.3567929787314
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 2102.368639616244
" I am sure there is not on his . 414.2008567484847
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 2225.2076994796607
" Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 1310.3232697624999
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . 1402.9934931194966
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 1217.251812427048
" He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . 1664.5493861111345
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . 2223.751454363863
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . 821.979060510017
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! 1659.723801057053
Miss Lucas is married and settled . 829.8569840875746
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 1627.3316998831992
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! How much of good or evil must be done by him ! 2215.1876622032887
But I dare not hope it . 349.79057797244343
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . 892.6039426523594
They were ignorant , idle , and vain . 757.8050252435523
Who are your uncles and <UNK> ? 1517.1928911619232
Bennet thus began the <UNK> conversation . " Oh ! 861.9574909563095
who attended to you ? 758.1017058539092
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 2400.3456351083023
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . 1717.443529094108
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon <UNK> deliberation , you find that the misery of <UNK> his two sisters is more than <UNK> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . " " How can you talk so ? " said Jane <UNK> smiling , " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . " " I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . " " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 1781.804425606005
" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently . 1102.9674642426394
Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 1294.6089010283656
But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! 1678.184539274847
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . 1194.432342534583
I quite forgot ! 355.62294191698857
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the per <UNK> . 2249.4041400478122
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my <UNK> . " " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . 1508.8005079378784
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F . 696.138176917035
Elizabeth silently attended her . 359.83665664668797
Why does she not come in ? " " Oh ! 541.0097246369033
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . 1296.734723376534
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 1082.4759809985846
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . 1992.154041400052
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child . 954.2281748096617
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking . 1371.7863193370156
I ought not to have said a word about it . 588.1720594474077
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! 1777.3405837175314

A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern . 1306.7760981460876
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 1200.3706170889388
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were <UNK> to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . 2290.1030465019476
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they <UNK> . 1282.293114061881
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " There can be no doubt of that . 1562.2254323542882
Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 1622.5181074880245
In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . 769.4458715497108

He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months . 1682.5490619555112
nonsense , how can you talk so ! 1096.8133963620846
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . 911.3545735795827
" I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she . 373.75070028967076
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over <UNK> evils , or <UNK> them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . 2017.5649127056106
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! 1412.418840213764
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 1876.561148217513
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . " " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " And how impossible in others ! " " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? " " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . 1521.9914661744044
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . 1363.1076045638601
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North . 1591.1125583960124
Mr . Darcy was <UNK> him with <UNK> wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . 1370.130585018651
The second began . 352.54479300556625
As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . 1349.1907214195471
She turned from sister to sister , <UNK> their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . 1739.441797855002
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . 1316.0045498105872
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . 1111.350330166715
Her ladyship was highly incensed . 721.2671294160467
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . 1831.317869845664
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away . 1444.5622574491479
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it . 1154.9720290286984
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 1953.9890574818166
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . 881.3694416849814
Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . 1372.944297278956
Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? 2449.4015277879084
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest . 1915.611757905084
Kitty <UNK> and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . 1766.2866341065273
This letter is from Mr . Collins . " " From Mr . Collins ! 608.779603152653
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 1981.8395300346467
You shall hear what she says . " She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . Hurst had a house . 2150.6234126385475
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . 1404.2328144101666
My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them . 1317.869120603223
But I must tell you how it went off . 690.8877684128328
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . " Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . 1463.539028887277
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . 1669.844817764156
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . " Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less <UNK> of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too <UNK> by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . 2037.2116773610107
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> ! 1369.6335735376063
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . 2066.9812280371775
But you know married women have never much time for writing . 1295.9159273414475
Bennet ' s <UNK> was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter . 1429.5619593154954
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 2262.0381405091916
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 1833.0525535593752
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
What a contrast between him and his friend ! 956.9973158172735
Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach . 2075.694173556158
To Mr . Bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 1902.2109341654827
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such <UNK> sisters , home could not be <UNK> , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake . 2149.0911957433354
I know you will contrive it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . 1892.8801751878539
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . 849.046933361832
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with <UNK> all the <UNK> explanations . 1990.2400447652192
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s <UNK> name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father ' s estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think . 2170.47991724169
He had to be sure done much . 533.0218987575412
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . 1978.8892403732586
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . 1289.427084357847
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . 879.8776391636685
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . 1058.4788439321596
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . 2025.8971871365404
I can hardly write for laughing . 628.6982955891019
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ? 1430.7964834613376
This was agreed to , and Mrs . 377.22722489449825
Miss Darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . 476.9622768301463
CHAPTER X . 237.11669479662504
Mr . Darcy may <UNK> himself . " " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried Elizabeth . 463.49619100951907
He drew a chair near her . 564.4018859698377
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ' s folly . " " Indeed you are mistaken . 1626.7720913175165
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <UNK> circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her <UNK> and steady candour always <UNK> for <UNK> , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 2467.093471439722
He is so excessively handsome ! 528.8122022437126
Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . 1283.282214640592
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . 1134.03950173043
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! 1510.1759617892344
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an <UNK> man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a <UNK> , had nothing to say to her . 1801.204477030418
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw . 691.8338646717134
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 2490.7207621863918
Gardiner . 126.27619172372152
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much . 1531.9681048437214
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and <UNK> every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the <UNK> of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 2578.4453208956384
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another . 2114.6216654558384
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <UNK> what <UNK> felicity really was . 1754.90331682827
CHAPTER II . 226.77357108648664
She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 1715.7458613192653
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe . 1465.4730824945455
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . 1220.1781950974296
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 1643.9661790731113
Consider Mr . Collins ' s respectability , and Charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . 1173.9307109471247
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . 2138.499316076317
Bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . 1082.926198730527
A house in town ! 689.45532251947
" It must not be thought of . 520.9625792056
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . 1939.9171553340584
They contained no actual <UNK> , nor was there any <UNK> of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 2243.7590040405444
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 1848.4247514198578
I only hope they may have half my good luck . 1124.4444590993432
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . 1366.6108108751248
Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual <UNK> ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the <UNK> of his thoughts . 2510.3693186749374
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <UNK> them . 1091.2248724836602
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 1398.890357703865
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " " You may as well call it impertinence at once . 1558.9872971397024
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted <UNK> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <UNK> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . 2534.6118750979517
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been <UNK> , and it had actually been <UNK> that Colonel Forster was going to be married . 2578.305520141197
The journey would moreover give her a <UNK> at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . 1459.4344499123345
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit . 2078.525904782024
CHAPTER XVIII . 272.3755572552172
why is not every body as happy ? " Elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . 2213.1378219273765
She comes to us to day . 606.3050734252477
Is not it so , Mrs . 479.58370288680806
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 901.1247174812157
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy . 672.348001667467
She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa . 906.1347601766863
Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her . 1443.8267545388348
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 940.2526312325357
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . 1373.4395181397413
It would be such a <UNK> scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . 1040.0081160615616
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . 2141.3102015888435
" How could you begin ? " said she . 477.10896831954307
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 1567.2998871378013
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . " To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . 2051.665272000681
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . 1525.4015887012865
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 1239.4947727926437
You refuse to <UNK> the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . 1713.5604956475097
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day <UNK> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . 2153.9219266196696
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . 1320.2463793807303
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house . 1477.477166791933
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent . 1088.4365300016195
It will not do . 317.41557675109834
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . 2004.8665507010364
Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c . 1010.2138333744476
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 1566.363895540602
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals . 1039.4287624146523
They are gone off together from Brighton . 745.7532207879646
I will only add , God bless you . 639.6365985162153
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 1876.0171028364941
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected . 1555.3148339618806
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 1919.6605615952806
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 1485.9210542418086
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . 964.6614505745918
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his <UNK> to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm . 1560.5383732695625
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . 1211.1109942169705
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
But , alas ! 243.58717409062155
I remain , dear sir , with <UNK> compliments to your lady and daughters , your well <UNK> and friend , <UNK> <UNK> . " " At four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he <UNK> up the letter . 1810.0455986315571
A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it <UNK> from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . 1978.0858306419386
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 1410.7539806685877
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 1236.1981235773665
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 1855.3460342703836
I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 1234.4439812025269
CHAPTER XIII . 272.3755572552172
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 1906.3829463798656
" ' Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much . 787.6063784289321
Most earnestly did she <UNK> to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . 2142.186545384319
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr . Wickham . 1331.9502852642124
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . " " And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the <UNK> of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! 1849.6112341775186
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs . 727.128750609844
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 1728.1222949938135
But papa is so disagreeable . " " A little <UNK> bathing would set me up for ever . " " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty . 1306.7928825997026
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . 2557.8908472914713
He readily agreed to it . 383.6662415094552
I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . 929.0482872427767
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . 1655.2206496234683
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 1217.5392807163614
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . 1319.3421764660163
One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 2011.7059704996198
yes . 245.96984492356904
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . 1089.1488720959487
The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 953.8253406912283
c . " Mr . Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . 1712.7088844939537
On Saturday he came again . 617.0873602742446
Is not general incivility the very <UNK> of love ? " " Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . 1680.633218630889
Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . 1097.412955888593
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . 1997.7840429773808
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " CHAPTER XVIII . 1043.0063558611141
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 1721.1485717746905
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . 1534.8643648818397
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr . Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . 1582.1712304376392
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months . 2101.453561206614
Four nieces of Mrs . 337.3136905679031
At present I will say nothing about it . " " You are quite right . 592.238178326774
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present <UNK> of good will are highly <UNK> , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . 2415.1834394154566
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 1790.3500169707927
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 2001.6111778184975
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs . 1184.7727359495436
She is unfortunately of a sickly <UNK> , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who <UNK> her education , and who still <UNK> with them . 2164.4535844268626
How I long to see her ! 710.5699301889222
At such a distance as that , you know , things are <UNK> misrepresented . " " Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips . 1332.8288932619585
Not like the wild young men now a days , who think of nothing but themselves . 1671.6253851834954
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? 1009.7848755151333
" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . 607.3969739121957
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <UNK> and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " Wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of accents , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right . 2368.404601762419
Jenkinson , who lives with them . 647.6050730747701
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . 1871.9781979840916
CHAPTER XV . 237.11669479662504
Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . 379.56448308806785
I was ready to die of laughter . 672.790926348347
I dearly love a laugh . " " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . 804.0440566273293
Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs . 1396.3773521165376
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia . 1218.6054924445384
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be <UNK> . 1642.5741401460893
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia ' s leaving home . 1386.149177204779
Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . 1468.6373669128398
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can <UNK> so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most <UNK> to a <UNK> ' s mind . 2797.5788984119426
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her <UNK> , by dwelling on them . 881.7619334453854
that abominable Mr . Darcy ! My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to <UNK> it . 1379.8286184545607
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 1386.5072408793735
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? " Nothing less than the complaisance of a <UNK> could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most <UNK> courtesy . 2312.8149889106194
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? " " Yes ; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . 1402.4659094453743
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 2003.849323284184
" I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . " " Perhaps I do . 1056.3099336698835
She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most <UNK> by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . 1347.3548646887832
Collins , you must send a servant with them . 643.8408310612119
The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in <UNK> and <UNK> , and the evening at one of the <UNK> . 1863.6489519771837
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 2318.261175930254
Not that I care about it , though . 919.1313468422775
His character was to speak for itself . 892.3733446880201
I cannot understand it . 200.79708485332216
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else ! 708.8251650194036
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 2401.9902237454307
It was agreed to . 261.7697339277022
Collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too . 1866.6335348824762
Such was Miss Lucas ' s scheme ; and <UNK> were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . 1956.773436006573
I will leave him to himself . " In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . 1601.7403917824747
Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . 468.5964455194136
Elizabeth felt Jane ' s pleasure . 560.4628874502973
You must not disappoint your father . " " My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . " " Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . " " Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . 1056.4003508273197
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . 1052.7944707131437
" While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr . Bingley . " " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife . 727.3396063953775
There is one point , on which I want your advice . 1049.185892251763
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . 162.3950311696316
" Oh ! 42.46667514260318
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 498.56294154115506
When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . 1456.5061527067398
This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . 1651.7486826886466
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <UNK> by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . 1908.6958623287665
What are we to do ! " would they often <UNK> in the bitterness of <UNK> . 2315.092013774127
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! 1468.3014442631293
<UNK> as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> . 2469.677248211721
" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! 1071.6014115228093
He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . " " Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . " He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . 1992.196471649094
At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s <UNK> him entirely , for she was a most determined <UNK> ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making <UNK> and exclaiming after <UNK> , to have attention for any one in particular . 2582.566682101115
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . 1553.8715737655407
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ? 983.6603415960108
Every thing <UNK> what is strong already . 1318.714522954471
Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . 1030.4437154892807
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . 1938.4502970808749
" Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . 135.7655634367504
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the <UNK> light , seemed most improbable . 2287.7252669834297
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . 1588.3620365335562
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a <UNK> ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 2148.6645392145383
That is the place to get husbands . 1039.2881304281964
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . " " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . 1303.7352073276516
Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . 1541.4045741747861
With the <UNK> concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 2019.2071322986
Oh , Lord ! 401.0639139032106
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 1410.681810560502
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <UNK> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 2223.4066088461173
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 1592.963126806309
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <UNK> , distance becomes no evil . 2222.265803135473
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . 1031.5687082044187
<UNK> as she was to admit an idea so <UNK> of Jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the <UNK> of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . 2096.8901922291984
Long . 222.30602727260205
and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! 1284.5803795049158
" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said Mr . Gardiner . 791.6853065038054
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh ! 991.1097980854619
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . " Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . 1593.250804821054
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . 1742.2055666557278
At length however Mrs . 262.89595619443764
CHAPTER X . 237.11669479662504
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . 1846.4859174288506
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to <UNK> from the <UNK> qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . 2500.2279494584336
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . " " Indeed ! " " Yes the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> . 1810.9277407494055
" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . 1075.4602567742584
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 1103.5674472285139
They entered it in one of its <UNK> points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , <UNK> over a wide extent . 2306.3549422852684
YOU AGREE THAT YOU <UNK> NO <UNK> FOR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . F . . YOU AGREE THAT THE <UNK> , THE <UNK> <UNK> , AND ANY <UNK> <UNK> THIS <UNK> <UNK> NOT <UNK> <UNK> TO YOU FOR <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> DAMAGES <UNK> <UNK> YOU <UNK> <UNK> OF THE <UNK> OF <UNK> <UNK> . 5135.9853197377415
And his behaviour , so <UNK> altered , what could it mean ? 1807.5869996308747
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane . 1226.1646486704403
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . 2013.1028950694824
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in <UNK> affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? 1445.7184137430875
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <UNK> ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 2164.4644032368637
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother How is she ? 1231.2740449389644
The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who <UNK> it , were familiar to them . 1929.7341429094013
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . 1390.907957323111
" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . 1387.9100539817891
The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood . 1679.479682473407
" Then , who taught you ? 598.3263021178527
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . 661.2198053360121
" I should never have said Mrs . 219.28265565156318
<UNK> to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax <UNK> to the full extent permitted by U . S . federal laws and your state ' s laws . 2164.3094377668576
She had been <UNK> pleased to approve of both the <UNK> , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . 1487.4021873976194
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . 1347.590328218325
Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority . 2050.6803646360013
What do I not owe you ! 851.6404081160321
It was at Sir William Lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . 891.621436588318
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it . 942.4526207655255
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <UNK> your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter . 2037.6424158694813
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 923.028041713493
He is perfectly amiable . 347.8201753581497
You know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . 1118.0790392789668
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 1987.2149165179226
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of inviting him . " " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . 1463.8768877645234
" You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . 1545.1224609825065
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 1331.3667058025087
Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 1827.0938193989277
Mr . and Mrs . 55.85036198951862
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 1415.471021596758
She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . 1055.1506118093462
Every kind of pride must <UNK> from the connection . 1647.8391216403788
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 405.4019270285581
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . 1584.7135914963762
Mr . Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . 1305.6751744685948
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . 1670.6496337705337
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 839.5629038183295
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the coachman ' s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs . 2005.7244932424983
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 1640.7976148671758
was not a man to be trusted . 1113.1482887441227
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well . 1079.6124544427885
There ' s for you ! 663.2372417403291
" I found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr . Darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . " She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . 1750.377398406105
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 2003.2439746088257
Bennet . " My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received <UNK> at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right <UNK> Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose <UNK> and <UNK> has preferred me to the valuable <UNK> of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <UNK> myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those <UNK> and <UNK> which are <UNK> by the <UNK> of England . 2906.2415034613714
My dear Mr . Bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? 598.2085577489635
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes <UNK> , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . 1869.9264762819103
The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion . 1277.9332237618921
" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . 686.0848282614661
They will ruin your happiness . 528.5679722705928
Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . " CHAPTER XIII . 1443.7861182807007
A regard for the <UNK> would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . 2125.8161739286425
Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described . 922.1927589027507
He has more to give . 471.9504300208098
You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs . 512.6999048163725
yes ; there is nothing in that . 949.4943647978814
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . 1687.1621846530254
" You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . 1132.8433691514606
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . 1809.279245111105
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my <UNK> and <UNK> are not usually <UNK> by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of <UNK> ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . Pardon me . It pains me to offend you . 2723.757077966428
<UNK> Kitty ! 1043.5311613108138
" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! 1068.5506660199367
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well . 779.6113816544083
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . 1994.1736349944033
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 1225.2527721886029
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . 1437.3304488748224
Let me hear from you very soon . 775.6521866835798
" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . 627.2556071874299
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . 1436.739145994483
yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . 1729.0922145515544
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of <UNK> . " He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . 1921.6632548943735
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? " " Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . 1655.9795970973782
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . 1603.445710364873
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane . 904.513887354188
Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 1505.482448140489
There is a mixture of <UNK> and self importance in his letter , which promises well . 1351.8231408788965
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . 1516.8724520989454
" You forget that I have made no answer . 461.98191826483554
These are <UNK> , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . 1848.888276021226
I shall never forget her appearance this morning . 564.9352588146525
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <UNK> , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 2126.2802006070788
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . 1444.2329573964894
Collins and myself sincerely <UNK> with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the <UNK> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 2391.540925469451
And it was settled that we should all be there by <UNK> o ' clock . 1606.5112029595061
" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s <UNK> in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . 1817.7926702115444
Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . 1159.696958569953
Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general <UNK> , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . 2059.6940540999058
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 570.9600351914814
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . 752.7196206032744
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . 1560.2786729647464
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> . 1656.4924651424485
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 1148.5799725466459
But I knew I should persuade you at last . 715.1769398621497
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 1624.4944912624856
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 1998.0957958575623
But there are two things that I want very much to know one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . " " <UNK> ! 1960.9474645380765
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My <UNK> were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte . 1944.981942610691
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater <UNK> concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being <UNK> by <UNK> , <UNK> inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . 2780.4765584075717
Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 2006.9895245621528
I think I have heard you say that you know them . " " I know them a little . 775.7686226914194
That lady I suppose is your mother . " Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . 1182.1725759963808
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year . 2127.7294249704883
Her answer , therefore , was not <UNK> , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . 1416.7140794573772

Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and <UNK> . 1718.5134704728669
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 1585.1312440375598
<UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 1751.363795361381
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . 673.4718147159363
" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be <UNK> , for <UNK> I must call it . " " It is wonderful , " replied Wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 1880.0889142763947
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . " Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . 1305.8424192570603
" What can be the meaning of this ! " said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone . 820.8626010234104
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , <UNK> over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in <UNK> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 2109.0979896782424
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " I have just received your letter , and shall <UNK> this whole morning to answering it , as I <UNK> that a little writing will not <UNK> what I have to tell you . 1876.1840204335933
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 1141.3902345176239
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . 1260.8125496156388
Bennet was quite in the <UNK> . 821.9109264299495
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . 1183.3252621026254
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good <UNK> engaged Mr . Collins ' s conversation to herself . 1267.1612640105284
My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . 2058.0034145539016
His disposition must be dreadful . " " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . " Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from <UNK> , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! " " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; <UNK> of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same <UNK> care . 2203.1005746562187
How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . 1124.6509121702113
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . 1085.0214544651326
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . 1311.1183204825998
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . 2099.9064254532996
And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from <UNK> . 1384.519838443279
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! 1620.19456282488
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . 1083.2012888153176
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 1878.8968390486818
She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . 1585.6093627595105
I am not <UNK> you know . 376.4516930873526
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 1501.913883416628
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 2102.270401903718
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . 1438.1946647617265
<UNK> had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and <UNK> her disgust of Mr . Collins . 1682.3191118240497
Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 1103.3950955791465
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 1720.3706652858832
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn house . 1457.7097698210353
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 1285.949885446059
But if I go on , I shall <UNK> you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . 1593.6430204031346
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . 1375.3978227452615
Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began . 1807.5204764783505
Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day . 1649.0871471995129
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 1969.0015115340864
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . " The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they <UNK> satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had <UNK> Mrs . 1837.7985246316473
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should <UNK> . 1444.5427850923763
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . 1667.7136274984928
They had frequently been staying with her in town . 866.9434659362395
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 705.1284010848817
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 1193.2934118288447
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 2139.141737760069
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 1070.719155026363
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . " " I am , " said he , with a firm voice . 683.0903041667113
" Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? 1283.7055367923074
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . 1793.8449235639941
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1655.450402719953
The <UNK> would be spoilt by <UNK> a fourth . 1703.7842443603415
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . " " I see no occasion for that . 1008.4263461312759
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . <UNK> staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . 2098.0193558737647
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . 1907.4562749496588
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund . 1846.1802628523005
But let me advise you to think better of it . 689.8121330860938
Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . 1333.392435761407
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 2078.3271453256334
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . 910.5638666299319
" Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . " " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . " " Oh ! 850.5194800116775
Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a <UNK> over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was <UNK> Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <UNK> . 1817.3714598253414
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . 2144.7567303718383
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . 1088.7447075628559
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party . 1115.394810898542
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 1727.3644923527925
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . 2058.5617830577244
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . 1257.6022953346337
You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg tm works . 1012.6664916752519
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . " " Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . 1527.3547258327897
" Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . 801.5575628006368
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in <UNK> to the proposal before him . 1535.584521484659
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . 898.2127392704896
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to <UNK> this estate after the death of your honoured father , who , however , may live many years longer , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . 1954.2430436566196
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . " Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire . 2023.3018935540604
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 1560.6866792135077
My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . 1534.3128991589779
" Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . 1549.4983047988349
Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . 1261.5800255541699
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 2722.983192605333
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! " cried Elizabeth when she had finished it . 984.4378659462004
" I never heard any thing so abominable . 555.6728679895526
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <UNK> , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her <UNK> and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , Lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . 2247.8902559253465
" You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . " " I should be sorry indeed , if it were . 1120.3991889539186
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . 1875.5470338080556
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . " " If I were as rich as Mr . Darcy , " cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , " I should not care how proud I was . 1526.5036728758698
<UNK> has she condescended to give me her opinion <UNK> too ! on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our <UNK> at quadrille , while Mrs . 2224.919390929927
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her <UNK> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . 2161.754925771969
Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , <UNK> him I believe very early in life . 1850.9388889482689
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 2199.9817994784266
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? 1728.2809121888179
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 1294.800646143247
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . 1867.1298402420357
And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined . 1768.3759691869147
What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a <UNK> of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . " " Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . " " And what arts did he use to separate them ? " " He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling . 2019.2226126676169
" Yet why did he come ? " She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . 1613.615480176472
<UNK> as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . 2022.5179567720963
But pride where there is a real <UNK> of mind , pride will be always under good <UNK> . " Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . 2120.836061319421
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 2175.5824804233334
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . 2137.7286702848346
For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently . 1517.4004787576705
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 1931.9798517555412
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 1910.7387211664807
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . 2000.5131360223938
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . 2224.032416061183
The party did not supply much conversation . 836.7574305599178

The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the <UNK> of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . 1999.9521455661275
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at Longbourn . 1904.3808306643484
It is of all subjects my delight . 647.1326925494124
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a <UNK> space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . 1845.5232582272356
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . 952.1059527885708
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . 1124.1736643602733
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . 1128.8742746754183

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . 1689.0506229721277
My fingers wait your orders . " " Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . " " Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1261.761173062211
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . 1541.5549744711175
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern <UNK> , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . 2200.2204795086786
I guessed as much . " And though he exclaimed at the <UNK> , she found that it had been pretty much the case . 1741.5940724138413
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the <UNK> of a considerable <UNK> , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . 2551.554475428697

They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . 1282.3717963138997
Pemberley was now Georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . 2006.5931016938594

We must not all expect Jane ' s good fortune . " " True , " said Mr .

" And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 1272.0682515379287

A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 2866.5042557038346
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . 771.2346277021137
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . 2073.400130629005
" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried Jane . 830.2023380300385
Will you come and see me ? " " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . " " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . 1036.7545837464497

The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . 1804.0843027334618

With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and <UNK> pass away . 2496.062650368995
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 1596.8653439864875
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . 911.9658863785512
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 911.0756775382239

For your sake , " turning to Charlotte , " I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for <UNK> estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh ' s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? " " A little . " " Oh ! 1421.136767396845

When they were all in the drawing room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . 1619.545888369045
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added <UNK> to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be <UNK> . 2239.8873761132836

It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 1369.4587659749088
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in <UNK> it after this explanation . " Mr . Darcy , who was <UNK> against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . 2048.477519766264
Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their <UNK> their income . 1584.9503458904255

She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . 1152.6740616484437
But his pride , his abominable pride , his <UNK> avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in <UNK> , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . 2100.3249777851174
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him . 813.4663794373187
" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam . 2298.4786370714137
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband . 1756.422924569539
She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 1309.9072643539575
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . 1760.5478155602395
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she <UNK> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . " Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . Wickham ' s attentions . 2019.154168161315
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? 1039.1210210635504
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . " " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? " " Dearest Jane ! 1900.0602409640576
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile it was decided . 1809.2566695180415
Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . " Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . 1538.4245890896057
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . 1781.191678392459
" When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! I who knew what he was . 1235.7596839598098
She will be down in a moment I dare say . " He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 1430.1300656899136

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 1701.3269893431827
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 2599.3706765208412
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies . 1383.562454167969
At length Darcy spoke , and in a <UNK> manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . " " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with <UNK> , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . " Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . 1886.051243592881
But slyness seems the fashion . 666.2872870803533
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . 1166.3049251977964

" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living . 841.0901222292401
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ? 2349.621388125453
Let us hope for better things . 863.5664562450094
I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the <UNK> . 1304.0971099162075

Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . 2029.1727422055146
" To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . 1285.4299462830045
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 1597.97800658272
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <UNK> shewn . 2360.7070529132066

When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 1951.9887067286409
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . " " To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 1418.2016302299073
What are you telling Miss Bennet ? 878.6327652582771
Who could about such a <UNK> little <UNK> thing ? " Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <UNK> and fancied liberal ! 2858.5963471786727
I can recal nothing worse . 521.0805549979372
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . 1357.0319873245169
Indeed he has no improper pride . 1161.9118957192775
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 1379.321395949352
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 1492.0004013039495
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . 1307.1885669698495
" He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . 1351.6319129062713
In understanding Darcy was the superior . 918.4469616494977
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . " " I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 1886.6110350889908
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> . 1605.015676464411

He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention . 1232.1109388792397
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette . 1243.892051547127
In <UNK> lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <UNK> in this interference . 1526.5336640517517
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus <UNK> my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to <UNK> your authority in my behalf . 1974.6229400106151
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 1656.791796248368
Of this she was perfectly <UNK> ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . 2218.0760199863794
" I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham . 787.6216454294764
" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she . 463.1673767864945
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . 1535.502657215466
We seem to have been designed for each other . " Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she <UNK> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . 1803.945354815822
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a <UNK> fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered <UNK> to the repeated <UNK> of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 2211.6466306577536
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 1763.4698490481874
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left <UNK> , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . 2018.422269850949
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other . 1264.8607771417373
The others have been gone on to <UNK> , these three weeks . " She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . 1731.7952550066632
What will become of me . 516.3996465703705
It became her turn to listen . 826.1119069020085

" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 1289.0306193874287

Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . 395.7722515858578
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . 2027.0019287452772
But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . 1242.8503348673444
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . 1344.1389191650267
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before . 1389.2709891704794

His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . 1173.3891338686515
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . 442.171918191431
" <UNK> . 367.408620591202
Yes , yes . 519.0493127897153
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 2133.1305518960608
She saw with the <UNK> eye of fancy , the <UNK> of that gay bathing place covered with officers . 2149.4935199528236
Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 1517.7170025558341
I was uncomfortable enough . 272.30567756605024
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 1167.4718764258998
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . " " <UNK> out , " said Mrs . 671.5342515215134
But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . 1106.9812538371382
Mr . and Mrs . 55.85036198951862
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly <UNK> at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 1340.7424098146482
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . 1488.4941409585094
Bennet , was not so well pleased with it . 498.9089932358813
He placed himself by her . 372.1981890438747
where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without <UNK> a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . 1994.434305744241
is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must <UNK> us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . " Then shewing her purchases " <UNK> here , I have bought this bonnet . 2275.09428682251
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? 1778.0707108110241
Their powers of conversation were considerable . 1057.8569605532248
" I am , dear Sir , c . 373.6799237373105
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your <UNK> . " " I should imagine not . " " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . 1621.3675985449788
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ' s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . 1559.313832860199
" If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . 1077.206472463537
Are not you curious to hear how it was <UNK> ? " " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . " " La ! 1325.4693264475081
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance <UNK> , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . 2067.640964701329
do any thing rather than marry without affection . 1213.2500930917495
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 1319.9871164564966
He bore it however with admirable calmness . 852.2228669374437
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . 1665.923428002252
The next was in these words . 643.2507164783909
I cannot do justice to his kindness . 589.5943517232126
CHAPTER XII . 237.11669479662504
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she <UNK> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . 1942.747788961973
About the <UNK> , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . " Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings . 2368.506233183013
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half expectation which Mrs . 1282.6046732336943
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 1405.8513330582693
Its business office is located at North <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , . 2849.4859317887804
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1173.5800045513706
" Well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? 863.4011421630436
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 1305.4449361283494
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . 2085.4697816037024
Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously . " Mrs . 1632.7328301754112
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such <UNK> , and her intreaty that she would not give into it . 1668.5847803476934
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 1254.3316362893308
" I hope , " added Mrs . 209.23374781688167
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 1680.1947199231008
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . 1613.720350670712
It is useless to talk of it . " It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . 1415.634228610565
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 1203.0967031385408
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature . 1801.8842852054856
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " Ah ! 1760.3785332201858
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions . 1809.597655103875
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 667.0996483020798
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley is not he ? 1057.1378528399557
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome . 2255.7165942054494
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 1543.501286615709
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 1942.089535348964
I am going away myself . " " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . " And upon Elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr . Collins . " Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . 1943.5320854671052
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very <UNK> to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . 1107.7183130887563
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . 1653.20494640876
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its <UNK> . 2056.828865793541
I have not been accustomed to such language as this . 618.3563172824487
Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at <UNK> , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs . 1452.8537879374796
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> . 1148.7398953147772
How strange must it appear to him ! 1103.462858709983
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Philips ' s manners and politeness . 725.5976035854993
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . 1306.8912811467142
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 1540.6464151148953
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . 1572.2010052457426
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . 514.0150071880466
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . " " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . 1664.7134524213498
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 1496.4832486203388
intending to trace their route . 1270.6950011480624
I rather wonder now at your knowing any . " " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " I never saw such a woman . 1189.9269007218393
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 1519.7452384428334
It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . 890.746713659267
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . 1484.4335545224114
Elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several <UNK> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . 2278.653892533622
" It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . 789.2970505119836
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . " " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley . 1523.540614503242
I hope we may often meet again . " Elizabeth smiled . 795.3883261323115
To Caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit . 1349.1176262024796
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was <UNK> her feelings in <UNK> on Elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . 2207.813647241134
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . 1976.004940146711
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ' s . 1598.0313308621096
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . 958.2312263841695
and it was not wholly without foundation . 692.1580787422305
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 2129.431554613353
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 1852.623286704856
Poor Lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . 1635.5017914869027

The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . Oh ! 1187.3551175612429
How he lived I know not . 694.3453450983445
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . 1447.7061775901548
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a <UNK> , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . " " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . 1757.8170976579859
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 1256.7039519342518
He can be a <UNK> companion if he thinks it worth his while . 1772.2595043854312
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it . 2024.5894127434096
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . 1601.455674896264
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr . Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and <UNK> the prospects of Mr . Wickham . <UNK> and <UNK> to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a <UNK> , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the <UNK> of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the <UNK> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd . I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ' s accidental information , that Bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . 2423.8572874041593
<UNK> , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . 1281.9901528454623
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . 1109.8862564193546
Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . 1491.2147547515935
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . 1114.7184522394657
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . " " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . 1138.1957660201808
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . 2279.0840332521816
" I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel <UNK> ' s regiment went away . 624.7262690475449
<UNK> was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth " My dearest Lizzy , " I <UNK> myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . 2247.7094554643936
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . 709.0607323593936
Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs . 1001.7705528832695
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . 1521.061274116337
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 2168.0107837642577
Wickham ! 264.34922947049887
What shall we do with him ? 867.209949475789
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . 1495.1054898651862
I will speak to her about it myself directly . 837.9815654202029
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . 1867.58388539184
She saw herself the object of attention , to <UNK> and to <UNK> of them at present unknown . 1925.5179243575665
Why must their marriage be private ? 1105.3070666933638
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took <UNK> in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 1651.9882847630372
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 2137.40012320446
I hope they will not meet at all . 540.7527350443369
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . 1640.2147003505468
" Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . 1789.5866880338915
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . 1126.850940784711
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . 932.9203287151479
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> . 1159.5186624960932
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . " Mrs . 1610.495935306869
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . 1388.307519910682
Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and <UNK> passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . 1924.3970156078265

F . . <UNK> You agree to <UNK> and hold the Foundation , the trademark owner , any <UNK> or <UNK> of the Foundation , anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement , and any volunteers associated with the <UNK> , <UNK> and distribution of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works , <UNK> from all liability , costs and expenses , including legal fees , that arise directly or <UNK> from any of the following which you do or cause to occur a distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg tm work , <UNK> alteration , <UNK> , or additions or <UNK> to any Project Gutenberg tm work , and c any <UNK> you cause . 2744.192137394691
I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . " Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . 1694.2718149641557
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . 1448.2413396287463
Bennet and Mrs . 88.30924484680352
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <UNK> as these , what would have been her sensations ? 2226.881072649011
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 978.3696886760338
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . 1018.4316150737945
What is to become of us ! 828.6443157875859
Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s <UNK> , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any <UNK> of sentiment . If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error . 2448.562557908471
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . " " If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . 1813.2151469819282
Did he know of their intending to go off ? 1557.777696149351
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 1235.042763723411
Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it . 767.0684544238698
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time . 1975.5227436769583
Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . " After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! 1984.2670733811083
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of <UNK> , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than <UNK> anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 2496.9137963243525

It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 926.7343768212372
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of <UNK> the mind of his wife . 2640.384370437375
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle . 932.626322910974
But my dear Lydia , I don ' t at all like your going such a way off . 1438.75699698062
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ' s regiment . " His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative . 2201.4047150556926
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 1888.0728623847629
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 2194.3578468932674

I congratulate her . 202.25196423048698
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . 1386.2334993812165
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the <UNK> , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 1968.1402155069713
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . 1543.8711482172957
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . 1871.2855889863083
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . " " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger . 1949.6612020026464
never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F . 1722.631360170731
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! 1849.2366129686366
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . 1569.1997294789871
The <UNK> and yet the noise ; the <UNK> and yet the self importance of all these people ! What would I give to hear your <UNK> on them ! " " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . 2212.0040249313133
I will not tell you what it is . 514.1728524896959
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . " " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister . 1611.5855137276506
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its <UNK> , to think of any thing else . 1967.2970666301408
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . " " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . " " Pride , " observed Mary , who <UNK> herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe . 1471.775889738105
Mr . Collins ' s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . 570.1171513798279
Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 1810.476436093666
" How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! 943.558471875458
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 1663.8180168000945
The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . 2261.346473749706
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . 1611.943531402621
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . 1722.554048694176
Shall you like to have such a brother ? " " Very , very much . 1291.1343451315688
Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Mr . Collins began . 761.770223533482
But Mrs . 81.5515696290981
<UNK> that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . 1557.0248073365235
CHAPTER X . 237.11669479662504
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 1108.2376383413628
how I wanted you ! " " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . " " Certainly . 1501.3044544643672
You have done all this ! 548.00851263867
" Oh , Lizzy ! 206.05155999388035
I want to talk very seriously . 676.6237901888119
Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ? 1968.0918889383815
Bennet , " I am quite delighted with him . 241.51117734112196
He is a pleasant fellow , and would <UNK> you <UNK> . " " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 1466.15283051919
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must <UNK> him from such <UNK> misconduct as I have suffered by . 2272.6320871294247
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . 915.2462020494602
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister ' s being in town . 852.4142765391668
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . 661.8395839161408
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . " CHAPTER VII . 1408.793896231698
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey . 1021.277784486528
Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the <UNK> of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . 2133.600578709872
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . 1081.3530265036745
<UNK> such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 1507.3594396101616
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , <UNK> love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means <UNK> , though it could not be exactly defined . 2358.8455429777573
" But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing . 824.6979895036989
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . " " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an <UNK> , <UNK> disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will <UNK> the whole room , and be handed down to <UNK> with all the <UNK> of a <UNK> . " " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he . 2104.8244171257147
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 1838.08139221296
His brother in law , Mr . Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr . Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble <UNK> ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . 1987.9462341061585
One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! 1085.0645110021974
The express was sent off directly . 694.2581704672778
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Not a soul knew of it , but <UNK> . 1323.799110510364
A person may be proud without being vain . 1156.0744215366376
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! 1283.4454927431389
From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 2409.0815618965794
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . 1421.1449947008614
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 2373.905869484491
" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! " said she . 739.0759564393818
Hill and the two <UNK> . 1296.2597272157375
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and <UNK> study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . " And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his <UNK> she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . 2622.8932072391954
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us . 1180.5783588298634
What do you keep winking at me for ? 1063.2507215884245
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard <UNK> in any of the family . 1910.4308763033332
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . 2004.879178436694
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . 1650.3877925948311
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . 1965.0496519272167
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . 1727.0610138708466
I have by no means done . 372.322165730379
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> . 1635.8473512558567
Bennet and the children . 434.1265497589401
" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire . 1370.5173241325044
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . 1594.0094090308837
I saw them the night before last . " Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . 2000.5929544303344
I know your disposition , Lizzy . 488.97257934047553
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . 1687.7284296045127
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <UNK> <UNK> on the probability of each statement but with little success . 2095.978801153217
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 2297.4393421038026
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 1432.6145747560088
" You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 933.8656578433171
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 384.86091398952465
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <UNK> every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were <UNK> abroad . 2950.082506040572
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . 745.1465375873597
" Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 1677.6521779139239
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . 1826.2358466582132
<UNK> wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . 1574.6423391520334
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to <UNK> , and was but slightly affected by his <UNK> of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the <UNK> altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh . 2162.267033759103
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . 1354.4693829568369
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 997.5392674710313
Her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 1391.1803946606424
By nature <UNK> , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James ' s had made him <UNK> . 2044.3032461831087
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . 1681.1750356426999
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral <UNK> from the evil before them . 1635.8572481028007
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . 1635.5158089124202
After a slight <UNK> for good news , the letter was read aloud . 1732.7001649201518
Her cousin <UNK> his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the <UNK> of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . " It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . 1932.7644707686948
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 1819.6193942759533
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . 977.3164991522988
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 2261.09584276107
My mother was in <UNK> , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! 1471.9642372518908
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . 2355.9084751794567
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . 1264.4483026271341
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . 1338.8581946580157
But I will no longer <UNK> my young cousin . " Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his <UNK> at backgammon . 1526.6907025936414
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . 2001.7298146062583
His character was decided . 447.6958440423325
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " Darcy mentioned his letter . 853.1982351135409
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 1879.8989482117665
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . 1209.9879351093712
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . 1289.1159338142722
In a few minutes , Mrs . 224.14637782473332
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the <UNK> girls in the country . 1689.696577863437
are quite well . " " But you How are you ? " cried Elizabeth . 662.7305164213019
It was unpardonable . 217.96495588252944
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her <UNK> of Mrs . 977.0586954819033
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself . 1193.1506495460555
But vanity , not love , has been my folly . <UNK> with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . 2299.496515080038
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
It seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary <UNK> , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . 2146.170148805015
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . 1848.6083513659792
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been <UNK> from the world , in some distant farm house . 1842.4321931475283
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 1250.7611771269399
It must be an amusing study . " " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing . 1021.1978320007963
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . 1831.0727783560503
From that moment I observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 1794.2997539651158
Good gracious ! 386.37166695171186
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it <UNK> . 1542.8696310840464
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . 1386.0934416305065
<UNK> will be absolutely <UNK> , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . 2021.8067853730345
I thought I should have died . 475.1987483857523
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason . 1559.2841498652258
She performed her part indeed without much <UNK> , but Mrs . 1023.0421893202075
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook , complying with the rules is very easy . 1507.2805556407277
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . " " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . 1721.5763632701344
Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical . 1303.1815676036672
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! 1057.90006894842
Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a <UNK> air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . 2412.29921329687
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it <UNK> , has surprised me a good deal . 1894.7401562514858
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 1361.353983211428
She dared not even mention that gentleman . 849.479081256521
CHAPTER XV . 237.11669479662504
I will put on my things in a moment . 691.6450036614362
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 2253.8693854513685
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might <UNK> to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . 2165.3060207189933

They were natural and just . 564.4347544494124
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 1439.843204021532
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 2600.866482542877
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! <UNK> our surprise . 2528.014782686292

I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . 1020.7136029858582
Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . " " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK> accordingly .

Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 1438.1397216485836
Every <UNK> <UNK> in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther <UNK> of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr .

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 1902.2271750654545

When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . 535.3851121807701

Mr . Collins received and returned these <UNK> with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <UNK> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 2221.2488625500328
It was then <UNK> in the following manner . 818.361704063218

The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage . 2209.9256322620317
" Let us sit down . 521.3332446734897
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . 541.9652816231433

On this subject , what can you have to say ? 1040.935878153209
You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not . 622.9000077545805
Elizabeth did all she could , to <UNK> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 2290.5619169586607
" Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair . 464.23698344527145

" You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . 428.049882692654
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 1532.2766676500203
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . 1704.4390060481144

Well , well , I only hope it will last . 900.4595998771334
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears <UNK> the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the <UNK> . 2165.344543438291
They have some of the finest woods in the country . " Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <UNK> . 1480.7400693452316
We do not suffer by accident . 929.5469214170777
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the <UNK> property of some one or other of their daughters . 2527.0754120608685
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
" Your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . 961.9405863018195
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . 956.2609942033861
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . 792.4391943363406
You know him too well to doubt the rest . 914.2225284977286
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . 1020.673358044382
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .

Lady Catherine de Bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . 1442.3348115307103
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . 500.3146483689199
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 1201.2069523729485
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . 1641.5289661019387
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . 1510.6700317817706
With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were <UNK> understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr .

About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . 2125.2392528484074

From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . 1117.7858306891346
Your idea of the ponies is delightful . 1060.2450778106183
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 1448.1294087548695
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . 1100.760983552926
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . 2108.1619606316726
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set <UNK> . 1134.205613454435

She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . 1737.9470665265608
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over <UNK> , as I always am . 1531.9033892930618
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever . 1891.8427418859856
Bennet , " to walk to <UNK> Mount this morning . 739.1499806263075
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily <UNK> seeing him , till after the departure of the former . 2026.2839187815325
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " " Ten thousand pounds ! 1013.8797807375004
Gardiner . 126.27619172372152
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . 953.1228920658275
Let me mend it for you . 584.3920415307811
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 1712.096389330992
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . 1748.7565365586188
<UNK> of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where . 2350.4698428342695
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 774.0827041840951
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their <UNK> , <UNK> , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty ' s and Lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it . 1940.9111217167042
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . 2042.0316213924361
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative . 1285.6749554447424
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 1079.027775781069
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 1798.1386602022194
He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . 1555.7731425677425
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . " He is now gone into the army , " she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . " Mrs . 1454.3595821306926
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it . 2200.4860088938967
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " " Oh ! 808.5303432025177
Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . 1588.4280453243598
Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs . 2256.1130787624975
so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! 884.7457721878905
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . " And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr . Collins thus addressed her , " When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from <UNK> you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . " " <UNK> , Mr . Collins , " cried Elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly . 2097.9894940844106
But I must write no more . 425.3762955726388
She had very little notice from any but him . 670.6635990910529
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great <UNK> . 1061.8270254226443
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . 1612.7880961238925
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . 852.3049412676257
" My dear , dear aunt , " she <UNK> cried , " what delight ! 824.5753075155724
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 971.818537037093
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , <UNK> every chance of <UNK> himself by marrying well ? 2467.0760568377427
Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 1345.3575402472757
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . 1633.2416582794306
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . 1313.1352868617212
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 1667.5731684095313
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . 1149.1171149091065
What a fine thing for our girls ! " " How so ? 1093.7408622136736
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the <UNK> of his confidence in his friend . 1992.3494144958656
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 1337.4984161649602
Oh , Lizzy ! 325.74176342063225
<UNK> , wretched , mistake ! " Darcy made no answer . 1387.2627536545995
I came to try you . 421.6194590251386
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . 1978.8078185461616
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 715.2088592731097
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . 1884.8246518720837
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 1620.2529169058887
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . 1414.6395444011414
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . 609.7101425033558
" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <UNK> , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss <UNK> ' s . " " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . " " Oh ! 1834.2839610466647
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have <UNK> domestic felicity in so <UNK> a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . 2107.071679324549
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " My eldest sister has been in town these three months . 1434.100099854391
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . " " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 1208.5609226313027
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 1410.3466301467736
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 1755.1939098074317
Jane was by no means better . 441.089756632467
" Gracechurch street , <UNK> . 727.5399752810703
You are a gentleman ' s daughter . 519.4985307217513
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . 1149.7972541663796
Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 1022.9109464922549
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . 2631.4361346313235
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 2199.047410039134
" Yours , c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a <UNK> fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . " " Oh ! 956.0986743206325
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went <UNK> against the <UNK> ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <UNK> <UNK> , and give the praise where it was due . 2575.029683399218
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 2006.5271134558297
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 992.5782964307707
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . 1217.5287009901758
" <UNK> it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . " " Gracechurch street , Monday , <UNK> . 1383.5070719123032
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be <UNK> so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . 1820.9559857869565
It was all pride and <UNK> . 672.9095541869785
" Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever <UNK> , that your resentment once created was <UNK> . 1607.506418449573
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 1306.1170534687462
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our <UNK> ! 1660.9814953309467
" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . 1721.0366883219697
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! 1620.0278073906072
The old lady is Mrs . 371.7654548919104
I know it to be impossible . " " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! 644.4916938595778
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 1316.202093185936
CHAPTER XII . 237.11669479662504
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 2199.3849938641615
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . 1060.2497489823675
<UNK> me whilst you can . " " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . " " Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . " " I cannot believe it . 1008.1514908483476
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . 1205.8128750512703
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 2294.6348507869784
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 1808.4527722505773
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as <UNK> , were in very good time . 1759.8456923273561
She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . Mr . Darcy said very little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all . 1252.9072784679363
Yours ever , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " With the officers ! " cried Lydia . 1452.9458435563938
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . 1703.719395564765
But I will not repine . 331.5869080108501

Lydia <UNK> as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very <UNK> solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips <UNK> of turning away <UNK> , and if he does , Colonel Forster will <UNK> him . 2577.4910229823645
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 1843.3181676080153
But Mrs . 81.5515696290981
Never mind Miss Lizzy ' s hair . " " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . " " Oh ! 1241.8936768593496
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger <UNK> than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance <UNK> and <UNK> . 2180.5641795852525
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . 1541.5280956633405
came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the <UNK> , and at the <UNK> in Barnet and <UNK> , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . 2756.699753591901
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply <UNK> on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . 2142.019928138447
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private <UNK> in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of <UNK> with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . 2091.514247446967
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 1987.112439116825
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling <UNK> on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give . 2259.9867128934156
I had hoped that our sentiments <UNK> in every particular , but I must so far <UNK> from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . " " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . 1818.7843729246424
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . 2032.6437766117847
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 1371.7227195001583
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 612.1635801955154
" And may I ask ? " said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . " " <UNK> with ! 921.2307141042519
Such were the gentle <UNK> of Mrs . 693.9801332621038
Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . " " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . " " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " I honour your circumspection . 1346.1001503364705
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child . 1696.5114150051459
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . 952.4903497330156
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 924.5307204339467
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , soon collected them round the table . 2389.3829416941826
I have not that pain . 308.4954724784602
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . " " In what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought Elizabeth . 1618.6340531463275
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . " Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . 1823.5486912607305
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 1839.6792610944035
" There is nothing the matter with me . 465.27480162154774
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . 1136.541010115669
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ' s two sisters . 1992.818870787572
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . 1430.5633681901268
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 1625.6320760074595
<UNK> back the servant , therefore , she <UNK> him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost <UNK> , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly . 2734.758465702139
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due . " " My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . 1930.5358599796657
Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 950.5221786046981
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 1845.6467287662015
" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance . 1500.4447378669834
<UNK> inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in <UNK> ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the <UNK> Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . 2785.516503255235
I always said it must be so , at last . 708.0322524304516
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . 1450.6842246793676
Bennet very dull for several days . 841.6198228479501
Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> . 1817.614987387559
Had his character been known , this could not have happened . 1159.991210306399
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr . Darcy . 1617.5101266467123
Mr . Bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is <UNK> with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . " She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . 1953.7264151799793
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . 978.5480172101752
She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . 1963.917795106126
" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir . 596.2646881343735
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an <UNK> of Mr . Darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . 1365.0974027768407
The officers will find women better worth their notice . 1036.7445859526854
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more <UNK> purpose . 1942.1279929003574
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! 1040.8286521363887
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 2112.781722723333
<UNK> of business too ! 1338.6264422077386
Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time . 1376.7387270756406
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 2248.33460806716
I know not what to think . 327.08294048790714
Miss Bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs . 806.3480920311179
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . 1842.0659827973266
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . 1713.0609536073305
Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better . 344.50627113018516
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 786.792882645981
This is your <UNK> resolve ! 982.6911084996472
" This will not do , " said Elizabeth . 332.8046678141209
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of <UNK> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . 2090.657922115885
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <UNK> . 1854.0759809618473
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . 1022.7834111669221
Not all that Mrs . 318.0729822619271
She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 2075.2010714814255
<UNK> me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . " Elizabeth could not refuse , though she <UNK> little pleasure in the visit . 1548.3566446380748
Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately . 1809.544169024471
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 794.6194440305798
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 1144.0319431778864
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . " " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal <UNK> of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first <UNK> for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . 1634.570240505907
I hope you have destroyed the letter . 523.9451399654458
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth ! 2581.6147231832956
He comes down on Thursday at the <UNK> , very likely on Wednesday . 1772.457116664837
He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these <UNK> had arisen his principal <UNK> . 1866.939137653058
Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley . 616.8685590221093
Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . 1627.6399610078772
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 1410.8362448585683
" I am trying to make it out . " " And what is your success ? " She shook her head . 720.3369301296331
We must have Mrs . 287.37797845254687
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . " " Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . " " And do you like her ? " " Very much . " " I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . 1015.3217122096469
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . 1175.1250246496222
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . 2047.685537315841
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <UNK> her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 1588.061377414859
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . 1654.45340201796
You supposed more than really existed . 907.9753949100652
Mr . Collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . 664.7948953527739
The day of his and Lydia ' s departure soon came , and Mrs . 671.0055107740266
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford <UNK> , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 2007.616056105535
All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . 2073.1579225260184
My temper I dare not vouch for . It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world . 1648.2505531441013
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the <UNK> of my father ' s will , has been <UNK> acquainted with every particular of these transactions . 2379.0980608573122
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and <UNK> to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head . 1740.7397809239378
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to <UNK> , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to <UNK> his prosperous love . 2320.9352925937114
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 1288.5444042505476
Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active <UNK> , and when immediately before my father ' s death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . " " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth . 1396.9358278841703
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my <UNK> and care . 2001.921811657539
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . 1458.0077054605888
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned . 2014.8137943862355
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 1786.5668348964987
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . 1608.7544378316397
You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " " You mistake me , my dear . 773.6477697731738
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest <UNK> ; his <UNK> contracted , his air gloomy . 1915.8907194160518
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . 1754.4844102217367
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . " " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 1223.2204706905495
It was a large , well <UNK> room , handsomely fitted up . 1049.3799889081172
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ' s <UNK> , and complimented her on bearing it so well . 1816.9392098137164
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . 1922.29163291308
It was very little less . 390.2235556364978
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 519.8206563830576
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . 1308.5406280221598
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general . 1680.2838266173646
If you ' <UNK> believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 1557.113203582132
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . " Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . 1331.5239883556073
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s . 1850.3179853252534
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . 1154.5438186143263
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 1918.033237636729
Mary was obliged to <UNK> more with the world , but she could still <UNK> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <UNK> between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <UNK> to the change without much <UNK> . 2459.9968254104256
To know that her daughter would be married was enough . 1114.5195565318863
But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . " " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " Yes . 1633.2427628559803
Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . " Mr . Bennet made no answer . 787.7295749145687
What <UNK> money , what <UNK> , what carriages you will have ! 2061.8746116865204
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design . 2327.6524030634655
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . 1584.5092713263582
It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . 1521.6657282070655
Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . 1647.3352480738688
" Well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " What say you to the day ? 830.4482709132587
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . 1229.964604861075
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage . 1312.750134778611
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open <UNK> rejected . 1290.7008184838
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of <UNK> on Mr . Collins ' s side , and as many bows on Sir William ' s , they departed . 1623.608351294212
I told Mrs . 130.55957907253938
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " Elizabeth could not but look surprised . 1795.518688795474
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <UNK> <UNK> better than <UNK> ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 1925.678392515631
His temptation is not <UNK> to the risk . " " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment . 1379.3073803045456
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . 952.9294558137968
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 1402.184459992773
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged . 2088.824684959142
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 1793.1248316195963
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 839.5216599441334
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . 2123.925778096057
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first <UNK> his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . 2027.6318704034504
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in <UNK> , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . 2317.06895292256
Bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . 1534.284615630411
She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . 1019.1777699205134
He was the <UNK> , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . 1213.2533976904106
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 1569.6861255965166
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . 2380.288401501155
Well , but now for my news it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? 1865.6333660556413
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish . 2253.0458579182346
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . 1698.5719417803396
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . " CHAPTER IV . 1642.7306501061437
" But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . " " <UNK> , headstrong girl ! 1460.5540612190532
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <UNK> , but Mrs . 1377.1906051229273
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ? 1628.4543512891623
' Tis as good as a Lord ! 1251.8375776111611
It cannot last long . 416.14210061434727
She was busily <UNK> through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . 1972.5613881841007
Well , much good may it do them ! 1091.438018484321
You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <UNK> is denied me , because you have always so much . " Mr . Bingley arrived . 1470.3203932652848
Oh ! 64.29561561493922
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " " <UNK> do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 2215.1422748534724
Mrs . 20.546108000538364

" You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who <UNK> you in writing or by <UNK> <UNK> within days of receipt that s he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg tm License . 2120.9323619416523
No sentiment of shame gave a <UNK> to her triumph . 1668.2520339538755
I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . 1021.9426050000792
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . 1075.5844645209777
It was in the <UNK> and the <UNK> , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . 1421.473695112892
We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . 2598.2309229523626
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 1347.78324430559
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 1742.643357652785
I am prodigiously proud of him . 280.6440069710859
Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment . 450.2248934797176
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling . " " Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose . 1134.1570522593065
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 713.9734219634512
But I have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous <UNK> , boy in the world . " Elizabeth almost stared at her . " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she . 1688.0348440664436
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . 737.8149487686038
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 1002.2077716570785
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 1435.9367172837979
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . 1683.9845382993576
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . 1426.6605245653063
How is half such a sum to be repaid ? " Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . 1350.839651440678
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . 1669.1452123497672
CHAPTER XVII . 237.11669479662504
Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <UNK> at whist , enumerating all the <UNK> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he <UNK> his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . 2528.8323945581215
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . <UNK> immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . " " What is his name ? " " Bingley . " " Is he married or single ? " " Oh ! 1706.5233027406925
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . 835.3712114766147
Where does discretion end , and <UNK> begin ? 1870.6346301110673
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a <UNK> , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! 1355.6559240581544
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 1769.8697544939046
My feelings will not be repressed . 703.5880515563675
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . 1114.567694225886
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . 1467.1770766496143
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . " " To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . " " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . " " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . 1711.8844296776172
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . 1459.5077639909164
" You are <UNK> , Lizzy . 457.1870901217727
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <UNK> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . 2095.2448725580502
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . 2296.185471670844
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . 1591.8066763305983
" Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . 1050.8836523061495
Why any fear of detection ? 956.0764757904088
But we must <UNK> the tide of malice , and <UNK> into the wounded <UNK> of each other , the <UNK> of sisterly consolation . " Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " <UNK> as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is <UNK> that one false step <UNK> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <UNK> than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 2795.186264532197
Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and <UNK> its extent . 1571.3916260846124
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . 1405.7148786751145
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . 2283.197436860162
Whatever bears affinity to <UNK> is <UNK> . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 1963.3585145826112
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . 1222.4857035795048
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . " As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . 2286.1806379085438
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him . 898.6517063964252
How much you must have gone through ! " Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs . 1302.079186619125
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <UNK> . 1480.9828718611102
She could think only of her letter . 562.5863937035059
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . 1615.560215445072
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <UNK> . 1112.2846462279574
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
" Are you not diverted ? " " Oh ! 326.2304244198243
He cannot afford it . 308.40386796236913
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
But you are always giving her the preference . " " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . " " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? 1564.3296373231374
They all <UNK> tables , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> . 2355.5776601133352
She would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house . " Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer . 1123.3091256643722
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 764.4497550324885
Nothing could be more delightful ! 861.9739141658692
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs . 2416.9204604687907
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or <UNK> reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . 2676.5343203154766
Other schemes too came into her head . 1189.1602285219205
Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . " " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget . 1971.8373396014476
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments . 1448.7452431872166
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . 1223.3272475472072
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 1554.3134238676112
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . 1235.9260245632695
I depend on you for that . " To these high <UNK> expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the <UNK> of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . 1849.5515608787941
<UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . " " We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . " " But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs . 1393.0456258600475
His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 1078.0686148982156
His <UNK> to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 1574.6974173835354
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . 1397.382444844423
I wonder who first discovered the <UNK> of poetry in driving away love ! " " I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy . 1400.1091183174165
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . 878.3806811552212
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . 1791.5133448128688
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 1693.6950951382307
" You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age . " " I am not one and twenty . " When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . 1231.270298516009
I thought we never should have got into the coach . 1002.5942688335304
" Oh , yes ! if one could but go to Brighton ! 759.1239702847762
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . 1720.2207645338926
Bennet . 72.5898345451325
<UNK> , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . 2057.6453187614907
' Ah ! 499.1049943065024
His belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 1908.2604483444732
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . 802.917353428485
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . 1618.8090312537206
Their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse . 1548.4644153197228
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . 2263.729747431422
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . " Elizabeth could not <UNK> a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . 1984.1131027678446
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to <UNK> these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 1511.8820347878298
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? " " I think she will . 1229.768637819497
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 1761.7741199366742
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States . 1621.9360217686162
" For my own part , " she <UNK> , " I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . 1258.7135758356796
Gardiner , rendered <UNK> by Elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . 1314.3473585141917
To Mrs . 137.991142033306
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it . 958.0068082558392
Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to <UNK> it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . 1962.8418536067234
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . 1627.0125200154894
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <UNK> <UNK> . 1861.9470892548873
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 1305.4387191496423
Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . 2290.755411809744
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . 2302.3324608292255
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . 1786.723403308266
She was overpowered by shame and vexation . 559.6879335641237
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 2070.1551309273973
That tall , proud man . " " Good gracious ! 724.8297752736595
" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . " Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . 1929.4760470410567
CHAPTER VIII . 237.11669479662504
Very well . 297.7078848961409
Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 1244.7762596659952
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . 1237.1366465073959
" Oh ! 42.46667514260318
" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . " " You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! If my vanity had taken a <UNK> turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <UNK> . " On Miss Lucas ' s <UNK> , however , she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . " And gravely glancing at Mr . Darcy , " There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with ' <UNK> your breath to cool your <UNK> , ' and I shall keep mine to <UNK> my song . " Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . 2156.682788785826
Ten thousand a year ! 692.4450425585223
Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side . 1618.7305322791512
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 1237.277890767212
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please . 955.6040973676332
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 1543.6127459478437
And who knows what may happen ? 917.4810683839978
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 1005.0765674497927
' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! What , all five out at once ? 1569.7158426938931
" Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " for Mrs . 700.41740350687
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . 1164.6775037981652
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . 842.6999671078806
Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age . 1548.9086372171987
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . 1060.9393790243303
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . " " Not as you represent it . 902.201518772912
When I last saw her , she was not very promising . 871.4060495193268
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . 1176.5446788046918
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . 1510.7296236725172
What congratulations will then flow in ! 1023.7452993675164
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 1784.7428834425466
By tea time however the <UNK> had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . 1746.2079732903574
" Oh ! " said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . 745.0627367873942
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 1589.6223258146235
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . 955.9729725642198
I never was . 206.00178519795583
so much the man of fashion ! 1139.4866649631492
Poor Charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . 2130.219057357467
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . 1933.3269101678625
" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . 1600.6102946684018
One day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . 1757.0433884836655
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . " " I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a kingdom ! 1340.0063530862071
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . 1660.2939642751712
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . 1864.5953601123936
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . 1734.5523409505129
Her mother <UNK> <UNK> , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 2243.919568838795
CHAPTER XIX . 237.11669479662504
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 2191.6180992867235
<UNK> , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . 1481.4271683599532
" You look pale . 339.58189706688427
And then we were so merry all the way home ! 1185.2344846018684
It cannot be concealed from any one . 626.2501236337984
" Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 1633.4635654134277
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . 848.1831119270807
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . 2131.387258178529
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . 789.3353968148657
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . 1877.9269621392116
Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . 1212.856880247485
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . 2014.1335965287847
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . 858.697195734037
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? " " Oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all . 1493.7689743506278
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . 1532.4298988125197
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to <UNK> as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was . 1715.8569711078874
Mr . Collins ! " " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . 768.7553299395217
Miss Bennet had <UNK> ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . 1608.4430585008777
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . 1998.2030844929347
How could I be so silly as to wish it ! 1199.0495649683617
Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " Lord , how tired I am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn . 2242.6766769621227
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 1088.5608130935923
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some <UNK> neighbour , who could not be enough <UNK> , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 2364.663784612145
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 1453.6179471467985
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 2026.3817938950904
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and <UNK> forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . 1505.3742424682655
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <UNK> society . " " But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . " " Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . 1182.919711799164
Bennet . They had several children . 732.5228041740348
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . 1361.002117497322
And now here ' s Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 1632.1547582951155
" If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs . 744.732241598172
Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . 1594.4838388880619
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . 1231.4837412246166
But of course she did not mention my name to you . " " Yes , she did . " " And what did she say ? " " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well . 977.8804855491478
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 2081.7755593067336
After playing some <UNK> <UNK> , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to <UNK> such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " She smiled , but made no answer . 2017.4845539521864
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " cried Elizabeth . 1140.5975396189035
But I know the foundation is unjust . 730.3227413794641
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . 817.8103801539457
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . 752.1954925073802
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 1197.5251207729923
Section . 283.98127128057695
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> . 899.7344024144126
I thought I should have broke my heart . " " I am sure I shall break mine , " said Lydia . 578.3904683052688
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . " However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather <UNK> , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . 2301.3977132846044
" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? " Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . 1860.8265119949058
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 1564.8909987449163
That is all to be forgot . 901.9186804832027
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the <UNK> , and was soon out of sight . 1903.8186455611474
He still loves me , and we are engaged . " Jane looked at her <UNK> . 1347.5014603595264
and so did Mrs . 357.82876772864387
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <UNK> recommendation , and to assert that I had <UNK> all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . 2249.573929470147
They were to be off as soon as possible . 494.48506540750793
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing . 2141.605554093613
<UNK> in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . 1937.902345942723
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . 1313.2003832289831
" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . " He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very <UNK> thing , and called out to her , " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr . Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain . 1973.4708706941062
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 1799.5408281205027
I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 1550.418332438219
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . 467.450727922078
There was also a <UNK> of one thousand pounds . 974.5765213976945
Do not distress me by the idea . 948.7391853880657
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . " " For heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr . Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . " Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . 1772.1146493849221
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . 1554.1308439533968
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 2830.477115042456
Elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 1674.8259975606488
He replied , and was again silent . 645.7789508841935
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . 1082.7224853792509
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 2546.5422842356747
She will make him a very proper wife . " Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the <UNK> , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly <UNK> whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way . 2018.4196613965198
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 1928.8099287228194
Did you see it ? " Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . 1475.5587178562398
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . 1564.2980506537624
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged . 1511.8046357911492
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . 1580.8587822527477
Are the others coming out ? " " I do not know . 517.2708931101938
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
Her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . 1594.07887773804
There was no help for it however . 794.284015861748
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room . 1109.9207125924297
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 1536.4997356434226
" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . " Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . 1629.114818789636
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough . 908.8752688886516
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . " " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us . 1619.3285990412721
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . 1543.6026568543275
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 1203.0967031385408
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . 1631.798642499229
" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1189.893946156103
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . 1685.0157538456874
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs . 952.3922030848503
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 1244.5059786267288
If he fears me , why come hither ? 1014.6849821047838
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 2621.0280825347413
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . 1885.5550977303717
She practises very constantly . " " So much the better . 608.7740689732216
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . 1466.060321294535
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr . Darcy . " She then sought her eldest sister , who had <UNK> to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . 1490.6543725793035
Mr . Darcy ! 65.25616910754418
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . 1123.4251101383047
But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . 1208.5702797181225
Have a little compassion on my nerves . 1252.314628130485
Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . 531.3880990061863
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 1654.157183110885
The pain of separation , however , might be <UNK> on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . 1918.0262172391335
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <UNK> . 1960.1350343923016
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long . 2316.065454684596
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . 535.0893073964947
I am ashamed of you ! 370.29757017829354
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 974.5471296309412
I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . 1217.4656119494612
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . 642.6923820721316
Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs . 288.65730702733566
" I do not get on at all . 285.5692893655957
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so . 2255.1729562005326
" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . 1715.9737719633665
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time . 1199.3101153888363
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . 1138.7337743267121
After walking several miles in a <UNK> manner , and too <UNK> to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their <UNK> , that it was time to be at home . 2118.5459646365325
After a short silence , the lady first spoke . 1019.5215407220586
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . 1392.4591867021866
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . 1700.365816382876
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 1619.91242593031
She will not be able to help calling . " " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 1656.5038381384145
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . 2168.1334977326496
Bennet . 72.5898345451325
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! 1926.744050828044
Believe her to be deceived by all means . 1194.9754334023924
<UNK> Michael S . 1194.945005619581
I am glad he <UNK> here on Tuesday . 743.6558575760414
I am sure you must feel it so . " " Oh ! 279.6974671460828
<UNK> may sometimes be purchased too dearly . 1918.4990886478129
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . 1196.3904421273633
The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . 1849.951130673152
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . 2041.2939044814952
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and <UNK> them , after a short <UNK> , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . 1884.816951140445
Lydia ' s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , <UNK> engaged with one of the <UNK> <UNK> in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little <UNK> , of his house and garden at Hunsford . 1793.4610705088332
Mrs . 20.546108000538364
She blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who <UNK> their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . 1896.9105553395245
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . 1810.1312247390208
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . " <UNK> as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat <UNK> , she had all the success she expected . 2327.1992048325897
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . 654.847772313355
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will <UNK> excite . 2333.706047793569
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 1808.6849261631417
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? 1645.7940456370234
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her <UNK> intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . 1809.2425507818914
A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone . 1001.5419245176216
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united <UNK> . 2142.9705416839956
<UNK> he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 1883.8931593176403
Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent <UNK> and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . " Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " You cannot have a right to such very strong <UNK> attachment . 1936.1552892544905
This will never do . " " You need not distress yourself . 738.2530314912909
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 1498.0587156093445
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia ' s marriage . 1177.3757935579947
Such a countenance , such manners ! 1007.6291286403126
Mr . Bennet accepted the <UNK> , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . 1652.0574239499863
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last <UNK> , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were <UNK> answered . 1874.092121551783
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . 721.5030448180552
Such very superior dancing is not often seen . 1313.85858568965
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 1513.9321478943564
We have heard nothing from town . " " Dear madam , " cried Mrs . 632.6668825145717
Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . 2277.81922021385
<UNK> and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was <UNK> and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . 2709.992937912162
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " Well , Jane , who is it from ? 1251.094166030016
The <UNK> was <UNK> to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so <UNK> a <UNK> . 2657.2538777477384
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . " Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs . 1088.4987403211917
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 1714.9562064827257
Jane looked a little <UNK> than usual , but more <UNK> than Elizabeth had expected . 1862.482488936025
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . " " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be <UNK> with . 984.0818771741634
