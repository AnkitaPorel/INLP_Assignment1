15.214616645991025
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . 8.523329146441615
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 18.332117962226295
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 14.982572232168916
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . 11.993525280176819
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one <UNK> in it an object of compassion , while they are <UNK> of our intimacy at Rosings . " <UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> . 23.20426684734904
It <UNK> , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . 20.99557271918984
His revenge would have been complete indeed . 15.492024491869376
She is quite a little creature . 7.787215318858732
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . 13.66451744831969
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <UNK> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . 13.532756583926751
The <UNK> of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . 18.177969372410637
He was very fond of them . " This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham ' s being among them . 9.813871913058422
" Not yet , " replied Jane . 5.562688030272071
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . 7.3180848184243406
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 11.134081502067824
" Mrs . 2.2731338070496614
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 21.1585329972142
Are you going much farther ? " " No , I should have turned in a moment . " And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together . 13.784614133885466
She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs . 6.519177192180563
" His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . 7.1128776939332115
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . 19.063676723557148
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so . 23.790233078111285
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 14.263163069620031
Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment . 6.82661941723063
I was uncomfortable enough . 5.562119035303705
You refuse , then , to oblige me . 7.030866910906274
And she was only sixteen last June . 12.905764417196542
Why should they try to influence him ? 13.934299824573671
CHAPTER VII . 7.65426164366213
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . 15.080832915390364
In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 12.5679203228381
Bennet by admiring Mrs . 7.645673939245951
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . 13.562693104635116
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 9.664680330563268
<UNK> was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth " My dearest Lizzy , " I <UNK> myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . 24.777017819283436
my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 9.408806557454218
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? 13.543963349893744
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . 23.235902951082235
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . " " You are over <UNK> surely . 11.791170602700788
He has children of his own , and may have more . 6.383103453043041
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 15.9107384142116
It became her turn to listen . 9.68484543462854
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 10.60364870753966
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 18.033391178017144
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 14.87195661661433
<UNK> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all . 12.59283256225467
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world . 12.5582318076616
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 16.746004262707697
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 13.220657529999178
What will you think of my vanity ? 9.069573284330867
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 10.86785791519473
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . 17.234250551164855
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 18.345268583709615
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 8.704481031770868
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 18.15014047152896
Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . 4.0354443396512165
Forster and me are such friends ! and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? 15.161515981732455
Thank Heaven ! 13.256940674358882
her liveliness had been never worse <UNK> . 16.273169031605953
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 10.820535750495683
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . 25.382602441301266
Mr . and Mrs . 2.441706632085952
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . 9.157558630968532
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than <UNK> . 18.183190394860244
" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs . 10.541975430375903
With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were <UNK> understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged . 18.176650863601473
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may <UNK> to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund . 31.08096871597556
Such a disappointment ! 9.374243202321786
At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s <UNK> him entirely , for she was a most determined <UNK> ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making <UNK> and exclaiming after <UNK> , to have attention for any one in particular . 31.29151693269097
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 14.929845119405943
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 10.69495508266734
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . 20.668258664881705
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . 14.075472762567374
At five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . 27.63189501990172
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . 10.930946013289574
" Oh ! 3.9535946941154325
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 15.502986317100635
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . 31.437000550760228
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . 24.098953181140704
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot . 6.753877704008986
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 17.239091770690827
" You quite <UNK> Mr . Darcy . 7.667767854754598
I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . " " You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr . Darcy . " " No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ' s connections . 12.360457385554726
If gratitude and esteem are good <UNK> of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 26.35472956444744
My feelings will not be repressed . 9.232756251498172
<UNK> has she condescended to give me her opinion <UNK> too ! on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our <UNK> at quadrille , while Mrs . 25.711153769429067
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side . 16.814357254774908
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . 6.7698597672751095
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . 10.604674404405822
She comes to us to day . 6.2146735295579125
But I will not repine . 6.0706923355621925
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . 16.9738640086778
No , no , let me <UNK> for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret . 12.354497012039515
" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . 10.126350625725834
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . 9.899350904518405
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <UNK> ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had <UNK> , in his offer to herself . 17.29658098728663
He now wished it more than ever . 8.770586860584265
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <UNK> of Mrs . 10.775824689214037
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . 12.352554174169752
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . " " Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly . 14.489519351261855
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being <UNK> by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . 21.380809321868327
I have not that pain . 4.041358280446592
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . 10.086859737424598
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . 6.306650710700009
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 9.649644004455942
I will speak to her about it myself directly . 7.457250163946899
I can recal nothing worse . 11.607251540858568
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 13.620769532616073
It cannot last long . 7.211590001137012
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . 10.242476814105887
She longed to see Mrs . 6.737106195463772
<UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 14.769163259982815
My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . 13.744847016674882
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . 10.062532838698454
how I laughed ! 7.4273001415679465
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 8.955911496728008
In pompous <UNK> on his side , and civil <UNK> on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton . 22.649249047777065
Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at <UNK> , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs . 20.21534125442891
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 10.29808504625201
He was angry . 4.9119221995846525
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library . " Mrs . 23.00784974661374
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . 17.222265710876357
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . 15.31843314219732
Bennet could hardly contain herself . 9.818088558135548
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
<UNK> as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . 16.06405747850634
" Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 13.450634713200515
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 20.575694017119847
The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who <UNK> it , were familiar to them . 16.39103223232201
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 18.01646512649294
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . " " Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . " " And do you like her ? " " Very much . " " I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . 10.66375700445875
<UNK> and <UNK> support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg tm ' s <UNK> and <UNK> that the Project Gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come . 56.62135260831639
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . 15.700658667539518
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 9.714816280663628
We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . 17.129717727489815
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . 9.015446543994173
Gardiner , though unknown . 6.035705805562197
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 13.362981364805961
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 11.813811249598611
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 17.045962397667697
Wickham is safe . " " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . " " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane . 14.994176181435682
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 19.577383026428723
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . 12.52361931659299
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 10.482292083325063
The journey would moreover give her a <UNK> at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . 13.6862064958602
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 11.966622623513429
How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . 11.427026225032025
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 21.144149521932658
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 15.967203842201306
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . 8.062500674958597
I believe I have now told you every thing . 7.385432914093476
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> ! 10.474688022004761
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to <UNK> the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 14.178058670933122
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey . 8.611756650485894
My mind was more agreeably engaged . 12.845683626902279
Her <UNK> are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . 14.897473856883922

Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some <UNK> neighbour , who could not be enough <UNK> , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 22.556869729337375
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 10.980872592493439
I never saw such <UNK> , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " Mrs . 9.539580933877094
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . 9.077253119665484
" Yours , c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a <UNK> fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . " " Oh ! 11.589430670907193
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 20.326966473338807
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 13.32356970042079
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 14.192082497546215
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 15.017023673503198
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . " Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . 13.455904954988169
How are they even to be discovered ? 10.674564084022673
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? " " One of them does . " " Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . 20.585746134595137
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! 15.673677329660473
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 15.937962809583487
. E . . You may convert to and distribute this work in any <UNK> , <UNK> , marked up , <UNK> or <UNK> form , including any word <UNK> or <UNK> form . 36.38877351482609
But I knew I should persuade you at last . 8.32335012347116
I hope we may often meet again . " Elizabeth smiled . 10.040319479689558
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a <UNK> as this . 16.727966928839976
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling . 19.856727219891297
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 9.154764533541613
The vague and unsettled suspicions which <UNK> had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 21.001646660430584
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 8.730031461705208
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever <UNK> , and the <UNK> friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . 13.982969548512452
The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion . 17.794835837702283
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . 9.736521849901326
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 13.801870723735655
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 16.159586950434292
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last <UNK> , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were <UNK> answered . 14.850168548986742
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . 17.246094439734797
Bennet ' s civilities . 6.249783974077995
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s . 15.745432291204233
Collins so before you came . 5.903634024899473
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 16.742020511502368
Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <UNK> and <UNK> father ; and though he belonged to one of the <UNK> , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 22.279104781082548
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 11.957136630821402
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very <UNK> manner , with all the <UNK> which he supposed a regular part of the business . 18.05488649256249
Every thing that is charming ! 10.584567524694172
Elizabeth silently attended her . 8.034700273150486
Its <UNK> depended on others . 25.50091441799811
I speak <UNK> . 8.159663168960318
Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a <UNK> to buy clothes for his daughter . 17.226161284016897
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . 8.6645729782712
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 13.255341592192357
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before . 11.089985622644079
<UNK> more than half a day ' s journey . 14.389227237059343
We have not met since the th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . " Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when <UNK> to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn . 17.11638563786117
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 7.36044353109156
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 20.547811170165907
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 12.145837723152162
Four nieces of Mrs . 8.648181744438551
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . 12.184795211836862
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . 13.582309426155874
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 8.365061027609405
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . 12.58786476686444
You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her <UNK> , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . 14.82404269224086
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 18.211982353266553
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . 13.975044241120617
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 8.736967691456263
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 17.055471706922415
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 16.310226523664255
Such a countenance , such manners ! 9.693933544602146
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 15.078317351861347
And who knows what may happen ? 16.832515248161545
At night she opened her heart to Jane . 9.851337774172354
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to <UNK> the fruits of her own <UNK> offence . 22.21244479574078
He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 12.422475698387029
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <UNK> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 18.59834983211836
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 7.941011083685876
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . 14.478411059117601
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . 11.824048041845536
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 19.6276617031146
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . " " Ah ! 16.537366107829357
CHAPTER XIX . 7.654260973594331
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . 17.72412753878932
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 8.575621955046948
<UNK> are settled so <UNK> . " " You <UNK> perhaps to the entail of this estate . " " Ah ! 19.23189865880874
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might <UNK> to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . 17.58030387525017
" John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? " " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 12.84412874196635
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 12.968692354743418
Adieu to disappointment and <UNK> . 13.26901783649889
oh ! 7.872589422492765
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself . 18.254992694396606
I did not think Mrs . 4.348548719418636
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? 18.05763729821904
But no such recollection <UNK> her . 11.812663511050646
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 10.452075387208888
I do not wish to avoid the walk . 6.370950153302918
This cannot be ! 6.522955264393273
But you are always giving her the preference . " " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . " " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? 14.41438043155609
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 22.76511657610502
" I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could . 6.270503534655935
Her ease and good spirits increased . 13.03520711548857
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . " As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the <UNK> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . 14.890539292328747
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 16.947259521721406
" You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . 10.799653909924091
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 22.34454683245237
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . 8.851600818488711
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 12.169902678707837
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . 8.102766357005772
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . 11.984253805332608
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs . 16.860831903034367
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the <UNK> , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 20.455363384224718
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . <UNK> staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . 20.57930047390497
" I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . 23.008151135796314
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . 9.679751731086725
Yet he is such a man ! " " Yes , yes , they must marry . 8.682459176104029
It was only said , ' <UNK> , George Wickham , <UNK> . 12.049420890770584
Mary was obliged to <UNK> more with the world , but she could still <UNK> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <UNK> between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <UNK> to the change without much <UNK> . 21.594208845965746
CHAPTER X . 7.654260973594331
The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 15.13723499797844
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 7.925863908642895
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 22.33085732588103
I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 12.25244014892705
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . 15.294841780788555
Mr . Collins was carefully <UNK> them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <UNK> them . 16.821695294403714
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . " " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . 13.552974141612276
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 13.973639738075672
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry . 12.07527087419352
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage . 16.958370809532063
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . 8.473964958041412
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 19.08287740597884
CHAPTER XIV . 7.654260973594331
I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 10.395256429860188
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 17.18067922306386
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 13.204217920706219
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . 8.370584599278407
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . " He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 20.707629559211107
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <UNK> have alarmed her . 18.974003378215716
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . 10.389623741299074
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a <UNK> ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 17.58647214245737
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook , complying with the rules is very easy . 20.491655511543602
I shall see her in January . 6.859989194550565
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room . 13.382238697722892
Her cousin <UNK> his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the <UNK> of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . " It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . 14.192622013416306
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . " Kitty , who took all these <UNK> in a serious light , began to <UNK> . 20.304247273529807
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane " I hope and trust they will yet be happy . 14.35605272036071
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 11.445933648482182
" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 8.860431013008611
<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 12.072789682576133
" Oh ! 3.9535946941154325
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 13.118214476923779
Bennet , alarmed . 4.185208611923393
Bennet . They had several children . 7.571535711837851
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself . 20.959782100368308
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 11.612875232585901
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . 21.186023634389215
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 12.012246757895396
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ' s . 12.868768207864582
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . 17.95405617810285
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . 22.186959161321962
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 9.69089160083706
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . " " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . 12.45646965403082
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs . 21.647278907721763
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 12.321129834985276
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia ' s marriage . 11.045619591672283
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! 12.71588363855642
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 16.534868498074918
My poor father ! 9.658337742122246
He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these <UNK> had arisen his principal <UNK> . 18.99773571598611
By nature <UNK> , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James ' s had made him <UNK> . 27.44896033520154
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 16.276390118398393
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 15.752518549856388
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 10.35119429713666
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the <UNK> girls in the country . 16.854440604466728
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 7.652925622577678
He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , <UNK> friend . 12.929006485641546
" How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! " cried Lydia . 15.993778665713334
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <UNK> <UNK> necessary . 27.171557701767235
CHAPTER IV . 7.654262124377574
Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> . 20.199038637239997
" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . 10.243458592421353
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern <UNK> , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . 18.11542662066272
" How strange this is ! 8.426745805588514
If the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the <UNK> . 36.144637347442384
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 10.032955374927806
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 17.252708256091935
has she any family ? " " She has one only daughter , the <UNK> of Rosings , and of very extensive property . " " Ah ! " cried Mrs . 11.168467947661554
But really , Ma ' am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . 16.8464612950062
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left <UNK> , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . 15.977215724929769
What congratulations will then flow in ! 16.230289887072043
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 11.535388095962311
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . 17.64305044090984
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 6.61603784383584
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 18.471963731851034
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . 7.00690956926266
" So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find . 8.234503922912651
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much . 8.213780936414603
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <UNK> , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 22.660728193288286
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 16.02431554448982
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell . 14.687832253787612
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . 14.166910808932846
She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece . 19.381391432349265
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her . 16.325994588294055
I am ashamed of you ! 5.667521063547309
Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? 10.574275079659778
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her <UNK> . 19.860869096106114
CHAPTER XIX . 7.654260973594331
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . 8.34574832299328
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose <UNK> of <UNK> support . 47.11320569270919
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and <UNK> forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . 15.207172869343768
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 9.259318094870324
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . 12.791288235779161
CHAPTER I . 3.1334467313064245
How strange must it appear to him ! 10.83443015737108
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . 13.772297565767214
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? 10.008911506105083
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . 13.20882112062332
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . 9.639538405328238
It was to be such a secret ! " " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject . 7.766072156593009
Her ladyship ' s carriage is <UNK> ordered for us . 20.156093779895226
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 21.652083503366217
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 20.549746016261224
Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 13.96193733215506
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . 7.085510631150742
After <UNK> their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ? 51.07912571617235
Lydia ' s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , <UNK> engaged with one of the <UNK> <UNK> in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little <UNK> , of his house and garden at Hunsford . 15.213664507914318
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so <UNK> . 13.786434310671988
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 8.951981720193055
Elizabeth hoped she had <UNK> him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 12.939775979242262
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 10.706488826663604
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 10.442887645110495
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 17.67087083327483
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . 16.508752185127896
I cannot do justice to his kindness . 7.568865907059262
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 17.986293984062552
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 11.453039903246712
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 21.15826178728622
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <UNK> . 16.351795012554202
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth <UNK> out the coffee , in so close a <UNK> , that there was not a single <UNK> near her , which would admit of a chair . 19.456424924517908
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 12.482215759466744
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 15.928294621965192
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . 15.987177944901513
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . 10.314394992743802
Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed . 13.093011992502575
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 12.883449959650951
They then went away . 7.851303357410993
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a <UNK> as that , it might be of essential consequence . 12.920606751110366
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <UNK> , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . 17.126537662624887
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . 18.190408455250367
" I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends . 8.303708454474293
Nobody wants him to come . 10.280361198495756
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 17.354501028995813
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 14.717087397476686
yes ; there is nothing in that . 5.949105834515361
She represented to him all the <UNK> of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . 14.165624183485075
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 23.44987882304445
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 14.549380070134722
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " " Oh ! 12.052662090916641
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 12.880906313875792
Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . 9.92754618304138
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 17.242887088780364
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . 16.60095174752003
But does not Jane <UNK> with the sister ? 11.528202242154364
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 13.623827454433506
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . " " I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 20.493157034632404
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 7.2543014580142655
For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently . 16.45544991516293
<UNK> of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . " Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready <UNK> . 20.106957465271165
Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the <UNK> . 12.894620214014767
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you . 10.65504945071039
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ' s character . " Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " <UNK> there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 18.482904703057184
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . 16.77274772360856
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? " Nothing less than the complaisance of a <UNK> could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most <UNK> courtesy . 24.644857999101443
Illustration <UNK> <UNK> PRIDE PREJUDICE . 60.738502769421025
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . 10.272182803775737
I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! 14.01199832231694
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . 19.2881575513659
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . 22.657996152828474
She is gone down to her uncle at <UNK> ; gone to stay . 12.769711015661061
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 12.476606996951446
but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley ' s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the <UNK> have no horses to theirs . " " I had much rather go in the coach . " " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure . 11.383332694981593
I must beg to return to the house . " And she rose as she spoke . 8.340064333848689
One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! 8.819586927175004
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 11.288061544750265
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
You have delighted us long enough . 10.380081011595175
From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . 11.424260789046418
Bennet said only , " <UNK> , nonsense ! " " What can be the meaning of that <UNK> exclamation ? " cried he . 13.779154494158746
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 19.292553421201998
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 14.224938390557467
Though our kind uncle has done something towards <UNK> him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . 24.52183221082283
But think no more of the letter . 5.1806038246824935
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 11.485452916415314
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 17.046960968328637
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be <UNK> . 10.628168715389632
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 14.270143254073997
<UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> . 17.406606362919394
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 20.276466336506022
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 18.423076356523147
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . 9.275307041782291
I am not <UNK> you know . 7.355593721386585
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . 17.507015466850504
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . 10.566185155959248
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before . 20.18522826872494
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 21.938835456095784
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 14.065989071019894
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees . 15.74871386427706
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and Mrs . 16.613022545202305
The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . 16.23197233431557

How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 17.43685929210334
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 15.017891190314836
Can I speak <UNK> ? 17.39647083939046
Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . 6.041032731051812
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and <UNK> the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 20.961612493793865
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 14.058417966600908
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . 21.211743148202217
And poor Mr . Darcy ! 6.699430686661014
and to see dear Wickham too ! 6.7845859537614785
" You are <UNK> , Lizzy . 7.402712864082398
But the case is this . 4.9226899191804705
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . 9.125141679512737
Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . 9.32358369680182
He placed himself by her . 7.088341266702561

She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 10.414029594550051
But who was your mother ? 6.779968396767647
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 16.172138309988
Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . 16.77781371589969
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . " " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . " Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . 12.197435281627794
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 13.095578515054306
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 15.91616706971057
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . 15.067521101962505
" Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . 8.468167504694591
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 11.254367757232885
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <UNK> infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . 23.67771383486793
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 17.73976059218192
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . 12.29538128009173
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 12.29103981711753
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . 9.33186133238094
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . " " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth . 13.714039969693498
III . 4.703327276531973
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . 10.347178309879576
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . 7.271516314219725
sir , I do indeed . 5.46262329320401
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her <UNK> you . " Mrs . 8.14013515585918
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 27.005679865963135
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general . 12.840730336251292
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . 10.069877713979865
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . 19.643598559166303
It was a fortnight since Mrs . 7.100080750322097
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . 9.94735203324335
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means <UNK> or <UNK> , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . 22.921590305153135
You must not suspect me . 7.542676358039567
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 17.048217926425508
They are gone off together from Brighton . 13.809776528644095
And then when we came away it was such fun ! 14.398270694630192
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 17.976852360031007
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> . 28.460024474601532
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . 8.70350178624124
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 19.700902730394898
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 24.482842251110252
But I dare not hope it . 5.550645624542193
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 12.814769724843071
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . 10.759452027371434
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . 16.84345307891167
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 19.411423058887422
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <UNK> them . 8.7169152759466
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 12.62484798381227
I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 20.031950985072502
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
And is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? 9.676597466871447
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 18.064169428849095
I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to <UNK> such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room . 14.76665950532388
I had not believed it possible . " " I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth . 6.022268563980179
She had very little notice from any but him . 7.917165626901954
We have heard nothing from town . " " Dear madam , " cried Mrs . 10.641924513174546
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 17.096707266081225
Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . 9.667711023278907
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . 19.29566510473027
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 15.702032344429314
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . 22.56135949229258
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 12.527598672662366
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy ! 11.3369060406815
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 15.701699424271698
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . 13.043599330338303
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . 14.26286466414301
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 8.466570220526293
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him . 9.437985993012221
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs . 7.117141963952169
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <UNK> ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 21.156840249322237
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . 15.121131031831549
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 11.33456944278094
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 25.891726571107373
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 10.909596731450133
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 17.760331938159812
The hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . 16.407635091803602
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 11.914072870712863
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <UNK> recommendation , and to assert that I had <UNK> all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . 17.946030965339453
I shall go distracted . " This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . 17.501179085420564
From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an <UNK> chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . 18.626402171582548
Jane was by no means better . 6.6262804621247815
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 14.369781914957166
Bennet ' s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . 10.981730002506067
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 33.04357750227331
With many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs . 18.95314383085596
how unlucky ! 8.305338117759204
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of <UNK> them . 14.996114670945992
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . 11.875917535801406
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing room . 14.762813470087366
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 8.831803502165814
Will you come and see me ? " " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . " " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . 10.932075333103032
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 16.06222490029167
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . 15.516263737184254
Hurst ' s gown " Here she was interrupted again . 13.652631780228054
They were to be off as soon as possible . 7.124213992400407
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 9.96281585885105
Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon <UNK> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 26.18802497252132
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild <UNK> of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . 20.72440954646576
" Good gracious ! 9.633123540177058
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 19.558744932901817
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . 19.93810298506528
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 20.783898408195597
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . 30.923464785866525
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <UNK> <UNK> her there . 15.234794501387352
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . " " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be <UNK> beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen . 15.025251164656767
They will ruin your happiness . 10.323010717939065
In Three Volumes . 14.990310088043724
Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not <UNK> . 14.966388896775012
" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be <UNK> , for <UNK> I must call it . " " It is wonderful , " replied Wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 15.196401675217368
I am the happiest creature in the world . 7.370676958070156
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 9.781005789999163
" He only told me , what I have now told you . " Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart <UNK> with indignation . 10.752777453468015
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the <UNK> , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <UNK> . 16.918578726445617
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <UNK> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 31.95898968845097
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . " " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " " Has your governess left you ? " " We never had any governess . " " No governess ! 18.579973421481384
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was . 14.427464138425151
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 22.78024243935061
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 4.691756752455979
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . 11.101601887281712
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold enough to say before how much I like him . 14.60187249200316
What are men to <UNK> and mountains ? 19.188745040630806
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 16.74556524888752
" Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . 4.04718121891327
<UNK> since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 14.21946531475187
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 19.08626675788278
" My dear <UNK> , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of <UNK> each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s t te t te between two women can never end without a quarrel . 24.981258555549463
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 15.47219650021146
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . " " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . " " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . 11.81438586998287
Mr . Wickham ' s chief object was <UNK> my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of <UNK> himself on me , was a strong inducement . 20.278887868761938
" He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . 12.957237273620288
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 13.685130947936411
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . 8.790510732869343
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? " " Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . 15.023798569726594
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . 16.201466150070566
" Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 14.351835923839989
do not repeat what I then said . 7.695305454894424
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 13.851532956966922
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of <UNK> . " He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . 13.708361234728178
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 14.835943149567138
There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . 7.657064339576378
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <UNK> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <UNK> , and paid off every <UNK> of civility to Elizabeth . 22.091773772046682
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs . 5.951230872068295
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a <UNK> fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered <UNK> to the repeated <UNK> of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 18.98877371006205
" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . 10.920429039663722
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 18.117064135308524

However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 12.273173603190338
Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 13.012764963741633
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 29.04241793993566
After playing some <UNK> <UNK> , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to <UNK> such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " She smiled , but made no answer . 22.617991778770367

She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 12.800262021305878
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 12.70206200750119

With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to <UNK> his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be <UNK> <UNK> . 15.69391569255089
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 10.183957555245431
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 5.226430312054767
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 14.952300034262775
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 14.97739099145776
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 11.873659324934026
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . 11.03733974342881
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 13.094941773808957

Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 25.197855393977484

You shall hear what she says . " She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . Hurst had a house . 19.312848429749163

She turned from sister to sister , <UNK> their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . 14.531322994791195
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 8.167256367924177
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 11.417277738543975
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . 9.361376378948838

The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . 14.020132949020235
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him . 35.78550584835722

A thousand things may arise in six months ! " The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . 26.600059052175634
Nor was Darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 14.764833925238024
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 19.17975528181492
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking . 12.464880555137444
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 18.42988257925215
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 16.4544498256373
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 13.91852363936992
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . 22.01925073665307
You have done all this ! 7.226276046197362
" You forget that I have made no answer . 7.633745247630511
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 20.187348190908306
" Do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; " that is rather singular . " " Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " <UNK> cards . 13.244514177965987
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia ' s leaving home . 16.108600772126547
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! 20.501975916953338
I don ' t know . 9.081115045109739
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 6.9974018890399385
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 18.957963709451594
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 16.385488438467824
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 14.056146466573697
I only hope they may have half my good luck . 11.87100065217466
Mr . Collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . 10.614587941302126
Are not you curious to hear how it was <UNK> ? " " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . " " La ! 12.861875837589748
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 11.008692683983586
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 9.198809631672882
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . But good lord ! 12.298506777607825
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . 15.25828277099369
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 12.843892628281157
It was to this effect " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well . 18.46548817167595
F . 3.8355300083888526
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . 13.916819634647675
CHAPTER XVII . 7.654260973594331
She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <UNK> in so small a family as her ' s , and <UNK> her as to the care of her <UNK> and her poultry . 17.36909932490868
I thought it my duty to give the <UNK> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well <UNK> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . 21.24299128261123
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 10.761124956386542
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other . 10.684405725654996
I am going away myself . " " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . " And upon Elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr . Collins . " Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . 19.619581932414103
Long and the Gouldings soon . 7.832773859581765
Jane was not happy . 4.063080062814066
Very nonsensical to come at all ! 12.453632245675111
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . 12.158206966307539
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with . 11.503145579671532
It is useless to talk of it . " It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . 13.140096754854488
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman <UNK> the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . 12.922646806439056
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 6.871619842696561
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . 14.624460974575163
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat <UNK> attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must <UNK> every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <UNK> . 23.935703807212494
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . " While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much <UNK> to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s . 21.41774494023087
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 19.87291088159408
If the <UNK> of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . 18.42580440021249
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . 14.48763611380498
Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated . 23.082855434203623
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that . 14.02337964765349
" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . 11.66135360760993
I know it to be impossible . " " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! 9.465304023649098
The first part of Mrs . 5.747767666868488
He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? 11.13961698587455
The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 16.94439201562367
" And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! 8.066234228280296
I know your disposition , Lizzy . 5.631501354761671
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . 12.524377879960735
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 11.941338906762832
His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . 13.758891387726978
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . 30.39252005506231
Make haste , and come down this moment . " Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . 23.31195266435284
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . 16.889943363217036
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> . 26.068535664726845
Sir William did not say much . 8.467263542212747
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . 17.758088560619353
And it was settled that we should all be there by <UNK> o ' clock . 17.365129580222288

Kitty and Lydia take his <UNK> much more to heart than I do . 12.452527920081833
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 17.681449626121765
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . 8.754592038274
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . 10.985898325211801
They agreed that Mrs . 6.478924360410365
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative . 10.941158847580004
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the <UNK> , but of that I <UNK> . 13.655506950120166
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 18.47512285048306

Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? 19.84397013862064
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 20.74209112710334
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <UNK> what <UNK> felicity really was . 33.340286605718255
He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . 10.904768656676227
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation . 12.391388134075711
Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 11.445892605851663
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . " " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 10.461137738209882
Your <UNK> are by no means unlike . 20.100734088963023
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 16.287532739087755
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 22.778997226771363
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 13.073565786530368
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . 13.300642685609827
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . 12.254862780953482
Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . 8.39174807014457
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 18.743629503851487
<UNK> , selfish girl ! 16.31453235681748
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 21.971725839262923
Their table was <UNK> stupid . 20.69516711195941
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s foot <UNK> , that she said , ' Mr . Collins , you must marry . 15.20780287754342
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time . 12.978443687208589
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage . 13.214301634157188
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . 14.790147814384449
no . " " I can much more easily believe Mr . Bingley ' s being imposed on , than that Mr . Wickham should <UNK> such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , <UNK> , every thing mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr . Darcy contradict it . 15.986848006872764
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . 14.905583752938625
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . 4.895574722394152
Miss Bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . 10.982474898031027
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . " " And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the <UNK> of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! 13.11680902143818
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs . 7.151955427660776
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 16.58595255635366
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its <UNK> . 12.552037753642585
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . 11.195833688381489
I am very , very sorry . 4.555609860896293
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 17.60500665510831
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 14.701439864120394
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane . 14.22631664605416
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth . 11.717638597754796
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 15.268836175511366
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 10.009440863149996
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 5.289375148473826
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " CHAPTER XVIII . 11.562406008607216
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so . 11.078661015306261
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 13.890507473414745
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . 12.130461289426153
<UNK> me whilst you can . " " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . " " Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . " " I cannot believe it . 11.780289021665638
On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . 14.275700739478372
It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> . 12.541028393994614
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 12.127198895345177
Lydia was Lydia still ; <UNK> , <UNK> , wild , noisy , and <UNK> . 17.043587159242087
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . 15.136196305285917
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 10.968111165025466
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 18.376866569907854
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle . 10.522558848340589
She will be down in a moment I dare say . " He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 10.858981405423645
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 10.833373183106072
I never was . 2.7478950554352175
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . 10.8915790408666
and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! 14.526751357064612
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 22.59678292759116
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 19.141408454328296
F . 3.8355300083888526
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it . 10.742658068051885
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not . 12.608422476668407
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 10.222829335394483
" Let us sit down . 9.857905772593886
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 16.99075099238666
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . 17.756060856534184
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 10.726517430141445
The party did not supply much conversation . 11.716685717775466
But slyness seems the fashion . 13.34359612222674
It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed <UNK> ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among <UNK> woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its <UNK> parts . 23.6276304832636
Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a <UNK> over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was <UNK> Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <UNK> . 16.386862810389122
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 9.768175445782935
yes I understand you perfectly . " " I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . " " That is as it happens . 13.314950090122698
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 7.761122827212696
Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . " In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . 10.907050638766163
Hurst was observing their game . 11.841033238577964
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be <UNK> to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a <UNK> nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . 23.870725643385516
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 15.458916125481457
Thank Heaven ! 13.256940674358882
Bennet was <UNK> engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <UNK> them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather <UNK> than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . 19.717918786911724
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 7.273670549018851
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 7.179000209712617
She then took a large house in <UNK> street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . 29.141123762620683
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 18.405837916427807
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! 18.09998702186473
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 15.18866700235179
I will answer for it he never cared three <UNK> about her . 14.365647121143136
Collins . 2.590745266357415
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 10.31052570305578
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 20.775409298401804
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true <UNK> will derive benefit from such as are given . 22.641566179945162
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did . 12.059090387574585
Is not it so , Mrs . 4.378750340056194
Elizabeth took up some <UNK> , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . 18.92207971945139
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . " " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . 14.634669286157516
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 15.490541708367523
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 16.939550525320087
Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " This walk is not wide enough for our party . 14.29574344757323
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy . 18.089447743668664
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . 15.910134988190276

She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . 10.555325437306527
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 9.104230953659034
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> . 24.94565659903584
Yours ever , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " With the officers ! " cried Lydia . 14.1471359468081
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very <UNK> in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . 16.42168864108094
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . 16.835891217271822
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . 20.536598193283332
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 13.070008561181362
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 11.427642955827224

The first week of their return was soon gone . 10.186130014318827
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 12.541739294355773
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 14.89584234190744
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 16.364375722954616
It was not all settled before Monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . 10.34536745673753
Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and <UNK> passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . 16.351999243918595
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 10.514188107528502
There could not <UNK> in the world two men , over whom Mr . Darcy could have such <UNK> influence . 17.643061603222165
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> . 16.098105952072338
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , <UNK> , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . 29.730292712788057
Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him . 9.56767943381207
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 15.918304636740576
I know you will contrive it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . 13.003053726011727
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . 19.09536422652302
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 17.973777427132912
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 8.659470635528127
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his <UNK> powers had gained him in the <UNK> . 19.26590553422409
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley <UNK> with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . 19.209746997299856
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . 9.886913762394661
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> . 13.072011981176908
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , <UNK> , absurd . 20.680113379666693
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 14.163068858735329
CHAPTER IX . 7.654260973594331
Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently . 9.43047553099251
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 12.027758083991468
I am not qualified to form one . 7.945955600060246
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 14.034973551434422
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 13.546672621252831
Without a governess you must have been neglected . " " <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . 15.901488397032734
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of <UNK> and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 22.646457167288418
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an <UNK> on every subject . 14.659372712349448
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . 15.574230646471582

But she would not be secure . 5.636787248329148
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent .

But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a <UNK> of emotion they excited . 15.549509344571488

One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . 12.67068885051766
A regard for the <UNK> would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . 23.439100800735048
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 9.413518592404225

" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived .

The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 17.84115042094511

Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your <UNK> .

<UNK> , stay , I will go myself . 8.635921820407322
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now .

Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . 11.818310810504014

Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . 12.077606294033522
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 17.23795646729334
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent . 10.318129880968844

They were hopeless of remedy . 10.771105225135397
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed ! 21.343752359105725
My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr .
