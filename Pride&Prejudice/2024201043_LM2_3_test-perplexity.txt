17.492190090771683
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 4.216965034285822
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . 2.610157215682537
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 2.610157215682537
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . 3.8746751204561316
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . " " You may depend upon it , Madam , " said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , " that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . " Mrs . 1.5441135899948315
Who are your uncles and <UNK> ? 12.915496650148839
Philips first brought her the news . " Well , so much the better . 3.8746751204561316
I could hardly keep my countenance . 12.915496650148839
By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <UNK> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 1.8047217668271702
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 3.1622776601683795
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 6.812920690579612
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 2.9935772947204895
My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . 2.4244620170823286
Mr . Darcy was <UNK> him with <UNK> wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . 2.0092330025650473
The <UNK> and yet the noise ; the <UNK> and yet the self importance of all these people ! What would I give to hear your <UNK> on them ! " " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . 1.6876124757881477
This was agreed to , and Mrs . 10.000000000000002
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . 6.812920690579612
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . " " You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . 2.2758459260747883
I can recal nothing worse . 17.78279410038923
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . 2.610157215682537
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <UNK> for Mr . Darcy ' s pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham . 1.1164695682554597
Collins , you must send a servant with them . 6.812920690579612
I am glad he is gone . 12.915496650148839
Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ? 2.4244620170823286
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 5.878016072274914
Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . 3.8746751204561316
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 1.9684194472866121
You must contrive to send somebody . 12.915496650148839
Consider Mr . Collins ' s respectability , and Charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . 3.359818286283782
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " Darcy mentioned his letter . 2.7213387683753076
They saw him often , and to his other <UNK> was now added that of general <UNK> . 3.1622776601683795
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 10.000000000000002
Did he know of their intending to go off ? 6.812920690579612
Well ! 316.22776601683796
Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . 1.7534865500829584
She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . 1.8957356524063758
On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . 1.2915496650148839
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 5.179474679231212
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 3.1622776601683795
<UNK> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all . 1.6496480740980204
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified . 3.8746751204561316
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 1.4412195967188537
When you told Mrs . 26.82695795279726
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the <UNK> of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . 1.353876180022544
END OF VOL . 46.415888336127786
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam . 1.2328467394420661
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 1.4773776525985112
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short <UNK> . " " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . 1.4873521072935114
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not <UNK> , but haughty . 2.610157215682537
You <UNK> me for coming ? " " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you . 1.93069772888325
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 1.396135390856794
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 1.5441135899948315
" You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice . 1.7082763938087104
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . 4.641588833612778
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 2.2758459260747883
Good girl ! 100.00000000000004
" How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . You think it a faithful <UNK> undoubtedly . " " I must not decide on my own performance . " He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . 1.3768571648527583
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 1.6681005372000588
If , indeed , it should be so ! 8.11130830789687
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . 10.000000000000002
" I am sorry it went off . 10.000000000000002
Is not it so , Mrs . 12.915496650148839
There is one point , on which I want your advice . 5.179474679231212
' Ah ! 100.00000000000004
And do you really love him quite well enough ? 6.812920690579612
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 2.154434690031884
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . 3.1622776601683795
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . 1.425102670302998
Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 1.3433993325989002
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 3.8746751204561316
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 3.359818286283782
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 2.154434690031884
I have not been accustomed to such language as this . 5.878016072274914
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . 5.878016072274914
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . 2.2758459260747883
We must not all expect Jane ' s good fortune . " " True , " said Mr . Bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may <UNK> you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . " Mr . Wickham ' s society was of material service in <UNK> the gloom , which the late <UNK> occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family . 1.3111339374215643
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 1.5998587196060583
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W . 2.346228848142263
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent . 1.7301957388458942
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 3.359818286283782
And it was settled that we should all be there by <UNK> o ' clock . 3.593813663804627
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter . 1.8329807108324359
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 1.9684194472866121
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . 2.0535250264571463
And to be kept back on such a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . " " Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? " " With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . " Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . 1.213482767749144
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 1.4873521072935114
It is admirable ! " Elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 2.346228848142263
I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . 2.9935772947204895
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1.8047217668271702
<UNK> to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax <UNK> to the full extent permitted by U . S . federal laws and your state ' s laws . 2.0535250264571463
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . 1.8047217668271702
Every <UNK> <UNK> in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther <UNK> of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago <UNK> his <UNK> in the affair ; that proud and <UNK> as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had <UNK> brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be <UNK> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <UNK> or <UNK> habits . 1.2305240043592616
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . 2.8480358684358014
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . 2.9935772947204895
Oh , Lizzy ! 46.415888336127786
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! 3.1622776601683795
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . 1.8632463119315603
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 3.1622776601683795
<UNK> felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . 1.5441135899948315
I shall go distracted . " This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . 1.8329807108324359
sir , I do indeed . 17.78279410038923
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " This was invitation enough . 2.610157215682537
Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go . 2.1017480113324885
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest <UNK> , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any <UNK> display of regard , or any <UNK> of manner , where their two <UNK> only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 1.3708385261355818
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 1.8047217668271702
" What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut . 2.8480358684358014
If I were not afraid of judging <UNK> , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . 2.1017480113324885
Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . " " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . " " I believe , Ma ' am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . " " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . 1.2775649214671148
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . 3.359818286283782
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 2.0535250264571463
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s <UNK> . 2.51188643150958
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . 2.0535250264571463
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious <UNK> , denoted a recollection of Jane , not <UNK> by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . 1.4873521072935114
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . 6.812920690579612
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . 1.7082763938087104
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would <UNK> his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . 1.365007806546014
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <UNK> <UNK> her there . 3.359818286283782
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 2.2758459260747883
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 1.2589254117941673
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it . 2.346228848142263
The Miss <UNK> all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . Do you draw ? " " No , not at all . " " What , none of you ? " " Not one . " " That is very strange . 1.53174046370208
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 2.0092330025650473
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 2.7213387683753076
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . 4.641588833612778
Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , <UNK> that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ? 1.2154742500762865
Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with <UNK> civility that they were perfectly needless . 2.51188643150958
But are you pleased , Jane ? 12.915496650148839
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a <UNK> library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read <UNK> . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose <UNK> ' s <UNK> . 1.3830728955554412
They were within twenty <UNK> of each other , and so <UNK> was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . 2.346228848142263
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <UNK> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 1.4412195967188537
Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 3.593813663804627
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 3.593813663804627
I am so happy . 26.82695795279726
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 2.51188643150958
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 3.593813663804627
" Oh ! 100.00000000000004
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . 1.93069772888325
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! 2.0535250264571463
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 1.778279410038923
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . 5.179474679231212
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of <UNK> in that way . 3.359818286283782
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him . 3.8746751204561316
<UNK> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 2.2758459260747883
But no such recollection <UNK> her . 12.915496650148839
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 10.000000000000002
" How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet ! 4.216965034285822
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 3.1622776601683795
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is <UNK> the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken <UNK> , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . 1.2742749857031337
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in <UNK> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " said Jane as she finished it . 1.4585940117250362
They came . 100.00000000000004
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . 2.51188643150958
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . 2.2122162910704493
Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . 3.593813663804627
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 1.6496480740980204
" You quite <UNK> Mr . Darcy . 10.000000000000002
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . " " <UNK> out , " said Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 2.51188643150958
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 2.7213387683753076
That is the place to get husbands . 10.000000000000002
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . 2.346228848142263
Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 1.7301957388458942
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 1.4174741629268053
In , the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg tm and future generations . 2.346228848142263
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the <UNK> of my father ' s will , has been <UNK> acquainted with every particular of these transactions . 1.4873521072935114
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a <UNK> fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered <UNK> to the repeated <UNK> of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 1.2809343786525484
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . 2.0535250264571463
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . " <UNK> by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did . 1.4330125702369627
Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 6.812920690579612
Are the others coming out ? " " I do not know . 4.641588833612778
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in <UNK> affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? 1.8957356524063758
Elizabeth was <UNK> enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 2.610157215682537
and his sisters are charming women . 12.915496650148839
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 1.4677992676220695
Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at <UNK> , and Mrs . 4.216965034285822
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . 1.7301957388458942
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 1.3593563908785256
Mr . Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . 4.216965034285822
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 4.216965034285822
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . 1.6496480740980204
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 1.41011239906908
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " I have just received your letter , and shall <UNK> this whole morning to answering it , as I <UNK> that a little writing will not <UNK> what I have to tell you . 1.7301957388458942
" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . 2.4244620170823286
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . 5.179474679231212
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . 2.9935772947204895
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 1.8957356524063758
How I long to see her ! 12.915496650148839
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day <UNK> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . 1.5848931924611136
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
Lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . 1.9684194472866121
Well , much good may it do them ! 8.11130830789687
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 2.8480358684358014
Jane was not happy . 26.82695795279726
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 3.8746751204561316
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 1.6681005372000588
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn house . 5.179474679231212
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side . 5.179474679231212
Their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse . 3.593813663804627
He was <UNK> his memory with <UNK> and noble names . 5.878016072274914
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 1.1987818459583777
<UNK> the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it cannot be long . " He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . 1.3894954943731377
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . 3.359818286283782
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . 2.51188643150958
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 3.359818286283782
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 2.346228848142263
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 1.5085907086001784
They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . 1.4174741629268053
The hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 1.6681005372000588
" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the <UNK> <UNK> above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <UNK> than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . 1.221677348996792
Bennet . " My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received <UNK> at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right <UNK> Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose <UNK> and <UNK> has preferred me to the valuable <UNK> of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <UNK> myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those <UNK> and <UNK> which are <UNK> by the <UNK> of England . 1.2532543355087804
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 2.4244620170823286
" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said Mr . Gardiner . 3.359818286283782
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . 2.8480358684358014
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 2.9935772947204895
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey . 3.359818286283782
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
It was all conjecture . " " What is it you mean ? " " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing . " " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . " " And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . 1.324192791886045
" <UNK> . 100.00000000000004
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 1.93069772888325

But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 1.2742749857031337
It was very little less . 17.78279410038923
Of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was <UNK> with admiration was evident enough . 2.346228848142263
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . 2.0535250264571463
My feelings in every respect forbid it . 10.000000000000002
Collins and myself sincerely <UNK> with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the <UNK> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 1.778279410038923
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . 4.216965034285822
Good Heaven ! 100.00000000000004
<UNK> , teazing , man ! 17.78279410038923
I do not know who is good enough for him . " Mr . and Mrs . 3.359818286283782
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 8.11130830789687
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried . 4.641588833612778
You are a gentleman ' s daughter . 10.000000000000002
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . 1.5848931924611136
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 1.5848931924611136
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 3.359818286283782
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a <UNK> profit c <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under the laws of the state of <UNK> and <UNK> tax exempt status by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . 1.7082763938087104
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 6.812920690579612
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . 5.878016072274914
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . 10.000000000000002
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 5.878016072274914
Bennet , alarmed . 46.415888336127786
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 4.216965034285822
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . 3.593813663804627
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 1.93069772888325
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . 1.8329807108324359
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the <UNK> light , seemed most improbable . 2.9935772947204895
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 1.7301957388458942
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . 5.179474679231212
" And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 1.778279410038923
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 1.6876124757881477
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of <UNK> them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <UNK> , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the <UNK> kind . " She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <UNK> by any feeling of <UNK> . 1.2915496650148839
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . 3.1622776601683795
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 2.2758459260747883
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . 1.8957356524063758
If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was <UNK> done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . With respect to that other , more <UNK> <UNK> , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only <UNK> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 1.353876180022544
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 1.93069772888325
Have you had any flirting ? 17.78279410038923
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 3.359818286283782
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 1.6876124757881477
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 2.2122162910704493
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome . 1.7301957388458942
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 3.8746751204561316
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 2.2758459260747883
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . 2.4244620170823286
Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , <UNK> exclaimed , " Good Lord ! 2.0092330025650473
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to <UNK> such pleasures . 1.6681005372000588
It was agreed to . 26.82695795279726
CHAPTER <UNK> . 100.00000000000004
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 5.878016072274914
But what is that to me ? 12.915496650148839
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <UNK> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . 2.154434690031884
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . " Mrs . 3.1622776601683795
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . 1.8047217668271702
CHAPTER XVII . 100.00000000000004
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the <UNK> , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 1.396135390856794
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 6.812920690579612
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 2.1017480113324885
<UNK> wore a happier aspect . 17.78279410038923
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ' s <UNK> had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or <UNK> in him . 1.6496480740980204
" It certainly is a most <UNK> affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . 2.0535250264571463
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . 3.359818286283782
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 2.51188643150958
And what sort of young lady is she ? 8.11130830789687
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . 2.7213387683753076
In Three Volumes . 46.415888336127786
Many small donations to , are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . 1.4873521072935114
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! 3.359818286283782
" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? " said she . 4.641588833612778
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 8.11130830789687
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open <UNK> rejected . 2.2122162910704493
Such a disappointment ! 46.415888336127786
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do ! 4.216965034285822
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 1.6876124757881477
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . 2.8480358684358014
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 8.11130830789687
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to <UNK> the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 2.0535250264571463
But papa is so disagreeable . " " A little <UNK> bathing would set me up for ever . " " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty . 1.7082763938087104
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <UNK> to her <UNK> , afforded no <UNK> of her distress . 2.154434690031884
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . 2.4244620170823286
If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 2.4244620170823286
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 5.179474679231212
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 1.338388753173757
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! How much of good or evil must be done by him ! 1.5706464294715548
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . " " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . " Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . 1.41011239906908
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
The Foundation ' s <UNK> or federal tax <UNK> number is . 5.179474679231212
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 2.4244620170823286
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
" They are going to be <UNK> near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! 2.346228848142263
Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately . 8.11130830789687
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew . 5.878016072274914
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 1.353876180022544
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . 1.9684194472866121
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . " " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley . 1.7534865500829584
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so . 2.346228848142263
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . 8.11130830789687
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be <UNK> at , and it was rather too early to begin . 2.610157215682537
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , Mrs . 3.359818286283782
Lydia <UNK> as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very <UNK> solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips <UNK> of turning away <UNK> , and if he does , Colonel Forster will <UNK> him . 1.4977474763452014
. 2154.4346900318833
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been <UNK> by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 1.7534865500829584
Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . 3.593813663804627
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <UNK> the excellent understanding , and <UNK> excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 1.2843862635897427
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 3.593813663804627
And , besides , no <UNK> of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then supposing them to be in London . 2.1017480113324885
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . 5.878016072274914
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . 4.216965034285822
It was not all settled before Monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . 2.7213387683753076
Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . 4.216965034285822
How is such a man to be worked on ? 6.812920690579612
And what sort of table do they keep ? 8.11130830789687
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . 8.11130830789687
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! 6.812920690579612
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 1.557068404753731
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of <UNK> , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than <UNK> anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 1.5199110829529336
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 1.425102670302998
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 1.8957356524063758
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . 2.346228848142263
" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . 1.557068404753731
" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself . 2.610157215682537
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months . 1.4330125702369627
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 1.2451970847350329
Four nieces of Mrs . 26.82695795279726
I never saw such <UNK> , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " Mrs . 2.4244620170823286
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 2.0092330025650473
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 1.7082763938087104
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can <UNK> a woman . " " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? 1.4497406703726319
I was never more <UNK> ! 17.78279410038923
She was busily <UNK> through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . 1.8329807108324359
Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her . 2.4244620170823286
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 1.1708281368909708
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 2.51188643150958
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . 1.778279410038923
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 5.878016072274914
Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 1.4174741629268053
They had frequently been staying with her in town . 6.812920690579612
Only look at her . 26.82695795279726
I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . 4.216965034285822
Kitty and Lydia were far from <UNK> Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . 1.778279410038923

Such a countenance , such manners ! 12.915496650148839
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! 2.8480358684358014
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . 1.53174046370208
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Bennet ' s civilities . 26.82695795279726
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please . 2.346228848142263
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . 1.2077226551344626
I will read it to you " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles <UNK> to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <UNK> <UNK> . 1.2775649214671148
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 2.4244620170823286
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen . 3.8746751204561316
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . " He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 1.2352165993694857
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . 3.1622776601683795
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 1.2990813969063477
My sisters may write to me . 12.915496650148839
But I am at his disposal . 12.915496650148839
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 4.216965034285822
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . 3.8746751204561316
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 1.7082763938087104
The old lady is Mrs . 17.78279410038923
He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father ' s intentions . 1.396135390856794
You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . 2.8480358684358014
I will try again . 26.82695795279726
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
It would have suited me in every respect . " " How should you have liked making sermons ? " " <UNK> well . 2.4244620170823286
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 2.51188643150958
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . 2.4244620170823286
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . 2.610157215682537
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 1.3894954943731377
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 4.641588833612778
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 2.1017480113324885
And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
She directly replied , " You need not be frightened . 5.878016072274914
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 1.5848931924611136
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ' s performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste . 2.7213387683753076
They <UNK> every attempt of Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 3.359818286283782
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . 5.878016072274914
" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently . 3.1622776601683795
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . 1.6681005372000588
They must be a great loss to your family . " In Darcy ' s presence she dared not mention Wickham ' s name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <UNK> in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , <UNK> herself <UNK> to <UNK> the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . 1.3485595530525598
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 2.8480358684358014
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . 1.6876124757881477
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . 4.216965034285822
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 5.878016072274914
" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt . 2.346228848142263
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and <UNK> study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . " And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his <UNK> she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . 1.302994338575022
But now it was all too natural . 10.000000000000002
" My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . " They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . " " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence . " " You cannot be too much on your guard . 1.1537502316781654
How was that possible ? 26.82695795279726
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 1.4585940117250362
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . 2.2758459260747883
" Oh , yes ! if one could but go to Brighton ! 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . 6.812920690579612
You supposed more than really existed . 12.915496650148839
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 1.8047217668271702
Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c . 2.2758459260747883
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . 1.5441135899948315
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over . 2.2758459260747883
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 2.610157215682537
Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . 6.812920690579612
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and <UNK> . 1.8329807108324359
" Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " From the former . 1.778279410038923
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 1.7301957388458942
If I could but see you as happy ! 8.11130830789687
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . " " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? " " Indeed I had . 1.8632463119315603
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . 2.4244620170823286
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . 2.346228848142263
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 1.4773776525985112
GARDINER . " " Is it possible ! " cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . 3.359818286283782
what could she mean by it ? 12.915496650148839
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 2.2122162910704493
But , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . 2.610157215682537
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and <UNK> pass away . 1.8632463119315603
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . 5.179474679231212
They will ruin your happiness . 17.78279410038923
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! 3.8746751204561316
Long has promised to introduce him . " " I do not believe Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . 2.346228848142263
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . 1.5441135899948315
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 1.615598098439874
yes , " said Elizabeth drily " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a <UNK> deal of care of him . " " <UNK> of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care . 1.5085907086001784
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> . 2.610157215682537
Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began . 1.557068404753731
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 1.28792362543363
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . " " No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me . 1.53174046370208

" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not <UNK> declare that Caroline neither <UNK> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <UNK> the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly ! to put me on my guard ? 1.4412195967188537
From what can it proceed ? 17.78279410038923
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 1.632172128563275
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <UNK> , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the <UNK> way for happiness . 1.3593563908785256
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . 1.778279410038923
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <UNK> as these , what would have been her sensations ? 2.2758459260747883
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling . 1.6496480740980204
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . 4.641588833612778
<UNK> more than half a day ' s journey . 6.812920690579612
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . 1.8329807108324359
I have no such <UNK> to resent . 10.000000000000002
Charles , when you <UNK> your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 1.5441135899948315
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 1.4677992676220695
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 2.0535250264571463
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . 1.615598098439874
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 6.812920690579612
<UNK> the Foundation as set forth in Section below . 6.812920690579612
Gardiner smiled . 100.00000000000004
The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 3.593813663804627
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . 2.610157215682537
" You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . 4.641588833612778
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 2.346228848142263
" Good Heaven ! 46.415888336127786
If she does not object to it , why should we ? " " Her not objecting , does not justify him . 2.51188643150958
Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach . 2.4244620170823286
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . 5.179474679231212
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . 4.641588833612778
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . 1.93069772888325
He had never had the slightest suspicion . 10.000000000000002
In the hall they parted . 17.78279410038923
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 1.93069772888325
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 4.216965034285822
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a <UNK> ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 1.5085907086001784
I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . 3.1622776601683795
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 1.8632463119315603
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . 3.593813663804627
How he lived I know not . 12.915496650148839
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 1.8957356524063758
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 1.8957356524063758
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . 2.9935772947204895
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 2.7213387683753076
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 1.4497406703726319
If you are outside the United States , check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before <UNK> , copying , displaying , performing , distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg tm work . 1.5848931924611136
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 1.41011239906908
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 2.2122162910704493
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . 2.9935772947204895
" Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated . 4.216965034285822
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in <UNK> , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . 1.302994338575022
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 1.4677992676220695
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . 1.53174046370208
I will read you the passage which particularly <UNK> me . 5.878016072274914
She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 5.878016072274914
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word . 3.8746751204561316
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . 2.2758459260747883
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at Longbourn . 2.4244620170823286
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . 4.216965034285822
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 4.216965034285822
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 5.878016072274914
They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins ' s admiration . 4.216965034285822
I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . " " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . 1.4873521072935114
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 1.6496480740980204
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . 1.5441135899948315
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . 2.2122162910704493
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . 2.51188643150958
They were to be off as soon as possible . 6.812920690579612
A lively imagination soon settled it all . 10.000000000000002
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 2.0535250264571463
If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 1.8632463119315603
Annesley is with her . 26.82695795279726
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . " The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . 1.8047217668271702
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 1.5848931924611136
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 1.93069772888325
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 1.7082763938087104
" There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London . 1.632172128563275
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . 2.2122162910704493
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 4.641588833612778
" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party . 2.0535250264571463
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . " Elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! 1.7534865500829584
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 1.778279410038923
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . 1.7301957388458942
The first week of their return was soon gone . 6.812920690579612
<UNK> , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . 1.6496480740980204
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . 1.93069772888325
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . 3.1622776601683795
" My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . " But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . 1.28792362543363
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 4.641588833612778
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 10.000000000000002
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish . 1.1937766417144364
<UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 2.4244620170823286
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage . 2.610157215682537
She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <UNK> him with fears and regrets in <UNK> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 1.2915496650148839
But the case is this . 17.78279410038923
" What could he mean ? 17.78279410038923
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much . 5.179474679231212
I enquired after their brother , of course . 8.11130830789687
do not repeat what I then said . 10.000000000000002
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 1.7301957388458942
" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . 6.812920690579612
<UNK> was the least of her feelings on this developement . 5.878016072274914
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 2.7213387683753076
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 1.93069772888325
" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 6.812920690579612
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ' s two sisters . 1.6876124757881477
I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to <UNK> such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room . 1.4773776525985112
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <UNK> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 1.4497406703726319
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . 2.1017480113324885
He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would <UNK> more birds on the first of <UNK> , than any body else in the country . 1.9684194472866121
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . " It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . 1.5998587196060583
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 1.778279410038923
Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . " After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! 1.4330125702369627
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell <UNK> to mend a great <UNK> in my worked muslin gown , before they are <UNK> up . 1.8329807108324359
That his anger could be carried to such a point of <UNK> resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem <UNK> , exceeded all that she could believe possible . 1.7534865500829584
. F . . Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph . F . , this work is provided to you ' <UNK> <UNK> ' , <UNK> NO <UNK> WARRANTIES OF ANY <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF <UNK> OR <UNK> FOR ANY <UNK> . 1.4677992676220695
You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " " You mistake me , my dear . 3.1622776601683795
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed ! 5.179474679231212
I promised them so <UNK> ! 17.78279410038923
If there were but such another man for you ! " " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . 2.0092330025650473
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 1.632172128563275
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 6.812920690579612
" What will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are ! 2.9935772947204895
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 3.593813663804627
It is a pity they are not handsome ! 8.11130830789687
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . 5.179474679231212
Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . 1.7301957388458942
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . 1.5085907086001784
" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried Jane . 3.593813663804627
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . " " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 1.778279410038923
Pray do not talk of that odious man . 8.11130830789687
Younge was of course removed from her charge . 8.11130830789687
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! 3.8746751204561316
He knows where we live . 17.78279410038923
In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . 5.878016072274914
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ' s regiment . " His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative . 1.557068404753731
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 1.7534865500829584
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? 5.878016072274914
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 2.154434690031884
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way . 2.8480358684358014
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . 1.8632463119315603
Lady Catherine was <UNK> proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her . 2.51188643150958
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . 3.359818286283782
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 1.557068404753731
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
I shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will <UNK> and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " Elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 1.1830216722875087
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . 2.8480358684358014
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 3.8746751204561316
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 1.615598098439874
<UNK> was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . 1.778279410038923
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . 10.000000000000002
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 1.5998587196060583
As no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins ' s scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon <UNK> deliberation , you find that the misery of <UNK> his two sisters is more than <UNK> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . " " How can you talk so ? " said Jane <UNK> smiling , " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . " " I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . " " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 1.1380983017100623
Gardiner . 316.22776601683796
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 1.7534865500829584
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . 2.610157215682537
<UNK> recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . 2.610157215682537
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . 2.4244620170823286
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <UNK> manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . 2.0092330025650473
" Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . 3.593813663804627
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . 2.346228848142263
<UNK> has she condescended to give me her opinion <UNK> too ! on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our <UNK> at quadrille , while Mrs . 1.8047217668271702
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . 3.593813663804627
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 3.359818286283782
I am perfectly satisfied . 26.82695795279726
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
You have done all this ! 17.78279410038923
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 1.4412195967188537
The discussion of Mr . Collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . 1.7301957388458942
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 3.1622776601683795
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself . 1.7534865500829584
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr . Darcy . She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! Yet it did , and even a third . 1.3111339374215643
CHAPTER V . 100.00000000000004
The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . 2.2758459260747883
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 1.8957356524063758
I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a <UNK> up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 2.1017480113324885
Bennet . 316.22776601683796
but there were two or three much <UNK> in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to <UNK> it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . 1.8632463119315603
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 3.8746751204561316
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not <UNK> me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . 1.4330125702369627
Elizabeth hoped she had <UNK> him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 2.346228848142263
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . 2.51188643150958
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . " " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . " " Pride , " observed Mary , who <UNK> herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe . 1.3830728955554412
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . 1.5441135899948315
Elizabeth merely <UNK> to him , without saying a word . 5.878016072274914
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , <UNK> over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in <UNK> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 1.3830728955554412
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as <UNK> of derivative works , <UNK> , <UNK> and research . 2.610157215682537
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 2.9935772947204895
' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! What , all five out at once ? 1.557068404753731
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . 1.353876180022544
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments . 2.4244620170823286
But our visitor was very obstinate . 12.915496650148839
He leaves out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <UNK> . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must <UNK> reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility . 1.333521432163324
They all <UNK> tables , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed . 1.3768571648527583
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 1.5441135899948315
You do not look well . 17.78279410038923
London Printed for T . 26.82695795279726
I had not an idea of it . " Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . 1.8329807108324359
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 2.2758459260747883
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might <UNK> to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . 1.5085907086001784
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 2.8480358684358014
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane . 5.878016072274914
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 1.6876124757881477
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <UNK> , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 1.4174741629268053
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she . 4.216965034285822
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . 1.93069772888325
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 1.2352165993694857
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? 2.610157215682537
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s t te t te with Mrs . 2.2758459260747883
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 6.812920690579612
CHAPTER XVII . 100.00000000000004
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <UNK> of my son in law . 1.8632463119315603
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 1.615598098439874
are sufficiently known . 46.415888336127786
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 1.4977474763452014
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 2.610157215682537
They will never be distressed for money . 10.000000000000002
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 1.8047217668271702
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 2.7213387683753076
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . 2.8480358684358014
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 1.5085907086001784
" I did not know that you intended to walk , " said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . 2.2758459260747883
She blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . 2.2122162910704493
You see how continually we are engaged there . 8.11130830789687
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been <UNK> , and it had actually been <UNK> that Colonel Forster was going to be married . 1.557068404753731
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . 3.8746751204561316
Where shall you change horses ? Oh ! 10.000000000000002
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <UNK> , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . 1.9684194472866121
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 2.4244620170823286
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 1.632172128563275
I had not believed it possible . " " I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth . 3.1622776601683795
Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> . 1.7301957388458942
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 4.641588833612778
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . " <UNK> ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 1.9684194472866121
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity . 1.9684194472866121
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had <UNK> <UNK> only four months ago , would now have been <UNK> and gratefully received ! 1.8329807108324359
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation . 1.4412195967188537
One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 1.4412195967188537
Oh , Lord ! 46.415888336127786
But who was your mother ? 17.78279410038923
Miss Bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . 4.216965034285822
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 1.3111339374215643
She was going to the <UNK> ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of <UNK> , just fit to be killed . " Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . 1.4977474763452014
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse . 8.11130830789687
" Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . 3.593813663804627
and so did Mrs . 26.82695795279726
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 3.8746751204561316
" I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . " " Who do you mean , my dear ? 1.4585940117250362
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 2.51188643150958
And what do you think she said besides ? 8.11130830789687
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , soon collected them round the table . 1.7082763938087104

" When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! I who knew what he was . 2.0092330025650473
This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham . 1.615598098439874
" His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . 5.179474679231212
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . 3.8746751204561316
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 2.2122162910704493
Teaze him laugh at him . <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . " " But upon my honour I do not . 2.0092330025650473
Good gracious ! 100.00000000000004
They agreed that Mrs . 26.82695795279726
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . 1.5199110829529336
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . 2.7213387683753076
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . 6.812920690579612
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> . 2.0092330025650473
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 2.0535250264571463
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed . 1.5199110829529336
Her ladyship was highly incensed . 17.78279410038923
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? 3.593813663804627
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . 1.425102670302998
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . 1.632172128563275
You know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . 3.1622776601683795
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 1.324192791886045
Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . 2.9935772947204895
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . 2.0535250264571463
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she <UNK> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . " Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . 1.365007806546014

Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your <UNK> . " " I should imagine not . " " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . 1.353876180022544
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 2.154434690031884
" He seems to be a most <UNK> and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so <UNK> as to let him come to us again . " " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . " " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . " Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of <UNK> , marrying , and <UNK> his <UNK> whenever it were required . 1.164729742018898
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 1.8329807108324359
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference . 5.179474679231212
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 3.359818286283782

Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its <UNK> , to think of any thing else . 1.4873521072935114
Mr . Bennet ' s <UNK> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! 1.3894954943731377
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 6.812920690579612
" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . 1.8047217668271702
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 1.396135390856794
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 1.6681005372000588
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . " It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . 1.7082763938087104
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 2.9935772947204895
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <UNK> , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room . 1.8047217668271702
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . 1.7301957388458942
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . 1.4677992676220695
I know we dine with four and twenty families . " Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could <UNK> Bingley to keep his countenance . 2.4244620170823286
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . Oh ! 4.216965034285822
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . " The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they <UNK> satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had <UNK> Mrs . 1.3830728955554412
<UNK> as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . 5.878016072274914
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission . 2.2758459260747883
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 3.1622776601683795
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 2.2758459260747883
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 3.593813663804627
In ran Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Had Elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . 2.1017480113324885
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 2.154434690031884
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 2.0535250264571463
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . 1.9684194472866121
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . 1.7301957388458942
It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . 3.359818286283782
Wickham is safe . " " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . " " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane . 1.4497406703726319
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . 1.8047217668271702
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the <UNK> of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . 1.41011239906908
That he was surprised by the <UNK> was evident ; he <UNK> it however with <UNK> , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner . 1.778279410038923
" I cannot make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by <UNK> for being next in the entail ? We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " No , my dear ; I think not . 1.4330125702369627
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 1.8957356524063758
It is unaccountable ! 46.415888336127786
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . 1.9684194472866121
Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <UNK> . 1.4773776525985112
" Gracechurch street , <UNK> . 17.78279410038923
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 1.2775649214671148
<UNK> for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public <UNK> , but I wrote to Mr . Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . 1.2096079377043663
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 5.878016072274914
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
But does not Jane <UNK> with the sister ? 8.11130830789687
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . 2.1017480113324885
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . " She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . " Again his astonishment was <UNK> ; and he looked at her with an expression of <UNK> incredulity and mortification . 1.1547819846894583
An union of a different tendency , and <UNK> the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . 2.4244620170823286
" <UNK> Oh ! 46.415888336127786
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . " " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . 2.154434690031884
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . 1.6496480740980204
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate . 1.7082763938087104
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
No one but Mrs . 26.82695795279726
" I am trying to make it out . " " And what is your success ? " She shook her head . 2.51188643150958
Georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . 1.5848931924611136
Let Wickham be your man . 17.78279410038923
Give me farther particulars . 26.82695795279726
<UNK> check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and addresses . 4.216965034285822
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence . 1.4977474763452014
how I wanted you ! " " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . " " Certainly . 1.7534865500829584
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 3.593813663804627
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . 1.8632463119315603
I am glad he <UNK> here on Tuesday . 8.11130830789687
But , Lizzy ! 46.415888336127786
" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . 2.610157215682537
My feelings will not be repressed . 12.915496650148839
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . 2.610157215682537
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so <UNK> ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and <UNK> , " Let me call your maid . 1.53174046370208
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 3.8746751204561316
here comes Hill . 46.415888336127786
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . 3.8746751204561316
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well . 4.216965034285822
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 2.2122162910704493
My father bears it better . 17.78279410038923
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 4.216965034285822
She is well , and <UNK> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . Your ' s , c . 2.610157215682537
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . 6.812920690579612
She could think only of her letter . 10.000000000000002
I cannot quite agree with you there . 10.000000000000002
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 1.7082763938087104
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 2.2758459260747883
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . 1.2843862635897427
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing . 2.0535250264571463
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . 1.557068404753731
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 1.7301957388458942
CHAPTER XII . 100.00000000000004
<UNK> nature is so prone to fall into it ! 6.812920690579612
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 4.641588833612778
That such a consequence as this should <UNK> , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . " " When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . " " Not the slightest . 1.5199110829529336
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 1.5441135899948315
It was unpardonable . 46.415888336127786
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 3.593813663804627
When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . 2.154434690031884
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not <UNK> their own , so much the better . 2.610157215682537
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
I congratulate her . 46.415888336127786
Believe her to be deceived by all means . 8.11130830789687
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world . 2.610157215682537
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 2.610157215682537
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North . 2.0092330025650473
<UNK> and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was <UNK> and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . 1.9684194472866121
" Not at all . 26.82695795279726
On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . 2.610157215682537
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason . 1.5998587196060583
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 1.5998587196060583
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . 1.6876124757881477
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself . 1.5998587196060583
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . 1.425102670302998
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished . 3.359818286283782
" Let us sit down . 17.78279410038923
Her report was highly favourable . 17.78279410038923
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal . " " True . 2.51188643150958
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 1.7301957388458942
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to <UNK> ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . 2.0535250264571463
Their manners are not equal to his . " " Certainly not ; at first . 3.593813663804627
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips . 4.216965034285822
oh ! 316.22776601683796
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 1.9684194472866121
Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar . 1.7301957388458942
<UNK> and <UNK> support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg tm ' s <UNK> and <UNK> that the Project Gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come . 1.7534865500829584

Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! 2.7213387683753076
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her <UNK> being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 1.365007806546014
I send no compliments to your mother . 10.000000000000002
Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . 2.7213387683753076
They must all go to Brighton . 12.915496650148839
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been <UNK> , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . 1.7301957388458942
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 1.7082763938087104
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . 1.4330125702369627
We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . 2.154434690031884
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . 1.4977474763452014
It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . " " Oh ! 1.8632463119315603
My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his <UNK> in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . 1.365007806546014
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . 8.11130830789687
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 1.7534865500829584
For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . 1.778279410038923
Your mother <UNK> upon your accepting it . 10.000000000000002
He does not want abilities . 17.78279410038923
I am very , very sorry . 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 2.346228848142263
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . 1.6876124757881477
" It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . 2.8480358684358014
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 2.610157215682537
There was also a <UNK> of one thousand pounds . 6.812920690579612
It must be an amusing study . " " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing . 2.9935772947204895
Their fortune on both sides is splendid . 10.000000000000002
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it . 3.1622776601683795
And then we were so merry all the way home ! 5.878016072274914
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 1.365007806546014
Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . 3.359818286283782
On Saturday he came again . 17.78279410038923
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother How is she ? 2.1017480113324885
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had . 1.6496480740980204
how unlucky ! 100.00000000000004
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs . 1.7301957388458942
These recollections will not do at all . 10.000000000000002
They were natural and just . 17.78279410038923
" I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the <UNK> and public places . 2.4244620170823286
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . 2.2758459260747883
I have not that pain . 17.78279410038923
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 3.8746751204561316
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the <UNK> kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . 1.8957356524063758
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 1.5199110829529336
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . 2.2758459260747883
She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . 1.41011239906908
Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment . 8.11130830789687
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
