<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 10.000000000000002
The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 1.5848931924611136
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 6.812920690579612
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 2.1017480113324885
" He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . 2.51188643150958
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . 1.4585940117250362
my dear , " continued Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 4.216965034285822
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 1.3768571648527583
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 1.6681005372000588
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity . 1.4174741629268053
Does your charge give you much trouble ? 6.812920690579612
Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their <UNK> their income . 2.346228848142263
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! 3.359818286283782
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 2.51188643150958
" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 1.93069772888325
Here , <UNK> , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . 2.7213387683753076
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . 2.7213387683753076
Mr . what ' s his name . 6.812920690579612
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 1.93069772888325
The <UNK> would be spoilt by <UNK> a fourth . 5.179474679231212
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <UNK> by the possessor , and often without any attention to the <UNK> of the performance . 2.0535250264571463
That is all settled . " " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . 2.154434690031884
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for <UNK> him also with Lizzy . 2.2122162910704493
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . 2.346228848142263
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 1.8957356524063758
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 2.8480358684358014
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 1.5085907086001784
I told my sister Philips so the other day . 5.179474679231212
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 1.41011239906908
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week . 1.615598098439874
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them . " This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret . 1.338388753173757
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <UNK> . 1.6681005372000588
" And this is always the way with him , " she added . " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . 1.8957356524063758
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 2.4244620170823286
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 2.4244620170823286
The journey would moreover give her a <UNK> at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . 1.8957356524063758
Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to <UNK> . 1.7301957388458942
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . " Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . 1.4030037231905736
" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . " " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . " Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . 1.324192791886045
Bennet one communication would , therefore , do for all . 4.641588833612778
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more . 4.216965034285822
But papa is so disagreeable . " " A little <UNK> bathing would set me up for ever . " " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty . 1.6681005372000588
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took <UNK> in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 1.9684194472866121
Elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 1.5848931924611136
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 1.53174046370208
Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon <UNK> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 1.8632463119315603
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . 3.359818286283782
Philips first brought her the news . " Well , so much the better . 3.359818286283782
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 3.8746751204561316
But I know the foundation is unjust . 6.812920690579612
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford <UNK> , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 1.4497406703726319
<UNK> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 2.154434690031884
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . 2.8480358684358014
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings . 1.8957356524063758
So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 2.610157215682537
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 1.5199110829529336
in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 2.346228848142263
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 1.557068404753731
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 4.216965034285822
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <UNK> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
Dear , dear Lizzy . 12.915496650148839
" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam . 2.8480358684358014
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that <UNK> is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . 1.53174046370208
But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . " " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " Yes . 1.6496480740980204
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <UNK> of a bad day . 2.154434690031884
that he had <UNK> his <UNK> in the first dance ! " " Oh ! 3.359818286283782
Gardiner , though unknown . 12.915496650148839
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general <UNK> to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . 1.5706464294715548
Who are your uncles and <UNK> ? 8.11130830789687
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of <UNK> from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a <UNK> horse . 1.93069772888325
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 2.51188643150958
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 2.610157215682537
Other schemes too came into her head . 6.812920690579612
When they repaired to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 1.7534865500829584
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 3.8746751204561316
A <UNK> life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . 2.7213387683753076
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . 1.778279410038923
I am sure you will be very comfortable there . 5.179474679231212
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 2.154434690031884
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . 1.615598098439874
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 1.8632463119315603
They were to be off as soon as possible . 5.179474679231212
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and <UNK> pass away . 1.8047217668271702
Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and <UNK> its extent . 3.8746751204561316
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room . 1.8957356524063758
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . 1.6681005372000588
Bennet . 46.415888336127786
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat <UNK> attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must <UNK> every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <UNK> . 1.3768571648527583
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . " Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . 1.8047217668271702
" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the <UNK> that is laid on them , as nonsense ? 2.51188643150958
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 1.8329807108324359
What shall we do with him ? 8.11130830789687
" Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . 1.396135390856794
You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! 3.8746751204561316
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 3.359818286283782
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 2.2122162910704493
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw <UNK> in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . 1.4030037231905736
" And pray may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a <UNK> tone , " Is it in address that he improves ? 2.0535250264571463
If the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the <UNK> . 2.346228848142263
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 4.641588833612778
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy . 1.8957356524063758
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him . 3.359818286283782
She has a very good notion of <UNK> , though her taste is not equal to Anne ' s . 2.610157215682537
They are my old friends . 10.000000000000002
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 3.593813663804627
Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently . 6.812920690579612
Most earnestly did she <UNK> to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . 2.346228848142263
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 1.8047217668271702
Such were the gentle <UNK> of Mrs . 6.812920690579612
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? " Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . 1.778279410038923
But I confess they would have no charms for me . 4.641588833612778
Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . 3.593813663804627
I write without any intention of <UNK> you , or <UNK> myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the <UNK> , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . 1.396135390856794
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 1.3830728955554412
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have <UNK> domestic felicity in so <UNK> a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . 1.2915496650148839
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater <UNK> concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being <UNK> by <UNK> , <UNK> inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . 1.632172128563275
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . 1.4773776525985112
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 1.5706464294715548
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . " " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be <UNK> with . 1.5706464294715548
The moral will be perfectly fair . 8.11130830789687
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . 2.8480358684358014
" Your affectionate friend , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " Oh ! 3.8746751204561316
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 4.641588833612778
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " CHAPTER <UNK> . 1.615598098439874

He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . 1.8632463119315603
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the <UNK> of a considerable <UNK> , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . 1.4977474763452014
I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . 2.51188643150958
I ought not to have said a word about it . 4.641588833612778
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not . 1.8329807108324359
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 2.2758459260747883
and so did Mrs . 12.915496650148839
I was never more <UNK> ! 10.000000000000002
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . 2.2122162910704493
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 2.346228848142263
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 1.4773776525985112
<UNK> wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . 1.5998587196060583
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . 2.1017480113324885
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 1.632172128563275
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 3.359818286283782
Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not <UNK> . 1.8957356524063758
You must contrive to send somebody . 8.11130830789687
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 1.4412195967188537
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! 1.5199110829529336
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over . 2.154434690031884
On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . 2.4244620170823286
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . 1.8329807108324359
Annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs . 1.7301957388458942
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <UNK> with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 1.9684194472866121
CHAPTER II . 26.82695795279726
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 6.812920690579612
I congratulate her . 17.78279410038923
Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 1.333521432163324
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . 1.5848931924611136
You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not . 3.8746751204561316
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . " " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . 1.53174046370208
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <UNK> them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 1.5848931924611136
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . 3.8746751204561316
I shall see her in January . 8.11130830789687
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . 2.610157215682537
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . 2.2122162910704493
I shall never forget her appearance this morning . 5.878016072274914
Mr . Darcy ! 17.78279410038923
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 1.8957356524063758
He is come Mr . Bingley is come . He is , indeed . 3.593813663804627
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . 1.8047217668271702
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 2.0535250264571463
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . 5.179474679231212
Very well . 26.82695795279726
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . " " In what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought Elizabeth . 1.8329807108324359
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , <UNK> from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and <UNK> by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 1.3485595530525598
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 1.9684194472866121
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , <UNK> , manner of talking to her brother . 1.7534865500829584
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . " " I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which <UNK> in <UNK> a respectable man . 1.3708385261355818
It was the last of the regiment ' s stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were <UNK> <UNK> . 2.2122162910704493
Bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone . 5.179474679231212
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 2.154434690031884
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 2.4244620170823286
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 12.915496650148839
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left <UNK> , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . 1.2175031274276027
Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . 1.8329807108324359
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . 1.5199110829529336
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <UNK> from the marriage of her sisters . 2.8480358684358014
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 2.9935772947204895
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
It must be his own doing . He is his own master . 3.8746751204561316
On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . 1.2843862635897427

it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . 1.9684194472866121
When they were all in the drawing room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . 1.7534865500829584
You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " " You mistake me , my dear . 2.8480358684358014
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . " Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative . 1.5199110829529336
I never was . 17.78279410038923
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 1.5199110829529336
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library . " Mrs . 1.1954168684575872
<UNK> on Jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy ' s explanation , by <UNK> Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 1.7082763938087104
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 2.346228848142263
Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . " After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! 1.4174741629268053
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . 2.7213387683753076
I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! 2.0092330025650473
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 1.4585940117250362
From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . 1.4497406703726319
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . 3.8746751204561316
He placed himself by her . 10.000000000000002
What is it you are talking of ? 6.812920690579612
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 2.610157215682537
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . 2.8480358684358014
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs . 4.641588833612778
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 1.2809343786525484
I must have employment and society . 8.11130830789687
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . 1.8329807108324359
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 3.359818286283782
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 1.3433993325989002

" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . 2.346228848142263
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 1.6496480740980204
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . " " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal <UNK> of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first <UNK> for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . 1.2710617996147449
The express was sent off directly . 8.11130830789687
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <UNK> <UNK> . 1.93069772888325
Bennet , was not so well pleased with it . 5.179474679231212
I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time . 2.2758459260747883
To Mrs . 26.82695795279726
Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 2.0535250264571463
Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . 1.8957356524063758
CHAPTER XII . 26.82695795279726
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 1.4497406703726319
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 1.4497406703726319
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . " " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 1.4497406703726319
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 1.8632463119315603
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . 3.1622776601683795
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . " " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . " Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . 1.396135390856794
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners <UNK> respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 1.53174046370208
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! 3.1622776601683795
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . " " If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . 1.4174741629268053
They contained no actual <UNK> , nor was there any <UNK> of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 2.4244620170823286
But self , though it would intrude , could not <UNK> her . 3.8746751204561316
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . 1.93069772888325
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
Bennet said only , " <UNK> , nonsense ! " " What can be the meaning of that <UNK> exclamation ? " cried he . 2.2122162910704493
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ' s height , or rather <UNK> . " " How I long to see her again ! 2.2122162910704493
His character was decided . 12.915496650148839
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! 2.7213387683753076
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 1.7082763938087104
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 2.610157215682537
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . 2.0535250264571463
Good girl ! 26.82695795279726
Her answer , therefore , was not <UNK> , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . 2.154434690031884
Her father <UNK> by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and <UNK> mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . 1.5441135899948315
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? 2.8480358684358014
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach . 1.7534865500829584
" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . 1.8957356524063758
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . 1.8957356524063758
She will be down in a moment I dare say . " He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 1.8329807108324359
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
CHAPTER XIX . 26.82695795279726
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a <UNK> , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , <UNK> to Kitty and Lydia . 1.4873521072935114
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 1.8632463119315603
Jane <UNK> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour . 1.4773776525985112
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 1.9684194472866121
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! 2.610157215682537
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister . 2.0535250264571463
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 3.8746751204561316
" This will not do , " said Elizabeth . 5.179474679231212
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 1.4585940117250362
" John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? " " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 1.7534865500829584
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 3.359818286283782
<UNK> and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was <UNK> and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . 1.8957356524063758
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 2.4244620170823286
The other is Miss De Bourgh . 8.11130830789687
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . 2.0535250264571463
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 1.2505106035854068
We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation . 2.51188643150958
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . 3.359818286283782
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 1.425102670302998
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 1.6876124757881477
Bingley was the principal <UNK> , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 3.8746751204561316
" There is nothing the matter with me . 5.878016072274914
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . 1.8047217668271702
It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 1.53174046370208
Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the <UNK> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . 1.3768571648527583
I have a high respect for your nerves . 5.878016072274914
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 2.346228848142263
Yes , I call it a very easy distance . " " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth . 1.8957356524063758
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 1.8957356524063758
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child . 2.154434690031884
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 1.53174046370208
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 2.9935772947204895

" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . " Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . 1.5199110829529336
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 2.9935772947204895
Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend . 2.346228848142263
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 4.216965034285822

She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . " Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where Mrs . 1.2532543355087804
My aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . " " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . 1.5848931924611136

Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 1.2401035305418566
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . 3.359818286283782
Every <UNK> <UNK> in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther <UNK> of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago <UNK> his <UNK> in the affair ; that proud and <UNK> as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had <UNK> brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be <UNK> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <UNK> or <UNK> habits . 1.2260144114527525
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 1.6876124757881477
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . 1.1954168684575872
Bennet very dull for several days . 8.11130830789687
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 1.778279410038923
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . 3.1622776601683795

In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <UNK> by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . 1.53174046370208
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . 1.4773776525985112
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . " " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 1.4773776525985112
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 2.2758459260747883

I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 1.8329807108324359
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I <UNK> believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . 1.4174741629268053
She performed her part indeed without much <UNK> , but Mrs . 4.216965034285822
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 1.5848931924611136
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley is not he ? 3.359818286283782
I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . 1.396135390856794
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 1.8632463119315603
Such was Miss Lucas ' s scheme ; and <UNK> were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . 1.6876124757881477
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 1.3433993325989002

Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " Their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . 1.2809343786525484

Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 1.615598098439874
Sir William did not say much . 8.11130830789687
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be <UNK> so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . 2.0092330025650473
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 1.4412195967188537
He was the <UNK> , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . 2.2758459260747883
After <UNK> their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ? 1.93069772888325

You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . 2.9935772947204895
Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time . 3.8746751204561316
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention . 3.8746751204561316
A fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . 5.179474679231212
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . 3.1622776601683795
" And that , " said Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . 6.812920690579612
Any other inconsistencies with modern <UNK> have been left as printed . 4.216965034285822
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . 5.179474679231212
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
This information , however , startled Mrs . 6.812920690579612
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to <UNK> , and was but slightly affected by his <UNK> of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the <UNK> altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh . 1.2809343786525484
" Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . 1.53174046370208
My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them . 3.8746751204561316
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 2.0535250264571463
They have some of the finest woods in the country . " Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <UNK> . 2.346228848142263
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 4.641588833612778
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 3.8746751204561316
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 3.8746751204561316
She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa . 3.593813663804627

We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . 2.0535250264571463
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 2.4244620170823286
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . 4.641588833612778
They will take care not to <UNK> their income . 5.179474679231212
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . 2.610157215682537
it must be my uncle ' s doings ! 5.878016072274914
" Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy . 3.1622776601683795
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 6.812920690579612
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 4.641588833612778
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 1.8047217668271702

No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . 2.7213387683753076
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 3.1622776601683795
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 1.3485595530525598
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
Pray , how violent was Mr . Bingley ' s love ? " " I never saw a more promising inclination . 2.4244620170823286
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . 2.9935772947204895
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " <UNK> so I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . 1.2742749857031337
my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned . 2.9935772947204895
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . 3.593813663804627
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 1.8329807108324359
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two . 3.1622776601683795
Gardiner . 46.415888336127786
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 1.6681005372000588
Bennet . 46.415888336127786
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . 2.4244620170823286
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> . 1.295267744355328
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of <UNK> was delightful to her , and she began her song . 1.5998587196060583
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 3.359818286283782
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry <UNK> , a very mean art . " " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is <UNK> in all the arts which ladies sometimes <UNK> to employ for <UNK> . 1.53174046370208
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . 5.878016072274914
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . 2.0092330025650473
His attachment to Rosings , certainly <UNK> . " Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 1.8047217668271702
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 3.359818286283782
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 2.7213387683753076
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished . 2.9935772947204895
It is Mr . Bingley I am sure . 5.878016072274914
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 1.2589254117941673
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 2.9935772947204895
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions . 1.7301957388458942
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 1.41011239906908
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 2.1017480113324885
These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 2.154434690031884
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish . 3.593813663804627
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . 4.641588833612778
" It must not be thought of . 6.812920690579612
Poor dear child ! 17.78279410038923
" I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham . 1.8957356524063758
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 1.7534865500829584
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . 2.346228848142263
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 2.0092330025650473
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and <UNK> every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the <UNK> of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 1.4977474763452014
" I am , dear Sir , c . 5.878016072274914
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . 3.359818286283782
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 2.154434690031884
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and <UNK> , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <UNK> her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . 1.3433993325989002
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening . 1.8957356524063758
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <UNK> of Mrs . 2.610157215682537
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 3.1622776601683795
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 1.2352165993694857
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . 4.216965034285822
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 3.1622776601683795
At present I will say nothing about it . " " You are quite right . 3.1622776601683795
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and <UNK> , and talk and laugh all the way home . 2.610157215682537
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . 3.1622776601683795
<UNK> and <UNK> I can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart . 2.2758459260747883
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <UNK> . 3.593813663804627
Good bye . 26.82695795279726
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his <UNK> when he speaks . 3.359818286283782
<UNK> back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
I am glad he <UNK> here on Tuesday . 5.878016072274914
F . 46.415888336127786
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 1.1683354854432926
Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . " " No , no . 2.9935772947204895
<UNK> of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where . 3.8746751204561316
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him . 1.2195704601594413
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . 4.641588833612778
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 2.0535250264571463
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
There can be no occasion for your going so soon . 4.641588833612778
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 1.6876124757881477
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 3.359818286283782
" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 1.3894954943731377
She will follow wherever Lydia leads . 8.11130830789687
CHAPTER XVIII . 26.82695795279726
Miss Bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . 3.593813663804627
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . 1.2352165993694857
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . " The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . 1.7534865500829584
Kitty and Lydia take his <UNK> much more to heart than I do . 3.593813663804627
and Mrs . 26.82695795279726
Hurst ' s gown " Here she was interrupted again . 4.641588833612778
Then pray speak aloud . 12.915496650148839
Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . 2.154434690031884
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 1.557068404753731
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 2.610157215682537
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . 1.53174046370208
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . 3.1622776601683795
She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 4.641588833612778
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . 3.8746751204561316
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . 2.346228848142263
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <UNK> of my son in law . 1.8047217668271702
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 5.179474679231212
Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 2.610157215682537
We dressed up <UNK> in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! 2.346228848142263
In , the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg tm and future generations . 2.2122162910704493
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 2.51188643150958
Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their <UNK> in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . 1.3485595530525598
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , <UNK> my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " " It is well . 1.632172128563275
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " With such kind of <UNK> of their parties and good <UNK> , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . 1.4773776525985112
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 1.7301957388458942
But with me , it is not so . 5.878016072274914
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook , complying with the rules is very easy . 2.610157215682537
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away . 2.51188643150958
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . 2.610157215682537
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " <UNK> in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . 1.4873521072935114
I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister . 3.1622776601683795
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 1.365007806546014
About the <UNK> , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . " Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings . 1.8632463119315603
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 1.7082763938087104
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 5.179474679231212
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . 2.610157215682537
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its <UNK> . 2.51188643150958
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 2.610157215682537
And to be kept back on such a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . " " Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? " " With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . " Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . 1.2096079377043663
And a special licence . 12.915496650148839
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 2.2758459260747883
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . 3.359818286283782
Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . 1.5848931924611136
Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 1.6681005372000588
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her <UNK> you . " Mrs . 1.5441135899948315
A younger son , you know , must be <UNK> to self denial and dependence . " " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either . 1.8047217668271702
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . 6.812920690579612
<UNK> it , Kitty ? " Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . 3.1622776601683795
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . 2.610157215682537
" I should never have said Mrs . 6.812920690579612
She saw herself the object of attention , to <UNK> and to <UNK> of them at present unknown . 2.7213387683753076
" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . 3.359818286283782
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . 1.6496480740980204
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 1.4873521072935114
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 3.593813663804627
It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . 3.1622776601683795
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . 2.346228848142263
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . 1.8329807108324359
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some <UNK> in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . 1.28792362543363
Hurst and Miss Bingley . 12.915496650148839
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . 3.359818286283782
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . 3.1622776601683795
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy . 5.878016072274914
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 1.8047217668271702
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . 1.4330125702369627
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 2.7213387683753076
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise . 1.2376350284724815
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! 3.1622776601683795
" Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever <UNK> , that your resentment once created was <UNK> . 1.4330125702369627
" And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . 2.51188643150958
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 1.3485595530525598
Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately . 5.878016072274914
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be <UNK> . 2.8480358684358014
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ' s <UNK> had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or <UNK> in him . 1.615598098439874
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . 2.2758459260747883
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 3.359818286283782
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 1.5848931924611136
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . 1.5199110829529336
Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . " In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . 1.5441135899948315
He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 1.5441135899948315
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 1.5441135899948315
Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . 1.632172128563275
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . 4.216965034285822
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . 2.2122162910704493
In that case he would return no more . 5.878016072274914
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . " Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . 1.5706464294715548
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! 4.641588833612778
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . 2.346228848142263
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 6.812920690579612
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 1.5998587196060583
Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in <UNK> . 2.0092330025650473
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged . 1.9684194472866121
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 2.0535250264571463
But Georgiana would not join her . 8.11130830789687
And his behaviour , so <UNK> altered , what could it mean ? 3.8746751204561316
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . 1.778279410038923
I have no such <UNK> to resent . 6.812920690579612
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . " " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . 1.3768571648527583
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . 3.359818286283782
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . 3.359818286283782
With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were <UNK> understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged . 1.3830728955554412
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 1.9684194472866121
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 2.7213387683753076
Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father . 1.632172128563275
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . 2.8480358684358014
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . 1.93069772888325
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be <UNK> into it ? " " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to <UNK> with rather more <UNK> the degree of importance which is to <UNK> to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . 1.1708281368909708
These are <UNK> , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . 2.0092330025650473
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 1.333521432163324
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 1.557068404753731
Oh , sister ! 17.78279410038923
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 3.359818286283782
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 1.4585940117250362
He was <UNK> for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have <UNK> it . 2.2122162910704493
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . 1.7534865500829584
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . 1.4677992676220695
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . 1.93069772888325
There can be no love in all this . 5.878016072274914
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 2.154434690031884
It will pass away soon enough . " " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty . 1.5706464294715548
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . 3.593813663804627
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . 1.4174741629268053
She is unfortunately of a sickly <UNK> , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who <UNK> her education , and who still <UNK> with them . 1.5706464294715548
Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very <UNK> said , " What is the matter mamma ? 2.2122162910704493

E . . . B . " Project Gutenberg " is a registered trademark . 1.3593563908785256
I always said it must be so , at last . 4.641588833612778
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . 1.9684194472866121
If the <UNK> of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . 1.8957356524063758
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 1.615598098439874
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . 1.5199110829529336
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 1.8329807108324359
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such <UNK> , and her intreaty that she would not give into it . 2.1017480113324885
No , no I feel he may defy us there . 4.641588833612778
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention . 2.154434690031884
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . 2.7213387683753076
Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ? 3.8746751204561316
I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . " " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . 1.4677992676220695
Pray do not talk of that odious man . 5.878016072274914
Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . 3.359818286283782
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 1.9684194472866121
She is gone down to her uncle at <UNK> ; gone to stay . 3.593813663804627
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . 1.8632463119315603
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 1.7301957388458942
Lord ! 46.415888336127786
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . 1.615598098439874
But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 1.6496480740980204
Mr . Collins received and returned these <UNK> with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <UNK> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 1.41011239906908
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however <UNK> its existence might prove , had at least <UNK> one day . 1.302994338575022
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 1.41011239906908
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 1.5706464294715548
They must all go to Brighton . 8.11130830789687
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 2.154434690031884
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 2.8480358684358014
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . 2.2122162910704493
Bennet . 46.415888336127786
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " cried Elizabeth . 1.9684194472866121
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 3.8746751204561316
His sense of her inferiority of its being a <UNK> of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . 1.5706464294715548
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 2.51188643150958
Their table was <UNK> stupid . 10.000000000000002
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 1.9684194472866121
" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any <UNK> , rather adds to your other perfections . 2.0535250264571463
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . 1.4677992676220695
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <UNK> ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had <UNK> , in his offer to herself . 1.557068404753731
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . 4.216965034285822
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . 1.4412195967188537
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 4.216965034285822
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! 5.878016072274914
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid . 1.7534865500829584
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 1.615598098439874
" If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . 1.615598098439874
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . 10.000000000000002
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 2.0535250264571463
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 3.359818286283782
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . 1.8957356524063758
" <UNK> Oh ! 17.78279410038923
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 1.6876124757881477
" How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . You think it a faithful <UNK> undoubtedly . " " I must not decide on my own performance . " He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . 1.365007806546014
" Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared . 3.593813663804627
What a good joke it will be ! 6.812920690579612
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . 3.1622776601683795
You supposed more than really existed . 8.11130830789687
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . 2.610157215682537
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . 1.9684194472866121
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . " " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . 1.2560585988318853
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . 3.1622776601683795
CHAPTER XI . 26.82695795279726
Hurst began again . 17.78279410038923
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more <UNK> purpose . 2.8480358684358014
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 2.9935772947204895
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> . 2.4244620170823286
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . 2.346228848142263
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 1.4330125702369627
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 1.2505106035854068
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 5.179474679231212
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . 3.1622776601683795
I am sick of them all . 8.11130830789687
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . 4.641588833612778
If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession . 1.8047217668271702
The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for <UNK> as may be <UNK> to himself and not offensive to his patron . 1.778279410038923
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . 4.641588833612778
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 2.0092330025650473
" I cannot make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by <UNK> for being next in the entail ? We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " No , my dear ; I think not . 1.4174741629268053
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . 2.51188643150958
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 2.2122162910704493
She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . 2.2758459260747883
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 1.3830728955554412
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 1.7082763938087104
With <UNK> tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of <UNK> that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . 1.7301957388458942
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . 2.2122162910704493
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . 3.8746751204561316
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 1.778279410038923
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 4.641588833612778
My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . 1.5199110829529336
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter . 1.778279410038923
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . 2.346228848142263
It is really too distressing . 10.000000000000002
<UNK> sons cannot marry where they like . " " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . " " Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . " " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl ' s younger son ? 1.228247006346923
" Good Heaven ! 17.78279410038923
<UNK> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all . 1.615598098439874
But in what <UNK> it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . 2.610157215682537
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 2.51188643150958
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 1.7534865500829584
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it . 1.4677992676220695
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 2.0092330025650473
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . 4.216965034285822
Mr . Darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . 2.7213387683753076
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it <UNK> , has surprised me a good deal . 1.8329807108324359
Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces . 2.51188643150958
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 4.216965034285822
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 2.7213387683753076
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room . 2.7213387683753076
" I am sure there is not on his . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . 2.7213387683753076
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . 2.610157215682537
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 2.0092330025650473
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 1.5441135899948315
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 1.2679227183627855
I shall like it of all things . 6.812920690579612
My fingers wait your orders . " " Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . " " Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1.4412195967188537
Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . 2.2122162910704493
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 1.8329807108324359
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 2.51188643150958
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 2.7213387683753076
But she is nothing to me now . 6.812920690579612
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate . 2.9935772947204895
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 1.9684194472866121
It became her turn to listen . 8.11130830789687
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . 2.9935772947204895
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 3.359818286283782
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
' Ah ! 26.82695795279726
Jane looked a little <UNK> than usual , but more <UNK> than Elizabeth had expected . 3.1622776601683795
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 2.154434690031884
Her mother <UNK> <UNK> , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 1.5848931924611136
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 1.8329807108324359
Bennet ' s <UNK> was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter . 2.7213387683753076
Have not you always hated him ? " How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! 2.0535250264571463
For , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken <UNK> , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the <UNK> reproof . 2.0535250264571463
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last <UNK> , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were <UNK> answered . 1.778279410038923
" Excuse my interference . It was kindly meant . " " <UNK> girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . 1.6876124757881477
They walked on , without knowing in what direction . 5.179474679231212
" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . 5.878016072274914
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 2.51188643150958
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . 1.632172128563275
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 2.0535250264571463
" I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . 1.7301957388458942
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . 1.53174046370208
I have by no means done . 8.11130830789687
" You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried . 4.216965034285822
But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he <UNK> that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 1.3287913432286882
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 1.319720393061375
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . 4.641588833612778
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 1.7082763938087104
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 2.0092330025650473
Four nieces of Mrs . 12.915496650148839
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 1.6681005372000588
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <UNK> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 1.9684194472866121
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . 1.5706464294715548
" Don ' t keep <UNK> so , Kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! 3.1622776601683795
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia . 1.93069772888325
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 1.396135390856794
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 4.641588833612778
Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the <UNK> ? 1.7301957388458942
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 4.641588833612778
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with . 1.3485595530525598
So much the better . 12.915496650148839
Gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . 1.778279410038923
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . 4.641588833612778
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 6.812920690579612
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 2.0535250264571463
" You quite <UNK> Mr . Darcy . 6.812920690579612
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 2.8480358684358014
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! 1.7301957388458942
She was going to the <UNK> ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of <UNK> , just fit to be killed . " Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . 1.4773776525985112
By you , I was properly humbled . 6.812920690579612
Forster , the delight of Mrs . 8.11130830789687
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 2.4244620170823286
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . 2.51188643150958
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in <UNK> <UNK> to be her husband , might then have <UNK> in its proper place . 2.0092330025650473
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 1.6876124757881477
How was that possible ? 12.915496650148839
He can be a <UNK> companion if he thinks it worth his while . 3.593813663804627
" Can you come to morrow ? " Yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 2.0535250264571463
Oh , brother , how kind you are ! 5.878016072274914
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 1.3768571648527583
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . " " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <UNK> which other people may observe . 1.3070104796093682
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up . 2.7213387683753076
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . 1.3485595530525598
Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 2.2758459260747883
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . 2.51188643150958
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 1.778279410038923
Darcy said nothing at all . 10.000000000000002
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . " Elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! 1.7082763938087104
She could not <UNK> him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . 2.4244620170823286
Elizabeth was delighted . 17.78279410038923
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . 2.610157215682537
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said . 1.8047217668271702
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 2.8480358684358014
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 2.51188643150958
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 2.346228848142263
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . 1.9684194472866121
Make haste , and come down this moment . " Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . 1.4585940117250362
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . 4.641588833612778
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 1.2809343786525484
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 1.3153690504363762
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 26.82695795279726
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . " " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request . 2.0092330025650473
Collins and myself sincerely <UNK> with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the <UNK> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 1.7301957388458942
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! 2.51188643150958
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 1.778279410038923
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . " The wedding took place ; the bride and <UNK> set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . 1.5085907086001784
" You may well warn me against such an evil . 4.641588833612778
" Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 1.778279410038923
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 1.396135390856794
Gardiner . 46.415888336127786
This cannot be ! 17.78279410038923
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . 1.8329807108324359
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 5.179474679231212
Mr . Darcy <UNK> you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . 2.7213387683753076
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . 1.5848931924611136
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 1.93069772888325
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 2.2122162910704493
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good <UNK> will <UNK> it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth <UNK> lest her mother should be exposing herself again . 1.5441135899948315
CHAPTER III . 26.82695795279726
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <UNK> , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . 1.41011239906908
Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . 5.179474679231212
" My dear <UNK> , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of <UNK> each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s t te t te between two women can never end without a quarrel . 1.4497406703726319
I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
I was given good <UNK> , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 3.1622776601683795
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 2.2122162910704493
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 3.593813663804627
" Of music ! 17.78279410038923
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . 1.5998587196060583
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . 4.641588833612778
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 1.3593563908785256
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 1.1937766417144364
And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined . 1.6681005372000588
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 1.8957356524063758
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
But Mrs . 26.82695795279726
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 1.5199110829529336
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 2.610157215682537
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater <UNK> than first <UNK> often boast ; and so <UNK> did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were <UNK> to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 1.2742749857031337
" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . 2.2758459260747883
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 2.346228848142263
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 1.7082763938087104
<UNK> felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . 1.5199110829529336
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 2.7213387683753076
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 2.1017480113324885
do any thing rather than marry without affection . 5.878016072274914
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 1.615598098439874
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . 1.557068404753731
can it be really so ! 10.000000000000002
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 2.154434690031884
no , no , this is not likely . 5.878016072274914
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? 1.7301957388458942
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 1.396135390856794
Her own thoughts were <UNK> her . 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of <UNK> to others . 2.2122162910704493
She had got rid of two of the <UNK> which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . 1.7301957388458942
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge . 1.8329807108324359
" From what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Bennet could hardly contain herself . 10.000000000000002
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so <UNK> to you . 1.4497406703726319
You thought me then <UNK> of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . 3.1622776601683795
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . 3.359818286283782
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 1.2809343786525484
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their <UNK> concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 2.2122162910704493
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . 1.615598098439874
You must learn some of my philosophy . 6.812920690579612
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 1.8957356524063758
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 1.5998587196060583
<UNK> or twice she could discern a <UNK> blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . 2.7213387683753076
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 1.319720393061375
What will Wickham say ? 12.915496650148839
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 1.4585940117250362
What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . 2.346228848142263
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . 3.359818286283782
" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? " Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . 1.7534865500829584
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 1.53174046370208
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 4.641588833612778
CHAPTER <UNK> . 26.82695795279726
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 2.51188643150958
Bennet thus began the <UNK> conversation . " Oh ! 5.179474679231212
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the <UNK> ere long . " " Upon my word , Sir , " cried Elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . 1.53174046370208
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . 1.53174046370208
that abominable Mr . Darcy ! My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to <UNK> it . 2.0535250264571463
Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn . 3.593813663804627
He had to be sure done much . 6.812920690579612
It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 1.5706464294715548
Their visits to Mrs . 12.915496650148839
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 1.396135390856794
Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . 1.3485595530525598
but there were two or three much <UNK> in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to <UNK> it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . 1.8047217668271702
Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
CHAPTER V . 26.82695795279726
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . 1.333521432163324
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 2.8480358684358014
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . 3.8746751204561316
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 5.878016072274914
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months . 1.4174741629268053
" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet ' s manor . 1.632172128563275
Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . 1.8957356524063758
Indeed he has no improper pride . 8.11130830789687
" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she . 3.1622776601683795
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 6.812920690579612
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . 2.1017480113324885
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 1.8329807108324359
who could have done less for her ? 6.812920690579612
I cannot understand it . 12.915496650148839
Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 2.7213387683753076
Lord ! 46.415888336127786
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 2.1017480113324885
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees . 1.8632463119315603
On both sides it was only assertion . 6.812920690579612
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " " But I was embarrassed . " " And so was I . " " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " " A man who had felt less , might . " " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 1.2451970847350329
good or bad ? " " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . 1.5998587196060583
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . 3.8746751204561316
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 1.2401035305418566
Are the <UNK> of Pemberley to be thus <UNK> ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . 2.154434690031884
His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 2.346228848142263
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
I had no notion but he would go a <UNK> , or something or other , and not <UNK> us with his company . 2.2758459260747883
" But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing . 2.51188643150958
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 4.641588833612778
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 1.632172128563275
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . 1.4030037231905736
You are not going to be <UNK> , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . 2.51188643150958
But I dare not hope it . 8.11130830789687
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 1.8632463119315603
" He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 1.8632463119315603
If there were but such another man for you ! " " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . 1.93069772888325
It was agreed to . 12.915496650148839
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present <UNK> of good will are highly <UNK> , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . 1.3111339374215643
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . 1.6496480740980204
Every body declared that he was the <UNK> young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always <UNK> the appearance of his goodness . 1.8632463119315603
I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . 3.593813663804627

I have not that pain . 10.000000000000002
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 1.53174046370208

And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 2.4244620170823286
Oh , Lizzy ! 17.78279410038923
Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 2.1017480113324885
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 1.2058708946926584
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can <UNK> a woman . " " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? 1.4330125702369627
Who could about such a <UNK> little <UNK> thing ? " Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <UNK> and fancied liberal ! 1.5848931924611136
" I am all astonishment . 10.000000000000002
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the <UNK> of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . 1.3433993325989002
It was all pride and <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 3.593813663804627
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . 1.9684194472866121
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 1.7301957388458942
In such an <UNK> my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I <UNK> upon his goodness . " " Oh ! 1.7082763938087104

Her report was highly favourable . 10.000000000000002

In the hall they parted . 10.000000000000002
I did for you . 12.915496650148839
Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 2.346228848142263
Lydia laughed , and said , " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . 2.8480358684358014
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 1.5706464294715548
They had long wished to see him . 6.812920690579612
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish . 1.1905772393787835
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . " " But not before they went to Brighton ? " " No , I believe not . " " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? 1.5199110829529336
That tall , proud man . " " Good gracious ! 4.641588833612778
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from <UNK> my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . 1.7301957388458942
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <UNK> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <UNK> , and paid off every <UNK> of civility to Elizabeth . 1.4497406703726319
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 2.154434690031884
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . " " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . 1.16957266874034
He takes them now for people of fashion . " The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she <UNK> a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his <UNK> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . 1.4174741629268053
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 1.3485595530525598
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 2.2122162910704493
where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without <UNK> a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . 1.4585940117250362
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . 2.610157215682537
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 1.4497406703726319
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 1.6681005372000588
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 1.5848931924611136
Long will do any such thing . 8.11130830789687
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 1.2401035305418566
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 4.641588833612778
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs . 1.4030037231905736
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . 1.8632463119315603

Now what have you to say ? " " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . " Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . 1.4677992676220695
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . " Her father lifted up his eyes . 2.51188643150958
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 1.8957356524063758
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 2.0535250264571463
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . 4.216965034285822
