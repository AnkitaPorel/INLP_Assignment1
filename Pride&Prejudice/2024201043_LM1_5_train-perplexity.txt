my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned . 1989.7013580682485
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 4656.6201551383065
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " " You may as well call it impertinence at once . 3629.786778260774
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 5749.993932488238
It seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary <UNK> , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . 4147.099579698943
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . " " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 3752.1312252406756
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . 4529.289656602322
Again she read on . 367.8042943620858
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 3229.2972704632853
He cannot know what Mr . Darcy is . " " <UNK> not ; but Mr . Darcy can please where he chuses . 2732.4809394610993
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . 912.9232291366192
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 4495.514154669492
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . 1340.6756843133835
I wonder who first discovered the <UNK> of poetry in driving away love ! " " I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy . 3443.839239522909
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . 1341.9605122402124
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> ! 1611.1354007923346
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . 3855.790149903032
And what sort of table do they keep ? 913.428181272564
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . 1476.934649306361
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . 2913.11713120905
He readily agreed to it . 495.5037716455499
They came . 158.51019343467547
Had it been your uncle ' s doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . 3152.235584125685
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 3745.759404549131
Such very superior dancing is not often seen . 912.8338573028615
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 1615.5864555411056
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing . 3230.556083730497
It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . 1991.5925943404434
CHAPTER IX . 158.33268212522805
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 2821.4712240027566
" She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . 1994.256233876186
He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . " " Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . " He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . 6081.893498277748
" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But now we may be silent . " " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " Sometimes . 4464.687410695553
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of <UNK> and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 3855.591243963766
She was overpowered by shame and vexation . 772.4786409168963

" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 4829.74589069407
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 4952.888807374757
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 4390.88608972699
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished <UNK> of integrity or benevolence , that might <UNK> him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the <UNK> of virtue , atone for those <UNK> errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . 4903.696353343434
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . 2220.8084007337293
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 4054.2286494017817
and to see dear Wickham too ! 629.3955369387002
Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . 4353.0210214446915
Every kind of pride must <UNK> from the connection . 1056.3878443545875
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Mr . Darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <UNK> throughout the whole . 4427.982020424792
Lady Catherine ' s great attentions to Mrs . 913.2613740746583
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral <UNK> from the evil before them . 2330.2034133591233
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my <UNK> from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . 2636.1214364199927
The discussion of Mr . Collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . 3858.6515408718183
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . " " I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a kingdom ! 4313.18364603181
Give me farther particulars . 367.81008746800734
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 2330.244726428938
" Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . 3806.242894194641
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . 1476.7255405197404
<UNK> inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in <UNK> ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the <UNK> Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . 4594.410031818231
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a <UNK> as this . 3230.623390771076
Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father . 4006.9162913333184
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to <UNK> him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <UNK> of your understanding , but <UNK> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <UNK> , and those which <UNK> the <UNK> ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the <UNK> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 6265.795389031652
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole <UNK> of <UNK> , as was here collected in one individual . 3227.469788889702
Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Mr . Collins began . 2109.3059888659136
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though <UNK> with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 4925.922472243437
When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs . 1199.5154134060017
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . 1202.2427613245643
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . 4746.244840180713
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 1477.5591486659403
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . 2537.709683322234
Mr . Bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is <UNK> with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . " She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . 5103.323556778677
Mr . Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . 2823.7554041129856
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 4567.04218332942
How is such a man to be worked on ? 1056.6013439601763
Make haste , make haste . 494.2163744472452
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature . 2221.460947044286
And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from <UNK> . 1477.5468229384087
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <UNK> on such a research ; in which <UNK> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally <UNK> , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . 5179.949317490413
Be so kind as to <UNK> for us to Miss Darcy . 1339.2139252847533
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . 1872.5343522986548
Mr . Darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . 1202.3785390865771
But my dear Lydia , I don ' t at all like your going such a way off . 2223.8499574161706
His doing so drew her notice . 629.863455607075
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . 914.5727872100804
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 5685.609459352346
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 2226.1765183415737
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word . 1741.4220445523379
From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 4948.984268721082
What will you think of my vanity ? 770.0628748823699
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only <UNK> off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . " When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . 4771.760414420132
I saw them the night before last . " Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . 3509.17503323649
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <UNK> , distance becomes no evil . 1989.0704456932592
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 1742.2381656715945
" My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . " They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . " " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence . " " You cannot be too much on your guard . 5995.785592242756
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a <UNK> ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 4463.577669452369
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . " " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose . 2823.5388205080794

When Mrs . 158.35803526048997

In Three Volumes . 254.57066874377242
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . 2537.392068230087
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely . 2997.8162230143544
What a good joke it will be ! 770.0992363346957
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 1201.4704141473044
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 2333.3995037970717
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected . 2640.381673524716
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more . 1342.304716778068
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in <UNK> affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? 3509.4760341902183
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . 3629.247971731118
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . 3439.0361798552203
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . 5685.039676202241
His sense of her inferiority of its being a <UNK> of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . 4189.248831450053
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . 2223.2396536863403
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! 1340.0525681210142
Bennet could hardly comprehend it . 495.2781448867766
But gracious me ! 255.31322292302104
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . 1743.4322712531502
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . 4746.056373506515
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! 1741.0077695031443
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 1991.166245666199
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the <UNK> of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . 5018.943045864737
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 5894.3987937450165
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . 2730.0394770172675
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! 1202.9728267180462
Collins . 84.04158031443681
it cannot be . 254.27457024059822
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . 3859.833967624904
If I wished to think <UNK> of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however . " " If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . " " Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . " " This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . 5017.925536207378
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . 1203.1431712772287
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . " Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire . 5516.785782209176
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? 4147.477461535963
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . " " Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . " " And do you like her ? " " Very much . " " I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . 4466.670743231201
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 1056.3986540691535
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , <UNK> over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in <UNK> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 4901.238574908142
" I am sure there is not on his . 1061.3021504478334
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! 912.7145312872361
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 4007.5420730573733
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 4798.701798962652
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 4852.205678844077
END OF THE <UNK> <UNK> . 494.2093638417893
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . 4597.030163309066

He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . 1200.987592298955
I cannot do justice to his kindness . 773.1745548598185
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self importance and humility . 5080.69992404868
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . 913.1218019318792
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two <UNK> with Jane again , and the two <UNK> with Lizzy , and the <UNK> " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! 4771.552205306594
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes <UNK> , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . 2731.1206588813698
" You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . 4150.356675317755
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do ! 1610.7425282863019
Lord ! 83.99404628310712
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . 2331.218887522507
" How strange this is ! 496.9260381594383
We have heard nothing from town . " " Dear madam , " cried Mrs . 1867.7845366861027
CHAPTER XI . 158.33268212522805
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from <UNK> my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . 3750.747356689048
Royalty payments must be paid within days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your <UNK> tax returns . 2820.428358023296
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . 3372.2983057126844
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged . 3374.7420892946516
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . 2335.291654236534
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . 1199.5266504001595
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . 2636.2730546468824
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 2435.807092259241
CHAPTER XIV . 158.33268212522805
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . 2330.134676842149
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . 3374.2372924101132
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 4626.84500341829
" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? " Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . 3693.476211905209
Is not general incivility the very <UNK> of love ? " " Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . 3152.3982688868455
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . 2335.429345907274
But I dare not hope it . 631.4753050090014
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s . 2540.9503761653455
what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . 4054.838761080136
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . 2539.9599290106735
You know my sentiments . " " You are then resolved to have him ? " " I have said no such thing . 2732.6523377678036

Kitty , run down and order the carriage . 912.7941140341296
Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? " " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . 3689.0376207080217
She is well , and <UNK> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . Your ' s , c . 2541.2571710842267

Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another . 3300.436017066565
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . 1741.1375830913903
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the <UNK> road . 4149.571330722267

She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <UNK> them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 4148.5968907169145
" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . 3509.363998600186
You know him too well to doubt the rest . 1057.5767974433954
" John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? " " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 3693.756949168603
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . 1872.783925055118
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs . 1990.9392715986485
Elizabeth immediately began playing again . 494.97457543605526
" The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . 2998.1230908468237
Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . " " To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart . 5539.710602874814
" You may well warn me against such an evil . 1203.420734154572
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . 3632.0689944806377
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . 3750.7474069163804
Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 2107.708247235101
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 1479.6844379717313
Mary <UNK> for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . 2729.7222689926166
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her <UNK> being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 4972.515093173499
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . " " <UNK> ! " cried Bingley . 2107.4652410065155
I speak <UNK> . 255.90763389052896
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . 912.7145312872361
Mr . Collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . 1614.4266137516393
never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F . 2330.120914185927
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . " " Good <UNK> ! " cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? How could his will be <UNK> ? Why did not you seek legal <UNK> ? " " There was just such an <UNK> in the terms of the <UNK> as to give me no hope from law . 5141.986841388383
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set <UNK> . 2335.5534753798474
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . 4497.688952347288
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . " " I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . " " Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . " " That is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . 5020.822604506022
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . 4312.138309233804
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . 1610.7932579391145
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 3507.7340777376417
She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa . 1614.1100304790275
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 4312.070553761358
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! 2330.258526852275
Thank Heaven ! 158.17300154466707
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so <UNK> that I cannot answer for being <UNK> . 4058.6698273558072
Not like the wild young men now a days , who think of nothing but themselves . 1989.3253480517258
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . 3960.045402701794
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . 1615.4211219469262
Yes , yes . 254.2790783719526
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . 3631.63177112203
so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! 912.7841876593673
<UNK> was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth " My dearest Lizzy , " I <UNK> myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . 4100.407258687756
Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . 4146.848771286979
I am so happy . 370.31560582597615
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W . 2635.3503273243623
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious . 5080.709234805425
" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . 2542.8307351538647
such an openness and gentleness in his manner . " " There certainly was some great <UNK> in the education of those two young men . 2907.942078145057
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs . 1477.6084211690861
If she does not object to it , why should we ? " " Her not objecting , does not justify him . 2636.1908803757096
She has two nieces of her own . 772.114977229968
Gardiner abused her stupidity . 368.1275897086349
Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . 3438.9834295562073
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 2823.659690983539
" Oh , Lizzy ! 370.10387419044116
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . 3302.1758848123422
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . 4054.622890655347
They soon <UNK> the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . 2222.5490628431726
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 3439.2722850183513
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ' s <UNK> had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or <UNK> in him . 4056.9623955234347

I always said it must be so , at last . 1203.0410308345668
Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a <UNK> over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was <UNK> Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <UNK> . 4688.229393054954
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . " " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . 4388.637065812883
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . 3153.9886178584134
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . 1611.1855554754543
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , <UNK> had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 4496.8693265752445
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done . 3230.0076155053384
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 2543.7581868117363
They have some of the finest woods in the country . " Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <UNK> . 2636.944086325336
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 2537.7511849953253
" Oh , Jane , take care . " " My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . " " I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . " They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs . 4776.926530912988
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . " Elizabeth could not <UNK> a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . 4925.958182097618
c . " Mr . Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . 3439.180704034765
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . 1199.5730391265545
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . 1867.5336431310377
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 5250.335365901382
" Are you not diverted ? " " Oh ! 1060.7252988841492
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 2441.1817777808483

The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . 3571.084491148854
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . " She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . 3751.364488415206
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his <UNK> to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm . 4009.760951477152
do not repeat what I then said . 769.7272299965581
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . " Mrs . 2226.0331516877704
Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant <UNK> to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " I do not know . I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult . 4461.895896309365

Hill began instantly to express her joy . 769.7181374234376
On Saturday he came again . 494.39818139823774
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <UNK> , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her <UNK> and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , Lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . 4717.199848113919
I know not what to think . 632.4468571438929
I believe I have now told you every thing . 1060.216693226575

CHAPTER V . 158.32627053238474
how I laughed ! 254.30608799408392
CHAPTER I . 158.33268212522805
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <UNK> for Mr . Darcy ' s pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham . 6220.347121127208
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at Longbourn . 2730.066891222957
She had also to <UNK> how her visit would pass , the quiet <UNK> of their usual employments , the vexatious <UNK> of Mr . Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings . 3633.443559109057
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . 2438.920156530243
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . 3505.048342658845
Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . " " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK> accordingly . " " You did ! 5060.945090997663
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as <UNK> <UNK> as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . 4188.64725618358
I would keep a pack of <UNK> , and drink a bottle of wine every day . " " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . 3573.0842103663085
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> . 769.7998727328018
Do not distress me by the idea . 769.8544484293403
I shall like it of all things . 773.2109767117785
END OF VOL . 254.27006984879984
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been <UNK> from the world , in some distant farm house . 3958.329772097282
" Mrs . 159.37463699693726
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 4008.4167560471565
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . " " This is not to be borne . 2539.275194899203
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <UNK> <UNK> necessary . 3568.226219055398
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 1741.8494029706064
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <UNK> <UNK> . 3301.4878430217223
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she <UNK> in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . 4315.653036768293
He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . 1613.1103271928262
Let her go then . 367.9084587605565
it must be my uncle ' s doings ! 912.7841820190165
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? 4562.67441576402
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! 3747.6009482371164
The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . 2110.0789758862343
CHAPTER III . 158.33268212522805
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . 3570.8509995488334
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . 1199.0082426759393
It is impossible that he should still love me . " After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on <UNK> their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water <UNK> , there <UNK> to be a little alteration . 4688.365061276173
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . 1994.2907332143866
It was to be such a secret ! " " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject . 3231.2172329493224
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . 1742.438223567336
" Do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; " that is rather singular . " " Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " <UNK> cards . 3444.359482630267
She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . 3806.2199080288715
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . 3630.6254864521184
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 1995.3186887962906
I shall never forget her appearance this morning . 916.576975202808
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . " And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr . Collins thus addressed her , " When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from <UNK> you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . " " <UNK> , Mr . Collins , " cried Elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly . 5915.861339636684
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . 1342.3403923877702
In the hall they parted . 494.7467888118852
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? " A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and <UNK> and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . 5142.3923182338085
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 1340.603802903583
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 3570.2673814147606
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 4314.3038286637575
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <UNK> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . 2820.8824376541083
In <UNK> lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <UNK> in this interference . 3153.165776662281
Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated . 4388.813023267115
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a <UNK> kind of a little <UNK> on one side of your lawn . 4688.147378810399
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be <UNK> to her nieces . 2993.02977468657
I want to talk very seriously . 632.3002650724726
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . 3688.8591132119914
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . 914.662481509825
came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the <UNK> , and at the <UNK> in Barnet and <UNK> , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . 3688.362542404007
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her <UNK> of Mrs . 1479.501786043522
" Your ' s , c . " This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be <UNK> , by the sister at least . 3634.2381703818683
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . 3076.9669192259507
are quite well . " " But you How are you ? " cried Elizabeth . 1867.7851434143513
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . 2438.8648410861388
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 3692.2171992161934
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 2636.328150152479
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone . 3856.476243823249
" You look pale . 370.14451163230916
And who knows what may happen ? 629.8554949230543
" Lizzy , you must not do so . 916.551550014964
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . 3630.028516387559
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . 4274.4104967441035
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . 1477.6940632756632
She <UNK> from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . 4057.6326045910087
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . 2908.586975573635
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . 2730.3286448600775
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . 3301.354872302726
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation . 3153.5516443873403
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 3861.117410877103
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . 4686.549106658912
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . 2820.7038419037385
We had better not mention it . 629.6380905879264
Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the <UNK> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . 4388.647829887809
That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <UNK> in town , as Mr . Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . 4825.330860395575
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . 1201.4158452553054
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . 3074.0155426120323
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . 1741.1635543565249
It must be an amusing study . " " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing . 2223.4886639815622
Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? 3152.289613132338
It was a fortnight since Mrs . 631.4293035304473
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 1615.5228919776596
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . 1339.2257986381114
No one but Mrs . 367.93162272424433
There can be no love in all this . 913.2405040869163
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 1740.9818005913999
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were <UNK> of dejection . 3855.6412173464773
Mr . Darcy replied with great <UNK> , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley . 2733.2364425447454
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 1741.8876370506748
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . 1868.006840694
It will save me a world of trouble and economy . 1200.865066941426

Mrs . 84.28665600062531
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . " " Aye that is because you have the right disposition . 2993.924641042472
She continued in very <UNK> reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 3691.949999125468
Let us hope for better things . 629.468437567127
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . 2823.6762003864405
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . 3910.530460979614
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over <UNK> , as I always am . 2825.5242234843095
He was my <UNK> , and excessively attached to me . 1201.2138631054418

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <UNK> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . 4656.93734584504
Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical . 913.4376366189142
<UNK> laws in most <UNK> are in a constant state of change . 1476.6147084187562
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1741.8351151122392
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 2333.8140691062517
At present we have nothing to guide us . 913.1217177370022
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few <UNK> , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <UNK> . " Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 5080.700542149249
how rich and how great you will be ! 912.8040433434604
Elizabeth longed to <UNK> its <UNK> ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . 2821.933451753048
I do think Mrs . 370.0488306755381
" My dear , dear Lydia ! " she cried " This is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing . 4465.047340349985
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . 5123.440853556754
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 3804.607148269946
how I wanted you ! " " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . " " Certainly . 3802.4556296491432
" You quite <UNK> Mr . Darcy . 773.4886419426412
They <UNK> it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . 2636.7918485615305
How is half such a sum to be repaid ? " Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . 3568.5892354741095
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate . 3910.594068977101
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 4103.162567409239
One day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . 3152.1005178636
I thank you for explaining it so fully . 916.4172927350897
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever . 3370.902369148183
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . " " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . 4105.181986079807
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . 1060.3774973572802
They would doubtless be <UNK> with the generality of female minds . 1340.462206976546
" A man who has once been refused ! 916.5015861264039
I wonder what he can be doing there . " " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth . 2826.3240732326944
CHAPTER II . 158.33268212522805
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . 1741.7707328930774
Reynolds was of no trifling nature . 629.3631381250374
He still loves me , and we are engaged . " Jane looked at her <UNK> . 1991.6033121110459
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 4530.685620702183
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 1060.3716464162346
It is useless to talk of it . " It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . 3155.142725213381
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . 2995.54180545519
She certainly did not hate him . 631.4037889968785
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 4145.596525554791
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 5061.688230452337
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected . 1200.6229123515825
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it . 2824.1834714482156
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due . " " My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . 5267.760199609301
Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . 4995.376930475765
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s t te t te with Mrs . 2911.4101416613466
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us . 1479.4810555568247
CHAPTER VII . 158.32627053238474
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . 1056.2917858658675
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . 2220.944670232978
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 2107.5748825469705
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled . 2908.490761814019
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . 4625.971852426374
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent . 3857.332239698442
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . Bingley was <UNK> to Darcy by the easiness , openness , <UNK> of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . 4594.378703021456
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . 1992.6074402569698
Her mother ' s <UNK> , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . 4496.288395731018
What is your own opinion ? " " That it ought not to be attempted . 1867.6920990182937
Pemberley was now Georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . 2635.294984185673
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . 1872.031006534454
CHAPTER VI . 158.32627053238474
She then <UNK> again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . " " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . " " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something <UNK> <UNK> in the usual <UNK> of such a meeting . 6189.962586405371
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . " " Are you quite sure , Ma ' am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said Jane . " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . " " Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . " " Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . 5598.717805978737
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 2734.9964909090663
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . 1742.949388469653
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . 1199.076049005859
She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <UNK> him with fears and regrets in <UNK> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 5285.910233329136
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 2334.227353217789
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . 3569.344551874962
Mr . and Mrs . 369.3319016231363
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . 4102.644303186395
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough . 494.20236326659005
You refuse to <UNK> the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . 1612.164882792584
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . 1994.0888603968162
Of course , we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg tm name associated with the work . 4231.269440743218
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up . 2221.3136224749287
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . 4353.211904361023
what could she mean by it ? 629.3550358149696
They contained no actual <UNK> , nor was there any <UNK> of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 2538.764188053247
But will they make you happy ? " " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " <UNK> at all . 3442.805398118354
I thought we never should have got into the coach . 1203.0410050681753
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile it was decided . 2820.882616780016
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . 1611.652703837833
In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <UNK> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 5060.706891016196
" There is nothing the matter with me . 916.5715272710459
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia ' s leaving home . 3077.0280482500425
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added <UNK> to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be <UNK> . 4314.100735271912
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 3570.851017939178
The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for <UNK> as may be <UNK> to himself and not offensive to his patron . 3632.043229753631
They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins ' s admiration . 1613.0664099706605
You need not . 254.7755480443156
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . " " To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . " " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . " " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . 5621.423965586037
Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . 1992.687083499099
What will become of me . 494.46798318786324
" I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth . 1482.3929729947215
" Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . " He should be particularly happy at any time , c . 3306.9721242382416
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 1199.008162563312
" I cannot see why Mrs . 632.9694672348722
My fingers wait your orders . " " Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . " " Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . 4627.030506946757
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners <UNK> respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 4312.386091111108
My dear Charles , what do you mean ? " " Yes , all of them , I think . 2331.8370786791934
" What can be the meaning of this ! " said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone . 2335.9594007424425
She would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house . " Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer . 3859.185434782595
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all <UNK> , if she <UNK> more , and could have the advantage of a London master . 3958.269183258837
and Mrs . 158.19859879229256
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph . 1991.6672194371954
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . 1616.2957530295794
Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a <UNK> season , made her feel that the <UNK> , <UNK> , most thread bare <UNK> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <UNK> . 5234.513001205597
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had <UNK> time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 4627.025042419188
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <UNK> <UNK> her there . 1992.1886137611373
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . 3075.6790480075642
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . 5744.213308495306
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother ' s schemes . 4190.383486358197
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . 2109.6068228932963
I have not been in the habit of <UNK> disappointment . " " That will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . " " I will not be interrupted . 4013.3569106039863
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . 1744.440126210164
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 2538.605820181657
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 4745.975910694787
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . 4425.9204763546295
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? " " Nearly three weeks . " " And you saw him frequently ? " " Yes , almost every day . " " His manners are very different from his cousin ' s . " " Yes , very different . 4773.2008314285595
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs . 769.8634358593487
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did . 1198.9177206913103
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . " " I see no occasion for that . 3693.0245227813602
He was <UNK> for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have <UNK> it . 2823.40033053742
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be <UNK> from it . 3153.726771691372
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and <UNK> , and talk and laugh all the way home . 2330.5196160593323
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to <UNK> her confidence in it . 3440.290006610547
I think I have heard you say that you know them . " " I know them a little . 2336.8135882601664
They agree with me in <UNK> that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the <UNK> of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself <UNK> says , will connect themselves with such a family . 4007.897350535593
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 2107.2492706409485
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an <UNK> on every subject . 1614.0337799053968
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 2112.187731202081
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have <UNK> domestic felicity in so <UNK> a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . 5253.208780098476
I expected you to stay two months . 773.0650477796262
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . 4462.903903234501
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their <UNK> concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 2821.429841995961
what news ? 158.18260200732448
His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . 3439.7037783044725
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . 2540.5100962940546
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <UNK> . 1741.3576086156634
Elizabeth hoped she had <UNK> him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 2822.0989445498335
Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . 2333.249786861125
These recollections will not do at all . 769.7454038698473
" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . 3376.7660878274537
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday . 5040.435103198395
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . 4230.796798422963
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . 1198.849809697293
who attended to you ? 367.82746240744393
You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <UNK> is denied me , because you have always so much . " Mr . Bingley arrived . 3372.761606282156
" I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 4236.1444030820685
" Then , who taught you ? 632.3852973989135
Hurst and Miss Bingley . 368.047465963435
Poor Jane ! 158.17940148526515
" I found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr . Darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . " She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . 5666.208414644779
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 2436.590838184721
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . 1870.240006200064
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . " " Oh ! " said Lydia <UNK> , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , I ' <UNK> the <UNK> . " The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . 5251.1121771007965
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . 1990.0865665253648
Miss Bennet had <UNK> ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . 2537.888929107152
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 1868.8470209516724
If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 3568.664608402189
Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 1058.7994468840898
You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in <UNK> those kind of schemes , and <UNK> a person of their <UNK> contempt . 4055.4869580149993
If gratitude and esteem are good <UNK> of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 2636.080156031865
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <UNK> manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . 3301.354166276046
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . 4009.6613593031716
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . 2108.419466842622
By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <UNK> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 3688.5537646700764
Your idea of the ponies is delightful . 769.9269091903756
Good gracious ! 158.17299927526295
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . 2332.716962533665
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 2541.491816313056
Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 3228.314728366283

In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 3630.2085198795553
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . 1476.713226982813
<UNK> as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> . 4144.975220180632
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . " It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . 4189.077319633837
" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not <UNK> declare that Caroline neither <UNK> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <UNK> the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly ! to put me on my guard ? 4690.002891288157
" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be <UNK> , for <UNK> I must call it . " " It is wonderful , " replied Wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 5124.68788854119
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> . 3155.3816917010063
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . 3961.3707563390367
Such a countenance , such manners ! 629.4360716718735
Gardiner was so little to be trusted . " " You must not blame my aunt . 1990.4763378452117
" With my mother up stairs . 632.3689989137639
There is one point , on which I want your advice . 1339.9950737861648
We were married , you know , at St . <UNK> ' s , because Wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish . 2730.232147336819
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . 3370.7962374248737
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . 3912.073577599182
Is nothing due to me on that score ? 912.7941027596953
Perhaps he thought her too young . 629.3631461648048
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 2113.3460055292758
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should <UNK> . 1476.8608340587882
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 2638.939003459914
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <UNK> recommendation , and to assert that I had <UNK> all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . 4388.336962251763
People do not die of little trifling <UNK> . 912.7045747650805
" Oh , yes ! if one could but go to Brighton ! 1481.754531944721
Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn . 1611.7038388358542
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side . 1341.9486230686734
But I have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous <UNK> , boy in the world . " Elizabeth almost stared at her . " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she . 4628.678912424448
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . " " That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever heard you utter . 4904.398530031638
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 4626.973018378783
Yet he is such a man ! " " Yes , yes , they must marry . 1989.6337022955267
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now . 1610.8947058692643
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . 1740.9688116794416
What did Colonel Forster say ? 494.4539658674431
. F . . F . . Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees <UNK> considerable effort to <UNK> , do copyright research on , <UNK> and <UNK> public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg tm collection . 3688.8977870355175
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . 2538.0267462369798
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr . Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent . 4055.8871712102664
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . " She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . 3908.137047671887
It was a rational scheme to be sure ! 915.3291048896331
Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and <UNK> her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family . 3748.002418801066
They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . 1612.1277941746182
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason . 4188.903168185658
Bennet was <UNK> the fire . 495.35520814691574
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . 2729.7085218957345
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 2908.1618991934997
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 4056.1335504639605
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 3855.492577096258
yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . 2330.217225237045
Not that I care about it , though . 912.9233768911914
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the <UNK> . 4594.934068023607
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 4054.3723238224793
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions . 3749.052100060792
Bennet , was not so well pleased with it . 1058.296699551672
She will follow wherever Lydia leads . 631.4363297140565
" He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . 4881.351726731095
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . 2635.8058555644293
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! 2537.9446981443484
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . 5101.2137948393465
" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? " said she . 1481.5446568605887
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 2223.102674126457
You must not suspect me . 495.10035634844076
I can recal nothing worse . 496.810327076634

I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . 1872.3884214518885
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 3572.726719639156
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . 3855.5170597316605
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can <UNK> a woman . " " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? 4657.616687119928
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . 1203.0296457656946
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies . 1611.564936884315
His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry <UNK> , his wife may teach him . 3301.31380828317
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 1058.6822089966674
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! 1743.265842681788
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . 4055.016185526234
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <UNK> , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . 3373.4188937636136
Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and <UNK> . 1989.4057996598838
But now it comes out . " " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows . 2110.4432223396266
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 1056.259706760734
Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 3154.2999012802798

Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . 2823.7140355123543
She has known him only a fortnight . 772.114977229968
But do not be cast down . 631.2561896554089
They saw him often , and to his other <UNK> was now added that of general <UNK> . 2108.3245691514585
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s <UNK> . 2636.0134280009697
Mr . Darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . 2224.9597516504396
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! 2107.73486081452
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey . 1992.3768757826208
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . 2908.079440277544
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . " <UNK> as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat <UNK> , she had all the success she expected . 5160.387436468118
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . 2825.620914081621
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 5082.817580936132
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . " Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right . 3507.673421187302
" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance . 3232.691358728404
But however he did not . 495.85179950945707
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <UNK> , but Mrs . 1989.51250870434
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 3227.4563481413275
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . 3958.0136728504135
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <UNK> and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " Wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of accents , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right . 5887.863785854686
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! 3228.3565904287125
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <UNK> <UNK> better than <UNK> ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 5818.544720290182
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . 4315.898101088135
In Lydia ' s imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of <UNK> happiness . 1989.9659221036432
Poor Charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . 4006.8559865883026
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 629.355059943074
The dejection was almost universal . 495.80396209481205
I was given good <UNK> , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 1872.1501381482362
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 4272.131943633763
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . " They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . 5179.936804692924
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . " Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . 5576.058720613451
All Meryton seemed striving to <UNK> the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . 2729.805099576559
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s <UNK> her coming so far alone . 3373.773989251189
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . 2996.034211306552
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 1201.404491649613
but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley ' s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the <UNK> have no horses to theirs . " " I had much rather go in the coach . " " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure . 4462.946141466304
You give me fresh life and <UNK> . 770.7196984477965
Elizabeth immediately <UNK> the livery , guessed what it meant , and <UNK> no small degree of surprise to her relations , by <UNK> them with the honour which she expected . 3372.099109613289
Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 2222.3026413593193
Not these two or three years perhaps . " " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can . 2992.4987993734244
My youngest sister has left all her friends has <UNK> ; has thrown herself into the power of of Mr . Wickham . 2636.287460604209
" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . 3233.76495900764
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . 1611.6390921373452
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 913.3888661281395
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 2637.890784494671
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 3302.9168871939687
They will never be distressed for money . 770.7295091260444
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! 1611.6266443255004
What a contrast between him and his friend ! 913.1515730635592
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen . 1741.500005293444
Reynolds could interest her on no other point . 912.7841608766901
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man . 3569.2923726604845
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them . 1615.4084002423867
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 2540.9664977877146
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . 3078.749220195103
It was unpardonable . 255.39594237098612
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . " Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . 3748.8019839260137
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . 3439.03612203408
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments . 2732.9726535266277
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 1610.767896507788
Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 2908.312720276689
Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley . 1870.3849390311418
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his <UNK> powers had gained him in the <UNK> . 4148.1867900653715
that abominable Mr . Darcy ! My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to <UNK> it . 3073.7440597599207
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . 1990.1002507432852
They entered it in one of its <UNK> points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , <UNK> over a wide extent . 2909.387352709276
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . " " And I certainly never shall give it . 2913.8450305112347
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . 1343.7984214274877
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I cannot blame myself for having done thus much . 3439.2327094992083
CHAPTER XII . 158.33268212522805
I am not equal to it . 632.8605293953376
Are you going much farther ? " " No , I should have turned in a moment . " And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together . 3439.2862875178107
Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend . 2636.855413213159
Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described . 1613.2215370014892
Lady Catherine de Bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . 2436.427834750416
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? 1339.3799549970208
" How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! " cried Lydia . 1343.7745128308682
A person may be proud without being vain . 913.0323189917887
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <UNK> of a bad day . 2908.4907732784723
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . " " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley . 3803.9219345800025
" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . 2997.6995159005014
" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 3079.027933243614
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one <UNK> of perfect <UNK> in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his <UNK> that her manners were not those of the <UNK> world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . 4562.156158746345
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . 2732.8508237029814
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily <UNK> seeing him , till after the departure of the former . 3570.2835258667915
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 3958.486221787657
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed . 3629.235126683313
There is nothing he would not do for her . " The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . 3439.719020248502
I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . 2225.7317552670806
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . 2110.5269594178335
I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the <UNK> . 2225.635743721204
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . 3634.795877959559
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . 2108.5823904997496
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which were scattered over the <UNK> lawn . 3688.413558596205
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . 3442.252408300167
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 2908.9553193774354
From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . 1056.3986147503836
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 3439.5209116376127
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 3373.2861456432315
GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 3370.8625966196987

But enough of this . 369.1685175956851
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so <UNK> . 2910.5198958836477
I wish I could see her . 632.3572915506129
' Tis as good as a Lord ! 769.7181374234376
Bennet , " to walk to <UNK> Mount this morning . 1200.9961281778974
But you do not know all . 631.2480560636409
One must speak a little , you know . 912.843839169868
Bennet <UNK> the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . 1612.613313634621
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give <UNK> confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr . Darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr . Darcy in a most infamous manner . 4851.980160445851
<UNK> , wretched , mistake ! " Darcy made no answer . 1339.273217433719
CHAPTER XI . 158.33268212522805
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . 2112.2421681536143
Mr . Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . 1992.5660818018387
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 3073.961779948281
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . 4351.741656239997
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 3228.007450831769
But slyness seems the fashion . 495.8447706869193
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . " This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . 4745.139281138139
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . 1342.0533197372924
" My aunt , " she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor street . " She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley . 4276.4398227828415
His belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 4007.8306504426964
It will pass away soon enough . " " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty . 4191.054588345692
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot . 629.7193091296443
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . 4190.553972213031
My father bears it better . 494.6840278231052
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 3804.6322203926566
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other . 2108.4196754237073
It will not do . 368.8643771074651
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . 2909.0645490654483
" Where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door . 1994.26969548271
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . 2440.8576143200107
" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . 2825.751226643792
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs . 1199.3578655494935
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . " " For heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr . Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . " Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . 5042.48467947771
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 2436.699939306992
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be <UNK> to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a <UNK> nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . 4827.307916211937
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . 3963.0208484804057
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means <UNK> or <UNK> , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . 4352.454866243175
But pride where there is a real <UNK> of mind , pride will be always under good <UNK> . " Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . 3076.6601441845346
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 3858.2790806570415
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane " I hope and trust they will yet be happy . 3958.4638487582415
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham . 916.5171348110015
<UNK> check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and addresses . 1610.61566620057
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
At five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . 2635.81948896743
The <UNK> of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . 2996.1300731257825
Could there be finer symptoms ? 494.244377157183
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . 2635.654568771435
What shall we do with him ? 629.5976525781532
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation . 4688.72779753261
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . 1477.731002549527
He was received by Mrs . 495.7210997434259
so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to every body . That is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . " " Did Charlotte dine with you ? " " No , she would go home . 4656.681950146472
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 3746.9590276138842
On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and told her with great <UNK> that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . 4656.630021577144
Where does discretion end , and <UNK> begin ? 912.6946211730334
No , no , let me <UNK> for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret . 4230.981073690991
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such <UNK> as these . 2437.355511734951
Besides , it will not much signify what one <UNK> this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . " " Are they indeed ? " cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . 4006.952611412193
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . 3371.1013836172738
Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . 3507.79907221258
Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time . 1478.3287016563138
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . 2637.0398810691167
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! 2330.258519052643
Every body declared that he was the <UNK> young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always <UNK> the appearance of his goodness . 3439.088654970075
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 1199.6276041562987
But we are all liable to error . 771.8766011060923
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking . 2997.830370321872
" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 3305.8770961943846

CHAPTER XIV . 158.33268212522805
I can hardly write for laughing . 632.3246987544501
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . 1870.3037312684971
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 3629.286512622766
But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . 1870.2374650714094
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried . 1482.3064933689575
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 3630.793313018516
Their first subject was the <UNK> of the Rosings party . " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . 3907.7710393251978
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 4188.577320783844
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . 1990.1801896522127
Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 4771.721335355525
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . 4972.2744710737425
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . 3305.764178492888
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 1477.1677373859518
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle . 1994.619395588047
Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . 2223.195229915168
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would <UNK> his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . 4973.965445246764
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . " " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . 4145.60940772241
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . 4715.664306952593
They are my old friends . 495.02376489154864
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 4188.717161456498
They may be <UNK> and printed and given away you may do <UNK> <UNK> with public domain eBooks . 2221.9744044674076
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out . She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . 5267.278384768062
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . 3569.353346900571
Brighton , and a whole <UNK> of <UNK> , to us , who have been <UNK> already by one poor regiment of militia , and the <UNK> balls of Meryton . " " Now I have got some news for you , " said Lydia , as they sat down to table . 4424.82331451781
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a <UNK> . 4972.83781764356
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 2541.588045065056
" But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with <UNK> , and rob it of a few <UNK> <UNK> without his perceiving me . " The period of expectation was now <UNK> . 3807.519711720145
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 3371.56370630894
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 2912.109963313495
The housekeeper came ; a respectable looking , <UNK> woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . 3076.717302294571
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most . 1992.5648929479096
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . 1994.987261386267
" Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . 4316.25822502653
In such an <UNK> my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I <UNK> upon his goodness . " " Oh ! 3802.917214569384
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for <UNK> Lodge , the <UNK> are dreadful . " Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . 3805.973945789624
Of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was <UNK> with admiration was evident enough . 2820.5110483295052
" <UNK> it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . " " Gracechurch street , Monday , <UNK> . 3232.516144400114
It was at Sir William Lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . 1870.5195870473744
To Mrs . 158.27524856690013
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 1200.2568944202155
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . 2437.8299155249606
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw <UNK> in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . 4771.6715250643565
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . 4929.465603565861
Forster and me are such friends ! and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? 3957.842885639202
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . 1339.758691284871
" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . " Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . 4354.642932773368
In the dining room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before . 3228.6497072471507
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 1992.1912298021132
He bore it however with admirable calmness . 771.4251074258603
<UNK> as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . 2992.252735832977
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of <UNK> in that way . 1992.1148319809306
But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! 771.9221499180255
But I must tell you how it went off . 1059.129693122398
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . 2729.8741710128384
I know your disposition , Lizzy . 632.3898121955606
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . <UNK> immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . " " What is his name ? " " Bingley . " " Is he married or single ? " " Oh ! 5476.84596846413
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . " " What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? 3688.961024744896
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . 2820.676414765702
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 2333.8011211183475
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . 4497.507987853026
Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 2332.3706957235036
On finding Mrs . 254.3779842398572
And when you have given your ball , " she added , " I shall insist on their giving one also . 2539.0476448820496
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the <UNK> , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 4851.08065448756
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . 1870.1472471039242
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B . 1198.8384755252605
Bennet with civil self command to Miss Lucas . 914.2225208985762
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 4744.461654855467
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . 1992.5286307484798
Every thing <UNK> what is strong already . 769.8543506502795
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 4496.729981091204
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? 2220.7263561186187
If the <UNK> of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . 3371.6025439649857
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 4311.74284266754
I shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will <UNK> and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " Elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 5828.834727746165
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 4313.658129732633
There is no indignity so <UNK> to their feelings ! " She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " " And quite alone ? 4687.650152935683
And his behaviour , so <UNK> altered , what could it mean ? 1477.4975402671998
<UNK> sons cannot marry where they like . " " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . " " Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . " " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl ' s younger son ? 5563.653267436253
But at length , by Elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that <UNK> which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the <UNK> . 5516.771318752929
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . 4272.689169324966
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 3304.038185742189
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . 1477.6694149165633
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . 3439.1932346567455
Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . " " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . " " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " I honour your circumspection . 5267.983103381812
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of <UNK> them . 3855.4926209521186
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . 2641.149668650562
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 3801.8813667065388
" Wickham so very bad ! 496.85565700790477
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . 4055.2552052218734
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 4233.683191276393
They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . " " <UNK> a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . 4995.646260581533
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 2997.44702430444
We have not met since the th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . " Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when <UNK> to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn . 4529.673672717798
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? 1339.261384010057
The extravagance and general <UNK> which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 3691.5933434471344
By you , I was properly humbled . 769.8180908072532
But though every thing seemed <UNK> and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <UNK> ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . 4057.0439360921705
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 5333.862554382049
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . 1744.8966322998892
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! 3152.3168077755913
Let me hear from you very soon . 769.9634209860219
But with me , it is not so . 915.0968082613425
The time fixed for the beginning of their <UNK> tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . 3303.4349534464923
Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very <UNK> said , " What is the matter mamma ? 2821.9886312268704
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Let me do it without farther loss of time . 1056.5482115639581
And pray what sort of <UNK> do you make ? 1056.9409648137157
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 1056.281095248568
He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would <UNK> more birds on the first of <UNK> , than any body else in the country . 3373.538355925517
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 3958.8172720517277
But I confess they would have no charms for me . 1201.8216489622528
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother How is she ? 3155.1271957151926
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . 5409.632531018295
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? " " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . " " Oh ! 4189.612377989897
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 771.9959719003128
CHAPTER XII . 158.33268212522805
She saw herself the object of attention , to <UNK> and to <UNK> of them at present unknown . 2224.0985745224225
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas . 4101.405797564643
" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech . 2443.0727123823463
We dressed up <UNK> in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! 2635.8054203358633
Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . 770.3073634078415
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much . 4426.6445821802445
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " Oh ! " cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted . 3630.314405576693
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 3153.49749814696
What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! 913.1416160083676
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . 1870.098462201252
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this <UNK> recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy ! 4689.118965966609
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 158.16979894891088
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , c . 3909.958111985346
<UNK> at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . 4594.294703286941
. <UNK> . The copyright laws of the place where you are located also <UNK> what you can do with this work . 2635.419284568875
They agreed that Mrs . 368.4372022611735
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <UNK> . 1867.7051107550449
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . 2108.5001269853947
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . 2106.991546033651
I know it to be impossible . " " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! 1872.415628925212
They were to be off as soon as possible . 1057.7058530602287
At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! 4351.0771020637585
Allowing for the common <UNK> of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy . 4495.74119627206
I depend on you for that . " To these high <UNK> expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the <UNK> of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . 5319.74594632179
" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . 1746.2071536418716
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 2911.5607754167
It <UNK> because of the efforts of <UNK> of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life . 2332.4717679192745
Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . " Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . 3505.8175701043638
<UNK> to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax <UNK> to the full extent permitted by U . S . federal laws and your state ' s laws . 3227.953882220695
Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . " After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! 4715.452230313996
Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . 5040.270637779849
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . " " You may depend upon it , Madam , " said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , " that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . " Mrs . 4352.4975759923655
" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . 916.551550014964
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . 2911.411375999233
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . 1611.2742781013937
You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! 1478.9432810051708
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . 1614.1582194960577
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not <UNK> their own , so much the better . 2537.82049840351
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 1342.1618184090012
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . 3227.5774580194034
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease . 3152.0328835774394
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . " Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . 4103.492576055801
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . 5284.010722004745
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him . 2729.6946143644886
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . 4529.39655287768
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . 3569.318429647466
" Of music ! 255.96856223631576
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 2110.4453698550187
She had no fear of its <UNK> farther , through his means . 1480.2898592323106
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . 1611.0973893413493
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ? 5284.391330684664
He <UNK> how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an <UNK> manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there . 3303.0772576352992
He drew a chair near her . 630.8127514757256
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 2635.8065783962056
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . 4827.493574728829
You take delight in <UNK> me . 630.1997486372561
Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . 4230.87751739428
That is all settled . " " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . 2908.8343122400024
Bennet and Mrs . 254.95760401582547
To Mr . Bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 3907.930485670137
In the first place , she persisted in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might be broken off . 4425.6781383201305
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . 2439.211798688206
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London . 1744.4791690883803
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 4103.601781571203
" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party . 3233.0550584546813
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
Could he , or the Lucases , have <UNK> on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the <UNK> more effectually to what they related ? 3504.4093965891925
no . " " I can much more easily believe Mr . Bingley ' s being imposed on , than that Mr . Wickham should <UNK> such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , <UNK> , every thing mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr . Darcy contradict it . 4687.625722459412
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . 1057.0916787636745
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 4597.668718613947
Every thing that is charming ! 494.3423521087372
I appeal to Mr . Darcy but let me not interrupt you , Sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the <UNK> converse of that young lady , whose <UNK> eyes are also <UNK> me . " The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 5286.831371668072
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 4236.216924412724
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . 2638.4731509688518
Mr . Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . 4800.9421571634375
Good bye . " She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she <UNK> about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . 3227.685060181264
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . 2823.97837436799
Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 1341.023318662926
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
But Mrs . 158.9212671001256
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! 1199.0420596621607
It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . 3230.8940037854422
" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister . 3375.919861790644
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the <UNK> light , seemed most improbable . 2220.5484681882235
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . 1339.2613890537607
She saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . 4148.198647066756
The others have been gone on to <UNK> , these three weeks . " She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . 3748.8105908901193
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . 1199.245606769398
Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not <UNK> . 3374.2905841989577
I am not <UNK> you know . 632.8279037243955
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh ! 1056.3879563435542
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . 3504.5401611357984
Elizabeth <UNK> the next morning to the same thoughts and <UNK> which had at length closed her eyes . 2221.9878906543245
<UNK> them next to your great uncle the judge . 1056.2062306174107
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the coachman ' s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs . 5040.8500083966455
Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . 3629.7234274459406
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . 5491.313266234436
She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . 3232.223783960469
" This is wholly unexpected . 496.8979064405888
" What could he mean ? 496.9471479793533
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the <UNK> of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . 3907.7459159704376
Bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . 2438.092307124029
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia . 2540.7455193748096
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted <UNK> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <UNK> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . 3568.6372036885405
It <UNK> me , I confess ; for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . 2438.110990067881
Elizabeth felt Jane ' s pleasure . 630.1921408644233
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of <UNK> . " He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . 4995.266619303593
During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <UNK> , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . 4460.491240280344
" It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . 1872.4876621668288
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . 2539.1790299581326
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . 771.7871973082291
Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs . 915.277100299981
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane . 3439.5993248604086
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . 1343.8048976020148
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s <UNK> name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father ' s estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think . 5409.686165039282
It cannot be concealed from any one . 771.3722872875792
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
<UNK> the works from public domain <UNK> editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works , so the Foundation and you ! can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties . 4054.1807426568243
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 2913.5221234398878
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . " Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . 4626.647623864786
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 3228.5286638808684
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . 1869.8060350228086
Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her . 2729.7775869331863
Are the others coming out ? " " I do not know . 1477.7343796190937
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 4463.3069280195605
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . 1867.6654243811015
" About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . " " Yes , " replied Wickham ; " his estate there is a noble one . 4430.037540036695
<UNK> requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much <UNK> and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements . 2907.8596312810523
She longed to see Mrs . 496.05666478495993
But here , by carrying with me one <UNK> source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <UNK> . 3373.9175306398024
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . 3230.6099693273345
<UNK> to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . 1198.759176237736
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , <UNK> to invite him to sit by herself . 2221.5289933653034
<UNK> as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . 4594.767023234578
He now wished it more than ever . 771.4068835656996
" Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " for Mrs . 2335.6148970374934
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 3306.349904152852
Mr . Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . 2540.6338807491893
It must be his own doing . He is his own master . 1478.9526449288905
Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . 3631.644630114318
<UNK> people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . 1056.2062306174107
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . 2732.245932445588
<UNK> is subject to the trademark license , especially <UNK> <UNK> . 1339.1308702616338
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
<UNK> away the letter immediately and <UNK> a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . " " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . 4716.83273089065
But that is nothing to us . 631.2561931133457
The garden <UNK> to the road , the house standing in it , the <UNK> pales and the <UNK> <UNK> , every thing declared they were <UNK> . 3076.499228785633
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . 3568.278146835438
Gardiner . 84.10084178660469
' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! What , all five out at once ? 4312.342072415686
" I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the <UNK> and public places . 2735.8011615861624
It became her turn to listen . 630.7493794751592
Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . 1867.3753618809815
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> . 5233.312210315786
" Your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . 1343.7745920717014
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs . 1199.5039806090233
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure . " The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs . 4825.982458982011
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement . 1872.783925055118
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . 1199.1662855462407
Of this she was perfectly <UNK> ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . 3438.8253998970486
The second began . 255.28695748018276
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . " Miss Bennet eagerly <UNK> all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . 3859.9083449391137
Society has claims on us all ; and I <UNK> myself one of those who consider intervals of <UNK> and amusement as desirable for every body . " Elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak <UNK> to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from <UNK> a <UNK> either from the <UNK> , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by <UNK> to dance . 5793.9626874516025
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 1868.7410614704181
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley . 2112.932972337531
His debts are to be paid , <UNK> , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased . 3630.1440033078957
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
His letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in <UNK> business , he was quick in its execution . 2331.024733549787
Good bye . 158.179405569226
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 3907.7951309550253
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish . 5769.082048676324
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . 2729.915493565309
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the <UNK> , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 4532.373163463126
<UNK> Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . " " If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . " " She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . 5140.75016939285
There is a mixture of <UNK> and self importance in his letter , which promises well . 1989.9543386450734
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . " Mrs . 3074.137771360709
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 3439.601037294055
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 2225.8549338381586
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
" And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! 2442.604538328859
It was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch street by noon . 2824.0887361504892
What could be more natural than his asking you again ? 1199.2566747732055
He was <UNK> his memory with <UNK> and noble names . 1201.1684505241271
" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . 1203.1369349885467
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . 1613.805626531301
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . 3228.4342023088525
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " <UNK> in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . 4462.301565828642
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . 2636.206806241977
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 2996.1025198686707
She shared in their attendance on Mrs . 772.0602735547817
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 3073.893403018591

" I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . 4776.213229985914
CHAPTER XVI . 158.33268212522805
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 2106.9236687314324
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal . " " True . 2638.12615017183
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was . 2821.512598795312
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? 3303.6356348884274
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law . " The loss of her daughter made Mrs . 2913.048319639139
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . 2222.6038564170385
Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . 1869.6970115449471
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 4594.536086521209
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . 2637.7778435575374
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <UNK> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <UNK> , and paid off every <UNK> of civility to Elizabeth . 4594.745330434393
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
<UNK> or twice she could discern a <UNK> blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . 2220.452668595813
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 3230.0345488444045
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . 3745.8858345535537
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr . Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and <UNK> the prospects of Mr . Wickham . <UNK> and <UNK> to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a <UNK> , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the <UNK> of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the <UNK> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd . I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ' s accidental information , that Bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . 6533.065668441118
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 3907.5744426423084
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . 1476.9470326103774
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of <UNK> , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 4390.8416342857
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 3372.5904403851696
The day passed much as the day before had done . 1201.4271973590862
But , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . 2541.254920257021
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him . 5609.55180000422
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . 2109.498169001055
Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes . 3504.527041682323
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . 5018.897502127274
Hurst were going out . 367.9200180310473
there is not a bit of fish to be got to day . 1476.7255405197404
She had got rid of two of the <UNK> which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . 3749.504823180322
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 4008.965664854354
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . 1989.3656997591906
I am so pleased so happy . 632.8034840932992
But the case is this . 495.90799783230324
How he lived I know not . 629.5411255801885
Elizabeth , after slightly <UNK> it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . 1868.7278164889035
He cannot afford it . 368.89224730590246
My feelings will not be repressed . 629.8233981251474
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . 4564.684932416859
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 5742.367801489317
Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . 3749.0497015392057
Very well . 158.17620057461198
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? 1744.180712826014
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . 1199.61626744982
Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at <UNK> , and Mrs . 1613.7413367718098
CHAPTER XVI . 158.33268212522805
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <UNK> every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were <UNK> abroad . 3957.8063171156346
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and <UNK> , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <UNK> her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . 5019.053367520558
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . " Her father lifted up his eyes . 2435.724280248778
Gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the <UNK> fashions . 2221.4488827435734
What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a <UNK> of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . " " Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . " " And what arts did he use to separate them ? " " He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling . 5818.699118454672
I guessed as much . " And though he exclaimed at the <UNK> , she found that it had been pretty much the case . 2825.4966049184477
What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . 2635.957868685406
And do you really love him quite well enough ? 1056.9837789130372
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her . 2995.0113127041514
A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it <UNK> from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . 2730.0529938282
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 3692.3824397626186
In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . 1199.5601424233178
But when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ' s <UNK> all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 4314.27970533066
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
I never saw such a long <UNK> in my life . 1203.0750900524984
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . 2224.126032534335
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 1611.2356908359313
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 3508.373484383555
But there are two things that I want very much to know one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . " " <UNK> ! 4103.32700429934
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . " Elizabeth was distressed . 1741.254420859115
" Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . 917.0709447397082
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . " " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? " " Indeed I had . 3569.330586678176
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . 1201.4194562137686
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . " Mr . Bingley followed his advice . 3153.7806346848756
<UNK> nature is so prone to fall into it ! 1056.2062306174107
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 2538.3285125999237
" Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 4905.923766976967
But your family owe me nothing . 631.2155250490399
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <UNK> infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . 3747.1521253317446
Mr . Darcy ! and so it does I <UNK> . 1201.8117636065365
Mr . Darcy may <UNK> himself . " " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried Elizabeth . 2639.7549620961713
Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . 3504.840143597713
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in <UNK> <UNK> to be her husband , might then have <UNK> in its proper place . 3154.975793382726
The letter was to this effect " MY DEAR <UNK> , " I wish you joy . 1992.2046679373593
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church . 2820.759118221015
Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . 2638.758677898674
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 773.1015691009133
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of <UNK> for them . 2992.471484198056
F . 83.99007840409676
As for your Elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what <UNK> could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye <UNK> , so remarkably fine , might be copied . " At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . 5060.10823877612
He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 4274.116160159655
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they <UNK> . 2824.871811019387
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 4055.098345760349
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it . 1867.9022980876427
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . 1200.574007583155
I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . 4803.270445131051
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 1340.0900213622324
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . 2545.0573620934742
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she <UNK> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . " Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . Wickham ' s attentions . 5553.848770172488
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great <UNK> . 1611.6527623034658
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 4686.712760300931
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs . 1867.4148980651685
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . 1742.6858233358732
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . 1743.7826526249864
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . 1058.80012312165
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long . 1742.4390213766042
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 1058.6607673316391
I wish you had been there . 632.3735943527649
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . 1867.282991981462
Does your charge give you much trouble ? 769.7181374234376
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 3229.261659526802
My sisters may write to me . 629.8071668182307
Your <UNK> makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a <UNK> . " " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! 3907.5249453352603
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . 1339.7941101186907
By tea time however the <UNK> had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . 4007.206142993279
But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . 1342.5522491915915
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to <UNK> such pleasures . 4006.8559900046967
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . 3961.8702414529303
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . 5283.897319673944
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 4799.61683216578
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her <UNK> , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . " " She had better have <UNK> at home , " cried Elizabeth ; " perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours . 5318.918174734834
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 2437.5911632242205
His plan did not vary on seeing them . Miss Bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his <UNK> notions of what was due to <UNK> ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice . 4007.528694019561
You cannot have been always at Longbourn . " Elizabeth looked surprised . 1478.167923264163
The <UNK> or <UNK> of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining <UNK> . 1992.0701896294163
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <UNK> as these , what would have been her sensations ? 2908.257670745856
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 3303.6080384889447
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained . 1477.1064476767056
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . 770.2073155873894
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
<UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her . 4271.699000395743
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger <UNK> than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance <UNK> and <UNK> . 3439.2063772247316
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 2436.590838184721
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a <UNK> fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered <UNK> to the repeated <UNK> of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 5333.332654055425
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . 3155.108718229809
She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . 4391.040133663282
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 2993.4259654432917
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better <UNK> room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . 5121.787111371659
You know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . 2108.6359006889365
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . 2636.3014201368965
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be <UNK> into it ? " " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to <UNK> with rather more <UNK> the degree of importance which is to <UNK> to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . 5881.24600420676
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . 3908.2229761657027
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . " " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . " " Pride , " observed Mary , who <UNK> herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe . 4902.387531024474
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring . 1344.9492939185868
Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> . 3855.393235759148
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . 2333.856280652543
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him . 4313.854674625654
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 1056.676029673165
Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master . 2106.964334460174
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 1058.9618975129542
Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . 4057.2490941091155
There can be no occasion for your going so soon . 1199.4145363366572
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . 3804.0198052601354
But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . 3910.2843659681766
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 2909.5512650221426
Bennet said only , " <UNK> , nonsense ! " " What can be the meaning of that <UNK> exclamation ? " cried he . 2822.5163266019567
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . 1057.8586947821607
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? 3152.88169580529
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 2442.3292696411463
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as <UNK> , were in very good time . 3629.478825385331
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 3910.5711518423736
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 1203.3411253197432
Such were the gentle <UNK> of Mrs . 769.7998701543706
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 3509.2535713621
Most earnestly did she <UNK> to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . 2635.267305206137
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short <UNK> . " " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . 4530.489101340696
He heard her with astonishment . 495.52484391042543
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . 4626.780057339843

" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt . 2825.8753944591085
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . 3855.666501347399
These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 3073.63521805212
" Excuse my interference . It was kindly meant . " " <UNK> girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . 3859.8020816537028
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . 1342.3301150117104
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an <UNK> man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a <UNK> , had nothing to say to her . 4826.197702239265
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 3634.8216202333933
Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . 771.8504474070555
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . 913.8313006718831
I cannot quite agree with you there . 773.1562883768914
Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . 1339.640468263333
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 2911.5214399412794
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . 1340.6401723354652
Bennet was most <UNK> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 4497.398082500071
This match , to which you have the presumption to <UNK> , can never take place . 1989.51250870434
And now here ' s Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 3856.097578302962
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish . 1611.525802447222
On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a <UNK> , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy . 4825.935469598694
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 2993.410907471238
The first part of Mrs . 495.8390983353258
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . " " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister . 4926.2221853647125
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . " " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be <UNK> beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen . 4564.705329622386
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was Elizabeth ' s intimate friend . 2638.4687257082837
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 1994.4714837087295

F . . <UNK> You agree to <UNK> and hold the Foundation , the trademark owner , any <UNK> or <UNK> of the Foundation , anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement , and any volunteers associated with the <UNK> , <UNK> and distribution of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works , <UNK> from all liability , costs and expenses , including legal fees , that arise directly or <UNK> from any of the following which you do or cause to occur a distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg tm work , <UNK> alteration , <UNK> , or additions or <UNK> to any Project Gutenberg tm work , and c any <UNK> you cause . 5722.255393960124
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . 2820.8002836057117
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that . 4191.690946984612
The adieu is <UNK> itself . 495.78287497128713
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> . 3909.9204144145456
" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . " He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very <UNK> thing , and called out to her , " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr . Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain . 6308.0830798088755
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . 3230.9613713081594
She could think only of her letter . 772.1878801851865
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , <UNK> every chance of <UNK> himself by marrying well ? 3689.2384748557965
Darcy said nothing at all . 494.28639462458545
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go . 1056.6652401249742
Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> . 1870.569975631533
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not <UNK> me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . 4715.966095466985
I have not that pain . 497.04230854941136
CHAPTER VIII . 158.33268212522805
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? " " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . 4995.632353497713
" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living . 2226.1217113192965
But I must write no more . 631.4753050090014
The next was in these words . 631.1926923670715
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said . 3568.740987454041
My mother was in <UNK> , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! 3505.3079647840036
CHAPTER XVI . 158.33268212522805
yes I understand you perfectly . " " I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . " " That is as it happens . 3803.1390816789963
Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual <UNK> ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the <UNK> of his thoughts . 4743.692496125698
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . 3300.6231219266942
Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . 3802.8740880875384
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . " " My beauty you had early <UNK> , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . 4533.381970218795
On the following Monday , Mrs . 629.6060544129396
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 1872.070766891897
Mr . Collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . 3571.6019066443064
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 3074.301094973527
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to <UNK> the engagements that had been made for him . 4101.0679257602005
Poor dear child ! 254.27907262783975
Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . 1339.687938736531
I am sure I <UNK> ' <UNK> get a wink of sleep all night . 1746.7195560070384
My temper I dare not vouch for . It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world . 2821.4173597587046
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of <UNK> whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to <UNK> , she began to regret that he came . 4657.225899153654
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 4231.999960503857
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <UNK> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . 4230.81984052428
" He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 3444.9904317951045
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . 1741.8611041177408
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . " " My dear , you flatter me . 4462.258181208625
My dear Mr . Bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? 2108.589636186446
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley ' s heart were entertained . 3074.7771696245054
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most <UNK> in inviting Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 5436.4945788941495
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . 1339.5810157727662
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder . 2537.447375461071
And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined . 3908.223186786065
Is not it so , Mrs . 629.3874594644163
It was only said , ' <UNK> , George Wickham , <UNK> . 1479.7619628623327
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . " " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . " " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . 4878.485641128457
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . 3569.538763484144
He seldom appeared really animated . 495.5037716455499
" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . 1745.882038027438
What congratulations will then flow in ! 629.5976525781532
Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . 3302.3934811042323
" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . 4465.687127888479
I am most seriously displeased . " Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . 3306.349936391273
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence . 4496.558350267658
" I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . 3751.596843822476
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 4594.536224766785
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 4147.869998267537
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . 2224.1416291788673
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . 2107.8037848770623
Her <UNK> wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . 1477.5708570051322
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . 1201.4817667667012
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . 4901.70272235994
Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . 3073.8121196193565
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . 1743.9792206756374
Come be quick , be quick ! 629.314508610612
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . 1341.4764062560382
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . 1613.6953378453134
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . 2537.792546691028
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . 1743.9490674994286
" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr . Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing after all . I consider it as one of the first <UNK> of polished societies . " " Certainly , Sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in <UNK> amongst the less polished societies of the world . Every <UNK> can dance . " Sir William only smiled . 4975.8900181024255
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . 3228.9255217735786
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . 4499.548258018148
Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 2224.2071991206353
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . 1342.0295432249848
Bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . 1869.4067924522553
He can be a <UNK> companion if he thinks it worth his while . 1613.059506562583
Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . 1743.4811056735077
" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . " " Is my father in town ? " " Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . " " And have you heard from him often ? " " We have heard only once . 4599.460833325192
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . 1741.033748005281
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell . 1741.0077621422854
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . 4427.159582481482
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth ! 1872.2488866190188
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 1198.8611198999254
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . 1476.799387262819
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 4925.451714245982
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 4529.438925917309
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . 2911.139445137626
<UNK> , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . " " And do you <UNK> it to either of those ? " " Yes ; to the last . 3958.561125045244
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 4876.5917364720235
Darcy may be guessed . 367.85640605712416
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 3075.5436826462196
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was <UNK> her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs . 4799.6366335193525
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . 1741.1505604067859
" He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived . 2442.57692291891
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <UNK> , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 4802.422837326032
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 4056.962412508405
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 2635.3779856045317
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 3909.1431884285807
<UNK> wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . 4100.6559612964575
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . " Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . 4191.606952537164
Mr . Bennet protested against any description of finery . 1058.7887111547789
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it <UNK> , has surprised me a good deal . 3505.268826716601
<UNK> , teazing , man ! 494.167333080278
" Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever <UNK> , that your resentment once created was <UNK> . 4661.155068668932
that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! 1610.8820395766004
" My dear <UNK> , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of <UNK> each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s t te t te between two women can never end without a quarrel . 4598.516321551353
She then took a large house in <UNK> street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . 2224.0986075409774
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned . 5632.052362459781
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 3908.248469818387
<UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . 4562.145645700737
I am sure my sisters must all envy me . 1060.9332739603149
Can I speak <UNK> ? 367.81587409687074
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 4311.629802327188
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were <UNK> the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . 4009.458124645576
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . 3569.052755279713
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 5302.43424618318
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
I am very , very sorry . 632.8034840932992
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . 2538.2462315690254
" And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . 2441.7904086349745
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey . 1989.2718047821445
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance . 1989.6732625400007
<UNK> and pride are different things , though the words are often used <UNK> . 1740.864894664956
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs . 1476.9471023042515
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as <UNK> of derivative works , <UNK> , <UNK> and research . 2538.90147995168
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! 1867.1506909794105
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . 1203.7430783189188
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with <UNK> civility that they were perfectly needless . 2638.785900055006
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side . 5040.8940027723775
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . 2331.1348836883194
I promised them so <UNK> ! 496.7610402846689
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 5080.699874182881
If I could but see you as happy ! 913.3889331742821
" What do you think ? 496.9753233802675
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 4976.769502811147
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does . 769.7544903248415
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . 1992.032675511042
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional <UNK> in praise of his own humble abode , and the <UNK> it was receiving , he was happily employed <UNK> the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . 4231.392886270437
He begged pardon for having displeased her . 771.4068835656996
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " With such kind of <UNK> of their parties and good <UNK> , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . 4495.900108590868
" <UNK> in other words , you are determined to have him . 1481.3346908672409
Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . 2910.681562343001
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . 2821.5959613212317
" Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy . 1873.2297848916999
I am prodigiously proud of him . 632.795330564996
Mr . Darcy <UNK> it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . 4659.014976116241
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character . 2223.2944187803864
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 2331.0544355822567
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . 1870.2772305188155
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and Mrs . 3750.911815561631
" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of <UNK> in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ' s regard for me . 3912.7683180748695
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . " " Oh ! 3692.2685495543396
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas . 915.307789310607
" You are <UNK> , Lizzy . 632.5642545170126
Had his character been known , this could not have happened . 1339.5339345570285
A younger son , you know , must be <UNK> to self denial and dependence . " " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either . 3568.3815757093175
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 1198.759176237736
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 4562.177452238746
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy . 3804.122536812657
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with <UNK> civility , " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ? 3907.9304559105585
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . 1989.271806684789
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . 3567.94160301615
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 4562.948562375761

Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . 1990.6036002533178
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 4853.418854894526
" ' Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much . 1872.5141285470681

If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . 4007.5779971569855
The <UNK> <UNK> of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in <UNK> with her opinion of each . 4497.645721808875
They will take care not to <UNK> their income . 1057.4170758957503
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room . 2220.97209688296

Section . 83.99007840409676
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . " " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . 4314.981450934054
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be <UNK> so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . 3154.291199892686
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . " " If I were as rich as Mr . Darcy , " cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , " I should not care how proud I was . 4425.668098651702
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . 2333.812035487082
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 1867.4284481534162
how acutely did she now feel it . 769.7908243509801
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 2226.011957741298
" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried Jane . 1873.3060501654354
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 1058.296699551672
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , <UNK> Lucases . 3373.233017379506

But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 2733.0971138537952
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 2732.972661368505
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 4189.310077668831
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! 2635.709516457649
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . 4231.555005016809
She comes to us to day . 631.4037889968785
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by <UNK> the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . 4311.9349542489945
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than <UNK> . 1479.5141263308549
He takes them now for people of fashion . " The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she <UNK> a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his <UNK> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . 4717.199925554821
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so <UNK> to you . 4596.956585106636
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 3075.026287557265
" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself . 2542.7753360458737
And then when we came away it was such fun ! 1199.5828132758734
Heaven forbid ! 158.16339304401765
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or <UNK> reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . 5196.746006333194
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 3077.275278129775
And then we were so merry all the way home ! 1199.6054845568922
It was all pride and <UNK> . 631.3561125510714
And is it really true ? 494.6767163140885
" Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " From the former . 3751.8894591401995
Collins so before you came . 494.3911731810981
My courage always <UNK> with every attempt to <UNK> me . " " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . " Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . 5621.67185682574
I do not deserve it . 496.9932444141593
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 2732.7030542526486
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . 1340.7349773756832
But , really , I know not what to say . 1201.7086279796104
Did he know of their intending to go off ? 1056.3024750767702
<UNK> of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where . 1476.6639668791763
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw . 3234.1862621559408
I shall now know how to act . 773.2109767117785
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to <UNK> from the <UNK> qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . 3152.0462202167473
If his own vanity , however , did not <UNK> him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . 3689.2137763519986
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . 1869.6307649662128
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . 4388.778557054718
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <UNK> by the possessor , and often without any attention to the <UNK> of the performance . 3076.6082703692614
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . 3910.1020184118206
What are men to <UNK> and mountains ? 770.0173881085834
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley . 2439.4173047831196
Well , much good may it do them ! 913.0128333661802
She opened the door , and met Maria in the <UNK> place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza ! 3155.490122782353
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " " But I was embarrassed . " " And so was I . " " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " " A man who had felt less , might . " " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 5477.325122376163
That tall , proud man . " " Good gracious ! 1199.1326344205554
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . 3958.7904887073946
Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ' s arm <UNK> to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s . 3228.6508803839934
To Mr . and Mrs . 494.7271246104191
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 2438.8821500530257
He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? 2911.0278783218337
As no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins ' s scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . 3301.9840330595257
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 1989.47262617278
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present <UNK> of good will are highly <UNK> , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . 5159.903079217338
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it . 4530.997036665083
She was busily <UNK> through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . 3633.031991284122
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 2635.5023486882237
" Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . 2336.8121004088357
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . 3077.669617686447
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 3570.8250582146384
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley ' s behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . 5040.306865095395
Well ! 84.01782968566927
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> . 1613.7777849618199
If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 2538.5367789201423
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . 2730.0805857962823
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs . 2436.082883959787
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good <UNK> will <UNK> it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth <UNK> lest her mother should be exposing herself again . 4274.396814536692
It is unaccountable ! 255.27483240678364
Collins ' s <UNK> of meat were too large for her family . 1477.0573761202068
Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 3855.256865933153
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to <UNK> people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? 3958.37891172709
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the <UNK> of his confidence in his friend . 3301.31380828317
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s <UNK> . 1741.847855013826
" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . 1874.0087004234028
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 2911.986925682511
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . 3568.368706549658
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . 2823.083837978098
I did not expect such a compliment . " " Did not you ? 1615.5737667767082
<UNK> me whilst you can . " " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . " " Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . " " I cannot believe it . 3691.0681982611677
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 3855.5048139743276
" Good Heaven ! 255.98670188419564
" I am trying to make it out . " " And what is your success ? " She shook her head . 2642.461247889522
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr . Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . 4351.17734420004
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . 3801.5311654136117
He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 3748.270055571591
" What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? 2226.0119441777388
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a <UNK> as that , it might be of essential consequence . 3228.3276277121263
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . 1744.037625536062
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to <UNK> his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be <UNK> <UNK> . 5059.911862613052
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . 1611.7165313661376
Her affections had been continually <UNK> , but never without an object . 1477.558536419614
She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . 2733.693023766277
Pray forgive me , if I have been very <UNK> , or at least do not punish me so far , as to <UNK> me from <UNK> . 3073.59434264129
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time . 2331.0798138238215
" Well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? 3158.450859366917
It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement . 3154.6569698316016
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . 2441.3201667740796
<UNK> as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . 2330.120900529913
Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day . 3910.3963654805343
I . 84.71807911442343
I shall see her in January . 632.43862405886
He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , <UNK> friend . 1992.8230202748064
I congratulate her . 255.9121696915202
Bennet ' s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . 1869.526019569323
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . 1741.2670758774989
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 3371.0745447526774
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative . 3153.1660431301734
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . 3568.3295023544924
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . 3300.5028418520396

CHAPTER V . 158.32627053238474
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 2541.0882565410698
The evening passed quietly , <UNK> by any thing extraordinary . 1201.3704234288068
Jane looked a little <UNK> than usual , but more <UNK> than Elizabeth had expected . 1867.414505558738
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 2910.2567262108278
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . 2107.140738088533
But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . 3571.2505701216423
I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " " And they must marry ! 1995.4438299375256
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . 1339.7829899598016
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his <UNK> . 3629.2736218709183
" Did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ? 2226.6966626543185
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . 1477.0206919929371
" You forget that I have made no answer . 1060.6503620159033
You deserve no such attention . 494.9951846314517
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 3960.735313534056
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . 3301.2767947265033
She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 4104.1819575679265
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . 2992.3348387028345
She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . 4427.896635645259
But we must <UNK> the tide of malice , and <UNK> into the wounded <UNK> of each other , the <UNK> of sisterly consolation . " Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " <UNK> as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is <UNK> that one false step <UNK> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <UNK> than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 5750.918070964775
" Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane ' s . " CHAPTER XVIII . 3157.1785803130488
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him . 1870.1339921558588
She practises very constantly . " " So much the better . 1342.3998465417783
I hope you have destroyed the letter . 773.1015574573752
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my <UNK> on your privilege of universal good will . 2537.5441018679417
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . 1479.8606879098188
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . 4598.621481653966
Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself . 4595.661934493904
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <UNK> . 1615.573730735865
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the <UNK> curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two <UNK> of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . The envelope itself was likewise full . <UNK> her way along the lane , she then began it . 4743.822649502652
There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . 2436.6610455774
No thanks to his gallantry for that . 769.8725070031294
Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently . 771.8595406448133
The day of his and Lydia ' s departure soon came , and Mrs . 1744.0661197067054
So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 2330.217225237045
She studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . 1870.5309821863752
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . " " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . 3078.8718663728246
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . 3504.696896559008
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr . Darcy . She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! Yet it did , and even a third . 5196.906700932288
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . 1743.975089890239
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , <UNK> , manner of talking to her brother . 3688.4518410870864
I enquired after their brother , of course . 916.3773255622111
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . 3858.1401731944693
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . 3302.839347089436
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . 1742.439036111466
" Oh ! 159.45205162549917
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . 4389.698586244557
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in <UNK> it after this explanation . " Mr . Darcy , who was <UNK> against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . 4659.62221598417
CHAPTER XV . 158.33268212522805
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open <UNK> rejected . 2996.6083105279317
" And pray may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a <UNK> tone , " Is it in address that he improves ? 3078.8914779417355
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild <UNK> of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . 3958.655731124163
She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . 4531.721473503976
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time . 2436.6591632339637
Mr . Darcy ! 255.4628273610238
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took <UNK> in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 3229.0464667260253
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? 1340.029052031957
I thought it my duty to give the <UNK> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well <UNK> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . 5381.282666005188
When the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , <UNK> her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment <UNK> . 4562.9379430257595
I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister . 1871.9911831154836
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . 3441.2155485269036
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . 2224.7273379808657
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . 3441.2178258538393
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . 2439.5021562191964
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " " <UNK> do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 5080.656062463706
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . 2823.221755011322
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . 4314.234449448378
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 769.8180624960132
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas ' s last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the <UNK> were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three <UNK> <UNK> at least . 4147.623056091517
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <UNK> . 3570.5039035128957
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . 1868.7404078905413
But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . " " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother . 3805.4172111796483
" So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find . 2441.4719316575815
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . 3371.1540598781457
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . 3152.168264766884
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . 3300.649852058225
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 4772.186126461867
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . 2220.903987191893
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 4101.856311449415
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should <UNK> an occasion of <UNK> his respect towards any body connected with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared . Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . 5675.909372135317
Not handsome enough to dance with ! 629.4441417659627
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . 1614.071923654569
Collins , you must send a servant with them . 1056.6334937721633
She was going to the <UNK> ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of <UNK> , just fit to be killed . " Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . 4498.475781126744
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the <UNK> girls in the country . 3958.3543641797355
<UNK> since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 2537.3367249602293
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? 1199.5834705201614
in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 2635.599285877677
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night . 2330.2034620932636
Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . 3301.475616236646
Thank Heaven ! 158.17300154466707
Five daughters <UNK> entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . 2107.0050855903805
He danced only four dances ! 495.5318681978573
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 3911.454268283762
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . 2538.3423478278605
Why any fear of detection ? 494.27236857080004
Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in Mrs . 3439.167295313502
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance <UNK> , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . 2635.805420335861
When I last saw her , she was not very promising . 1340.0296906844596
What relates to yourself , is as follows . 913.0918619813933
" But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy . 4355.650765766428
" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet ' s manor . 4012.487299212857
You are safe from me . " " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . " " And your defect is a <UNK> to hate every body . " " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . " " Do let us have a little music , " cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . " Louisa , you will not mind my <UNK> Mr . Hurst . " Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . 5858.795354878035
At such a distance as that , you know , things are <UNK> misrepresented . " " Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips . 2993.236528704282
Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley ' s continued absence . 2333.48449135028
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ' s beauty . 1867.4546128804436
I am sure you must feel it so . " " Oh ! 1482.8817929873267
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 3302.4202388434924
" Yours , c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a <UNK> fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . " " Oh ! 4930.733484203798
" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . " " You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . 2914.7690412830734
Mr . Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the <UNK> and go to sleep . 2638.440212200953
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her <UNK> , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . 4275.242927914502
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of <UNK> , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than <UNK> anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 4427.983325735939
They then went away . 368.4430053357185
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . 4496.952007069606
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . " " Very true ; and if I had my will , we should . 3152.6544859444775
Mr . Wickham ' s chief object was <UNK> my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of <UNK> himself on me , was a strong inducement . 3858.253547177655
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 4626.012986042175
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 3371.2335544169546
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement <UNK> the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be <UNK> to make the <UNK> disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law . 3855.775354280823
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
CHAPTER XVII . 158.33268212522805
But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came . 2540.6459311873386
Mr . and Mrs . 369.3319016231363
To no creature had it been revealed , where <UNK> was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 4425.086510105031
Bennet thus began the <UNK> conversation . " Oh ! 1057.8158452435687
What a fine thing for our girls ! " " How so ? 1477.2662422303292
To Caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit . 2330.752824014038
But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . 4352.952197011702
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <UNK> to her <UNK> , afforded no <UNK> of her distress . 3077.1253542564777
Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . 3504.435582822402
Well , but now for my news it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? 2635.7373211100685
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . " " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . 5423.410520152534
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . 3153.8631022276486
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ? 4565.3077774769345
Catherine , weak <UNK> , irritable , and completely under Lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self <UNK> and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . 3745.7341129664946
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <UNK> . " " And this is your real opinion ! 4716.430506154561
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate . 1989.1107352868921
" I should never have said Mrs . 773.8150163346146
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 3855.6534408080834
They had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister . 1612.254676445013
When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . 3630.0163423775252
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed . 4926.497713091627
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . 4147.3675844061545
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . 1615.7135164509803
The children have been wanting me this half hour . 1058.7143707886908
In pompous <UNK> on his side , and civil <UNK> on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton . 2730.4918972303785
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it . 2736.2751390524236
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well . 1614.2471865966252
At length however Mrs . 368.0876642495003
Elizabeth was <UNK> enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 2539.1236152023475
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 4531.730713493464
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . 4312.07081593769
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " CHAPTER XVIII . 2112.106310418899
Good girl ! 158.17299927526295
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 5121.852984082905
Only look at her . 367.83325587827477
You may have drawn him in . " " If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . " " Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? 3569.9140562896355
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will <UNK> you ; and so generous , that you will always <UNK> your income . " " I hope not so . 4102.891837025955
CHAPTER VIII . 158.33268212522805
Hurst began again . 254.3420475285631
When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . " " Your plan is a good one , " replied Elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . 4949.945212321134
We were always good friends ; and now we are better . " " True . 1867.7448429935419
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . 1340.3520496696788
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . " " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be <UNK> with . 4193.589162390159
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character . 3076.741926872101
They <UNK> every attempt of Mrs . 630.1516568209145
From that moment I observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 3438.930670795013
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . " " I should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother . 4190.570894793029
" He only told me , what I have now told you . " Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart <UNK> with indignation . 3157.503908604176
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . 2538.013480251084
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 5503.851184869781
but there were two or three much <UNK> in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to <UNK> it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . 3567.7860092946585
' Ah ! 158.1665955100683
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . Oh ! 1613.6531811616796
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . " As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the <UNK> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . 4686.539246967963
From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an <UNK> chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . 4188.763570008472
" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . 1344.6635666389468
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . 914.3917661377292
You shall hear what she says . " She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . Hurst had a house . 4426.089906537002
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . " CHAPTER V . 2220.8082284332613
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the <UNK> , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening . 5622.523946591648
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! 1056.3772602062345
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . " The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they <UNK> satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had <UNK> Mrs . 4901.788339689154
Heaven and <UNK> ! of what are you thinking ? 1056.2169250230036
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 2333.6335107797954
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <UNK> ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had <UNK> , in his offer to herself . 4231.072698219669
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " " Oh ! 2221.912856135897
I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 3079.482280211077
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 4189.377740653676
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . " " She is a very fine looking woman ! 2998.028410557174
You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her <UNK> , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . 4009.894500580934
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of inviting him . " " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . 4146.441583051834
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . 1992.177782225529
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 2733.1287675873996
A regard for the <UNK> would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . 2820.854739916331
My aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . " " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . 4145.888695905102
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . 3751.1646084307877
GARDINER . " " Is it possible ! " cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . 1989.5268697274073
She blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . 2995.924652561868
and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! 1198.9290171186879

The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of <UNK> , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her <UNK> <UNK> . 4996.695654637495

or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " " My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . 3745.8984665015882
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very <UNK> in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . 4563.7297695422485
Long . 84.01585288197488
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . 2440.885296445589

A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . 3371.31292164598
They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . 4772.687905499635

Bennet . " My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received <UNK> at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right <UNK> Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose <UNK> and <UNK> has preferred me to the valuable <UNK> of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <UNK> myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those <UNK> and <UNK> which are <UNK> by the <UNK> of England . 5464.0451245927225

About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged . 3227.5639996592413

The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the <UNK> of the first . 4056.9983438158115
Oh , Lydia ! " " I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 3568.563713489427
" I am sorry it went off . 773.9885113561064
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . 1991.6672384919543
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . 3302.849994571114
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . 1199.5153162543613
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . 2733.1702724351035
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged . 3300.5028532185806
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . 3439.3512108389837
The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 3858.1301756449525
" Yes if Darcy does not put it off again . 1203.1141953553629
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . 2110.443164657526
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <UNK> your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter . 4104.94449320095
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <UNK> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 3230.634289352159
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library . " Mrs . 5742.768413321674
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . 2330.9178835702037
My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them . 1477.4734610639835
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . 1477.1677999234216
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? 1339.3325273525475
why is not every body as happy ? " Elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . 3370.8493179059165
She blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who <UNK> their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . 2733.168320662857
His brother in law , Mr . Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr . Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble <UNK> ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . 4744.431846790046
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . 2732.94497575745
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 770.3428545547338
<UNK> my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . 1198.7478477380632
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . 3572.643157583745
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention . 1479.0364597006592

The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , <UNK> , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . 4233.360874376893
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . 2331.189945098982
And she was only sixteen last June . 770.3155592100242
It is Mr . Bingley I am sure . 915.0420518211229
" <UNK> Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at <UNK> , if the drawing room were larger ; but <UNK> is too far off ! 3807.231252408617
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . 2996.389314117429
After a short pause , her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me . 2221.190803157671
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? 1056.9944796746624
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 2220.7126286997213
how can it affect them ? " " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! 2993.305606524434
I told Mrs . 255.92577179136464
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your ' s seems to have been . 2823.9369536328495
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . 2823.221784308711
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost . 2911.5745309627705
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and <UNK> of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their <UNK> . 4852.647480365518
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to <UNK> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . 3857.236842893248
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it <UNK> . 4355.02430590452
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . " " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " " Has your governess left you ? " " We never had any governess . " " No governess ! 4425.438816829496
how he must have felt it ! " " I never saw any one so shocked . 1989.4194583734973
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . 1744.637867833371
Your mother <UNK> upon your accepting it . 769.9087129874349
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 3570.8225315168543
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? 2107.424749249349
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . " " Lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . " " I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a <UNK> of character . 5103.7107606766795
But of course she did not mention my name to you . " " Yes , she did . " " And what did she say ? " " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well . 4192.745722783565
<UNK> , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . 1198.7478477380632
As she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs . 1199.3129653506476
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . 2538.452961836595
My poor father ! 254.53930109378217
. 34.63748678533662
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> . 3376.1192063409235
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . 3228.03394012131
I have a high respect for your nerves . 916.6864817344066
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . 3908.843737165082
<UNK> him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her . 3628.977911058721
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . 4772.315506987684
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling . 4054.5873775672453
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the <UNK> of a considerable <UNK> , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . 4425.8596327015875
His <UNK> to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 2730.5745851005718
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . 5121.137445960835
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this <UNK> . 3152.1276421253738
" Oh ! 159.45205162549917
At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . " With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 4388.392267147391
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ' s way . " Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <UNK> . 4271.950320310249
CHAPTER I . 158.33268212522805
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 2821.4436274602526
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her <UNK> , by dwelling on them . 2224.23753548337
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new <UNK> . 2908.2030536314123
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before . 4390.176857694334
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly <UNK> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . 3908.2600299246587
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . 2908.9683854946297
For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently . 2908.724590931625
She went on . 255.42245915187004
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . 3303.6222624467305
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were <UNK> in her favour . 4717.9565471408105

Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . 1868.7808044895673
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . 4231.600171945945
Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the <UNK> ? 3748.721297694167
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . " " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal <UNK> of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first <UNK> for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . 5352.548331648563
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago . 1611.160237955185
<UNK> , <UNK> , . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations . 1989.0167382896461
Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the <UNK> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . 4876.6977379999125
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr . Wickham . 2107.316803355746
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 3804.26741357204
" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <UNK> , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss <UNK> ' s . " " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . " " Oh ! 5124.626239691417
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . 1992.4440336911052
I am not to be <UNK> into anything so wholly unreasonable . 1344.3973237845369
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . 1060.5166089078082
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs . 769.79992936926
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . 2439.0695293511703
There could not <UNK> in the world two men , over whom Mr . Darcy could have such <UNK> influence . 2436.302098968944
I think she will be pleased with the <UNK> . " Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs . 3305.322578903247
You are a gentleman ' s daughter . 770.8562190647052
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 4314.315696926603
And what do you think she said besides ? 913.4480975063303
Its business office is located at North <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , . 1867.0448014195422
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . 1478.2541143250094
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of <UNK> from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a <UNK> horse . 3303.4081893823327
Her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 4007.6371396684194
I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to <UNK> such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room . 4566.327683941377
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . " " Oh ! 4055.7466278159222
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , <UNK> , absurd . 3230.9864067705994
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 5410.255076148473
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . 3908.0516450931364
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . 2730.342711044195
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . 4351.969478964961
and so did Mrs . 367.87955770597796
She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . 4801.483925321508
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! 1989.2181280773873
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . " " <UNK> out , " said Mrs . 2442.3119249699434
Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 2729.9845657235187
Gardiner smiled . 158.33895367903943
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . 1058.9618975129542
These are <UNK> , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . 3151.9922722577276
<UNK> , stay , I will go myself . 912.6647652804965
Mr . Collins ! " " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . 2824.210309850647
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . 2635.7920817112827
CHAPTER XIX . 158.33268212522805
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? 2537.405902274855
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s . 1872.2297606308323
The Foundation ' s <UNK> or federal tax <UNK> number is . 1341.9010488972147
Such a disappointment ! 254.32859523634033
It was in the <UNK> and the <UNK> , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . 2733.0734052345642
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . 1476.8363530115626
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be <UNK> to you to let them go alone . " " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " " Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . 4830.02292519438
He had never had the slightest suspicion . 771.5616356447771
<UNK> , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ? 1339.1664682450298
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! How much of good or evil must be done by him ! 4272.246022235912
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . 2221.1085510283533
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . 1994.3039531682648
His apparent partiality had <UNK> , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . 2331.066035825988
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . 1056.9944796746624
But vanity , not love , has been my folly . <UNK> with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . 4390.627331175787

She had been <UNK> pleased to approve of both the <UNK> , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . 2733.6238067139175
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . 1741.4874669109524
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 1741.4352530431615
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold enough to say before how much I like him . 3504.605516522218
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 4057.8467890251136
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 2540.528378101322
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . 3227.711949393821
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 1741.9520475150712
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
" No ; but it must be done soon . " Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . 2997.535235366435
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 3748.7473448280925
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 5924.283944464831
In ran Mrs . 254.55713674807217
But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my <UNK> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . 4233.3817361300935
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 4312.9218256110735
Teaze him laugh at him . <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . " " But upon my honour I do not . 3300.9297937135852
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . " " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an <UNK> , <UNK> disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will <UNK> the whole room , and be handed down to <UNK> with all the <UNK> of a <UNK> . " " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he . 5950.361267406036
The loo table , however , did not appear . 1058.735808980387
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . 1482.0055464698967
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr . Darcy . " She then sought her eldest sister , who had <UNK> to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . 3806.5879570814577
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 3441.257359127766
Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . 3371.855049614047
But papa is so disagreeable . " " A little <UNK> bathing would set me up for ever . " " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty . 3910.9605528717275
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . 3690.65084349149
I fancy she was wanted about the <UNK> <UNK> . 1060.1630152277335
Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . 1613.4755592562808
Caroline is incapable of wilfully <UNK> any one ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . " " That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine . 4350.719138610679
I had not an idea of it . " Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . 3634.412412645965
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 1479.6104364783776
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can ' t think . 1867.9809599809507
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth <UNK> out the coffee , in so close a <UNK> , that there was not a single <UNK> near her , which would admit of a chair . 4100.217587354244
If this be the case , he deserves you . 1056.9309411296924
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very <UNK> to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . 2821.047816285599
Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . 1200.713498918902
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 2636.763949167023
Why must she be <UNK> about the country , because her sister had a cold ? 1867.2035218002504
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? 1056.3452526995177
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister . 3074.3415367808457
<UNK> it , Kitty ? " Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . 1867.044822051223
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 1613.9300353291615
The t te t te surprised them . 771.8145447989317
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? " " One of them does . " " Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . 4188.577485651167
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . 629.4684352680385
You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not . 1479.367757350829
" How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! 2998.0696155708883
It was agreed to . 369.27483359813345
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . 3801.856141149865
" <UNK> . 159.36818138080213
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . 4718.471950445909
" He seems to be a most <UNK> and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so <UNK> as to let him come to us again . " " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . " " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . " Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of <UNK> , marrying , and <UNK> his <UNK> whenever it were required . 5931.285537877417
He does not want abilities . 495.5037716455499
I write rather slowly . " " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! 2640.783476531119
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 5303.037470737438
I only hope they may have half my good luck . 1202.9841935336474
Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . 3372.779720348705
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy . 3301.2771863600365
" You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 2913.865807708522
My father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . 4145.935678405112
" And is this all ? " cried Elizabeth . 1060.564754297733
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly <UNK> at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 2823.1113977687965
CHAPTER XV . 158.33268212522805
Miss Bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . 1611.6800066747564
what does he say ? 367.8506245278803
With <UNK> tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of <UNK> that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . 3746.3024971070686
" His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . 1344.1075755395518
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 3855.9378216122054
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . 3074.8155983814127
She will be taken good care of . 772.1058680795974
" I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . 3234.6534203380293
<UNK> as she was to admit an idea so <UNK> of Jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the <UNK> of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . 3504.5398928141785
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . " Hunsford , near <UNK> , Kent , th <UNK> . DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . " There , Mrs . 5879.7498786690685
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? 1741.0597103339373
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . 2107.045799065556
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . 2438.384665500833
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild <UNK> , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character . 3300.5962954657402
" A <UNK> ! " she cried . 773.1877281157019
How well it <UNK> . 367.9661777992956
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . 3375.7147004543626
Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . 1341.497263486196
Her colour changed , and she said no more . 1057.0474684196151
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 4530.249162885561
" I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five <UNK> any object . 4236.709122743257
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 2635.5992075008294
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must <UNK> him from such <UNK> misconduct as I have suffered by . 3629.925343820066
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . 1746.3707046117718
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , <UNK> my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " " It is well . 4012.4549716824536
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 1741.7709556669745
" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . 2737.1571220216338
Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 4006.9526182651116
here comes Hill . 254.2520499294883
<UNK> of business too ! 367.78111956580926
Philips . The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . 1741.1893238652444
Georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . 4230.68151300422
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 4058.015055698961
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with . 4999.732359923996
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 1868.8072952976067
" I expected at least that the <UNK> were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! " " La ! 3158.082586918478
To <UNK> <UNK> or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www . gutenberg . org donate While we cannot and do not solicit <UNK> from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no <UNK> against accepting <UNK> donations from <UNK> in such states who approach us with offers to donate . 4686.477321008099
" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs . 1746.1813814614613
It was to this effect " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well . 3858.404729487591
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself <UNK> watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . 3372.4443375053293
Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 3152.3304922717593
The <UNK> was <UNK> to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so <UNK> a <UNK> . 2223.564790298243
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . 4562.770555385108
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . 2332.6095526203876
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 2110.0017487745936
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . 1612.292554431688
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . 1476.7501626662886
Their manners are not equal to his . " " Certainly not ; at first . 1867.5470664339045
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . " " But my father cannot . He wrote last week to hurry my return . " " Oh ! 3155.192336174833
He was on one side of her mother . 914.9012853347961
I am sure you will be very comfortable there . 1060.9977063711183
" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . 1060.3716555427022
How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! 1741.2927610157844
They must be a great loss to your family . " In Darcy ' s presence she dared not mention Wickham ' s name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <UNK> in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , <UNK> herself <UNK> to <UNK> the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . 5039.347211262143
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <UNK> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . 5394.015728888916
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 5365.603045994585
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did . 4193.856265725718
Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . " In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . 4273.749028214985
Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . 2224.2485309408435
She felt <UNK> the justice of Mr . Darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 3443.308246379474
Her ease and good spirits increased . 629.8875639829727
The other is Miss De Bourgh . 631.1682978177058
" Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss Bingley ; " and pray what is the result ? " " I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect . 3964.038454930768
<UNK> the Foundation as set forth in Section below . 1056.2276180211038
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 1058.703651095965
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " " Are you , indeed ? 2226.5787432117118
Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> . 3857.212165217186
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard . 1868.0194245093408
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . 1056.856469785894
A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . 1611.2363671514347
Here , <UNK> , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . 2220.589512015829
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you . 4189.019610888718
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . 1057.427633351125
Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . 3228.7870892805363
You must contrive to send somebody . 630.3377226797566
Philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly <UNK> the invitation . 1610.9705532709104
Collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too . 3688.872018324634
Elizabeth , <UNK> all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . 4772.886414039979
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . 3860.7012035464845
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . 3371.8134809273315
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 2642.3233194504364
" Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . 4804.210295655336
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs . 3511.217403849912
It would be such a <UNK> scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . 2332.816119981197
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 2913.1859346550423
" I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . 3307.838168737214
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . 1870.585840707709
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . 2636.819543553789
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission . 2909.3397771961977
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . 4008.114958314457
I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . 1615.92919260677
Jane <UNK> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour . 4496.376827566286
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . 1867.40183276624
what hours of <UNK> we shall spend ! 769.7271990783833
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 3959.628934067142
I am not qualified to form one . 773.6929341445053
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . 2110.133333448539
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 2110.1850955411173
" I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could . 2827.45881232523
" He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . 2441.9830439841944
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 3076.148681388329
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . 3152.046432940989
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . 2107.0457663884977
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . " " If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . 4658.533988245277
Mr . Darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . 1342.6722050473998
Make haste , and come down this moment . " Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . 4562.241062968766
Lydia laughed , and said , " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . 2107.3577414712367
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest . 3801.969463062782
" While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr . Bingley . " " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife . 3636.3538448622107
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . 1741.8864587667329
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 3690.6251502335617
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 4686.059242824996
The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . 4427.115578904514
CHAPTER XVII . 158.33268212522805
The particulars , I reserve till we meet . 914.9889913960826
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two . 3300.9296258225927
" I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham . 3378.053148054289
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned . 4594.599174568221
Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for . 1479.243066448138
Yours ever , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " With the officers ! " cried Lydia . 1989.0704456927203
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! 5624.27497243678
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . 3371.2728444958284
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <UNK> satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 3689.263997963073
He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these <UNK> had arisen his principal <UNK> . 2333.0329614221114
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 3073.648841376968
Your <UNK> must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance . 3300.689426883225
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 2992.3485237028053
CHAPTER IV . 158.31985829036464
" If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . 4060.0934607173062
Then pray speak aloud . 367.81008746800734
Her father <UNK> by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and <UNK> mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . 4272.5288800121525
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget ' had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ' Those were your words . 3074.0295348118775
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . 4660.13136108927
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . 2637.9046455778594
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 1873.0572615914602
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . 1058.703651095965
Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . 1058.9491215942974
See paragraph . E below . 494.2163744472452
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day <UNK> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . 4233.360869475526
To the civil enquiries which then <UNK> in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer . 3747.1861392560695
Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . 1611.6911464055277
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . 2540.5793601266882
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 2106.9236687314324
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of <UNK> to others . 2821.9334556642293
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 4998.653326374866
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . 1339.4983318530253
Yes , I call it a very easy distance . " " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth . 3372.5658867871944
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to <UNK> the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 3230.424212731704
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 3749.113613052137
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . " " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . 4772.63292112076
Will you come and see me ? " " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . " " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . 3440.67384194949
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . 913.4276962056133
" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the <UNK> that is laid on them , as nonsense ? 2440.9328234511686
But it was not to be . 631.4025488656315
Those who do not complain are never pitied . " Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or <UNK> her would only increase the irritation . 3567.811959791905
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . 2821.020451239649
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 2638.9528661197974
CHAPTER <UNK> . 158.31344539901033
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . 3804.805948294758
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . 1990.1801706203103
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 5232.62752892223
Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . " CHAPTER XIII . 2435.8071274693084
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better . 915.0781380945772
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . 5674.446831781772
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 3073.9207212429687
Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ' s <UNK> enough to <UNK> him from its <UNK> , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never <UNK> without him . " " So much the better . 4659.293304517604
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! 1741.848110487465
Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! Yes certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . " And <UNK> her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma ' am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr . Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . 5379.322640475473
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . " " I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 5632.718818857623
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . 4149.728706917368
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! 1343.8406147707997
For , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken <UNK> , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the <UNK> reproof . 3073.716737185914
The possibility of Mr . Collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins ! 5142.955889815195
You mentioned two instances . 368.46576505708504
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . 1198.9403280899337
Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> . 3857.025889405947
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! 1870.5707538746124
At length the Parsonage was <UNK> . 629.6868284329387
" This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! 2735.0027857003047
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some <UNK> , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings . 4102.644294772587
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . 3230.2766978603718
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <UNK> , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room . 3689.050746373673
But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . " " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . " Elizabeth made no answer . 4998.297197011069
Illustration <UNK> PRIDE AND PREJUDICE A Novel . 769.7090398014706
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . " " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? " " Dearest Jane ! 4189.018874580782
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 4596.955585497452
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so . 1870.2507207528613
You will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . " He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit <UNK> long . 4595.682225390634
I know no harm of her . " " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her <UNK> ' s death made her mistress of this fortune . " " No why should he ? 3751.290716372815
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . " " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 4877.728354566011
Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the <UNK> and smiles of the whole party . 3858.439615561649
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 1058.7143707886908
For God ' s sake , say no more of his partners . 1476.9593323950912
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . 2106.9779603947723
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . 2638.4964284942744
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? 4351.119433595873
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels . 2107.829074195526
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " " Ten thousand pounds ! 2825.8556536572178
<UNK> may sometimes be purchased too dearly . 769.6635803729071
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 4351.041759518538
" From what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs . 1481.4582197347886
Their reception at home was most kind . 769.9541291136757
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I <UNK> believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . 4715.995817773595
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that <UNK> is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . 5061.96011575665
Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs . 2220.9450492262204
Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . 1868.0741274179047
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 1741.1893881563772
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . 3375.9537240347954
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . 1057.0370764380898
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " " You have . 4351.469042835641
Her ladyship ' s carriage is <UNK> ordered for us . 1199.6049196017389
His surprise was great . 368.2080598066502
Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs . 3300.6898861426525
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . 2824.0868613418816
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <UNK> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <UNK> . 4057.0080026818196
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company . 3441.8233939827333
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our <UNK> ! 4878.670706116163
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half expectation which Mrs . 2538.328248387391
" I did not know that you intended to walk , " said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . 2914.60509649082
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to <UNK> as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was . 3959.210931773492
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 5143.65966014485
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she <UNK> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . 4745.342692290053
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 3505.036651253217
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
" And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 3752.129872665565
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . " " <UNK> their income ! 2220.5894364236965
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . 2911.20819407944
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . 3230.7689710650384
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . 1614.1354679434298
I ought not to have said a word about it . 1203.04103566822
Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . 2110.282019242481
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 1989.5926728040752
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 2335.3192524297133
" And may I ask ? " said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . " " <UNK> with ! 3079.6817688452647
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . 3300.436017066565
Their fortune on both sides is splendid . 769.9450338602585
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . 1745.9802992967238
only think ! 158.16019018886195
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 1477.2781854967163
" Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 5022.388126009324
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 2825.5380367827083
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . 1056.8671692586577
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its <UNK> , to think of any thing else . 4529.85445112696
Mr . Bennet ' s <UNK> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! 4878.745307998193
it is just as he <UNK> . 629.338824615813
But who was your mother ? 495.85179950945707

Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 2994.0339377763125
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not . 3507.5751956104236
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 3806.8364269791027
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 3228.3813454861465
I am glad he <UNK> here on Tuesday . 916.9843828988243
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted , is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK> their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and <UNK> them earnestly . But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . 6430.672552850951
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , <UNK> love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means <UNK> , though it could not be exactly defined . 4594.473143435488
But Georgiana would not join her . 631.2073908283422
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> ! 2442.1459515814936
how shall I bear so much happiness ! " She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty . 3504.553169544956
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 2992.416885672176
They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . 2822.7193729527476
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 2221.6391675440605
" Oh ! 159.45205162549917
My father , however , is partial to Mr . Wickham . 1340.1482581717062
" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your <UNK> appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . " " Oh ! 5063.729297373305
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 1870.1339921558588
Bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . 914.441675565495
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . 3689.239077007921
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . " " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . 4352.866057305701
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . " However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather <UNK> , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . 4495.277107005739
no . I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . " " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may <UNK> our different opinions . " " No I cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . " " The present always <UNK> you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt . 5408.736084936749
There is nothing else to be done . 770.325911488502
It would have suited me in every respect . " " How should you have liked making sermons ? " " <UNK> well . 2732.276333362173
Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately . 912.6647652804972
The pain of separation , however , might be <UNK> on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . 4463.067508735865
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 3073.5399085391027
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 2441.065038973811
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 4994.98240494614
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and <UNK> the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 5348.3572783412965
was not a man to be trusted . 769.7181387121519
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . 1867.4415359832167
But now it was all too natural . 771.8857153009143
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . 1744.6754638233815
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference . 1339.6047003431158
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . 1867.6257144653787
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself . 2638.98055043561
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs . 1611.4010431423383
" Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " I have , Sir . " " Very well . 2735.445250680941
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 2537.723751725172
" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . 1746.9588489345872
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 5609.59980609198
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . 3073.7713035816787
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 3907.8439768839785
When they repaired to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 3689.4304594029495
" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her . 2112.479186563094
Not all that Mrs . 367.89689658390074
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . " " No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me . 4391.3936287282095
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs . 3855.3685505929793
She turned from sister to sister , <UNK> their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . 4463.383247545342
" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . 3962.9042969553134
Oh , Lord ! 254.36907979213925
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 1994.5521833904938
where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without <UNK> a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . 4562.516405965897
She performed her part indeed without much <UNK> , but Mrs . 1342.2571417822737
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design . 3855.194764596622
I will think no more about him . " Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth . 4104.908954893642
He was full of joy and attention . 771.6797069196145
nonsense , how can you talk so ! 769.7272299965581
But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . 2439.2077241972847
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . 2821.0340230003267

Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 1198.9630160815823
Gardiner . 84.10084178660469
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . 4927.577188774358
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 3855.653647526176
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? " " Yes ; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . 3568.4727126329562
" I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . 2642.5724445322935
For your sake , " turning to Charlotte , " I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for <UNK> estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh ' s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? " " A little . " " Oh ! 4716.271458167489
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private <UNK> in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of <UNK> with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . 4745.038815159479
By nature <UNK> , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James ' s had made him <UNK> . 2435.9865233793685
Oh , brother , how kind you are ! 912.9630850168693
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy ! 1477.2052822252417
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had <UNK> <UNK> only four months ago , would now have been <UNK> and gratefully received ! 3629.5811604560986
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 3074.4486490993636
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . 2437.246136670651
You do not look well . 495.0372808321369
I always had a value for him . 773.0741760067021
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane . 1198.8837855658994
She does not yet leave her dressing room . 915.2878282860509
<UNK> , of course . If you mention my name at the <UNK> , you will be attended to . " Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . 4971.987258214085
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 2333.61012944402
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 3691.597438910902
That his anger could be carried to such a point of <UNK> resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem <UNK> , exceeded all that she could believe possible . 3801.568389812769
how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would <UNK> you about to all the balls . 2729.7498906427236
You are so strange ! 368.52376742240375
Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active <UNK> , and when immediately before my father ' s death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . " " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth . 5062.4598362358765
I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! 3157.0641292930827
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all <UNK> , was still <UNK> <UNK> . 2821.3608805024314
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew . 1203.143217921551
Bennet , having <UNK> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . 4627.692750378231
On both sides it was only assertion . 769.9540944355297
They <UNK> as expeditiously as possible ; and <UNK> one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day . 2731.0377042231366
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house . 1610.9325312854178
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! 1990.1130262604904
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . 4529.684219156386
have you heard from my uncle ? " " Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . " " Well , and what news does it bring ? 3371.6315421470817
" I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel <UNK> ' s regiment went away . 2828.6998801562218
You see how continually we are engaged there . 913.8506085057882
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled . " A gentleman and a stranger ! 1478.8989778934883
do any thing rather than marry without affection . 912.7344347815194
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her . 1343.6027759890683
Dear , dear Lizzy . 367.81008746800734
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . 1339.4272903390565
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . 3507.9452301207307
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . 1057.427633351125
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . 1056.302487199555
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
He was well , but so much engaged with Mr . Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . 2334.0496426523646
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ' s . 1989.1107352868921
Bennet . 84.29501402535595
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . " " Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . 4532.22244512207
Elizabeth was delighted . 254.82540804621192
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 1872.4608586228771
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . 3441.2178239852383
I have not the smallest hope . 632.625715614869
" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the <UNK> <UNK> above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <UNK> than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . 5623.154705992573
I am the happiest creature in the world . 917.0643733641853
Your ' s , c . 494.4683323421987
Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 1869.8427457651085
No , never . 254.36008082411044
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 4686.722255009525
My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his <UNK> in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . 4972.596796879633
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . 1479.9939084126559
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . 2541.6019000225997
Forster . 84.00792367457534
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 4352.875810465741
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . 3074.46461154433
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that . 1615.7134660836516
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 3506.058627567877
I am impatient to see him . " " In point of <UNK> , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective . 2914.1182170092948
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . " " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth <UNK> ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy ' s steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself . " " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a <UNK> . 5556.034955592223
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 4147.961697723811
Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age . 3441.3464081597845
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . 1744.4428581065783
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . 2826.699615071613
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . 4009.0261382891795
Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a <UNK> to buy clothes for his daughter . 2637.321239385264
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might <UNK> to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . 4460.915251094335
Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . " " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget . 4744.293986574603
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <UNK> of my son in law . 3567.7600939079616
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 3505.4654771124433
I was uncomfortable enough . 370.04300230882035
It is highly improper . 369.11917449832197
I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . 3233.1836250731417
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . 2537.5165459860386
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 2223.7610366290705
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly <UNK> , she seated herself . 3629.7611978410428
I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too . 1615.7134948252208
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . 3801.8567301887697
I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . " " I desire you will do no such thing . 4803.383011781404
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in <UNK> ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs . 4531.978425136876
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . 4715.421854373938
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest <UNK> ; his <UNK> contracted , his air gloomy . 2994.84705930537
Nor was Darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 2435.7656995912585
A lively imagination soon settled it all . 769.9993797278827
Gardiner , though unknown . 368.23184566630124
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . 2331.8849067474657
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you ! 1745.7982159194
Shall you like to have such a brother ? " " Very , very much . 1867.110995758562
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . 2437.5074755108094
Lady Catherine was <UNK> proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her . 2635.847663180941
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not <UNK> , but haughty . 2539.904529732991
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach . 2729.998068491231
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage . 2542.8933210330483
It cannot last long . 368.85856986577426
It adds even another motive . 495.4490153042436
III . 83.98610986891775
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long <UNK> . " Mrs . 3439.0755985252717
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and <UNK> heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 4102.081649385225
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . 3228.1958431995677
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . 3504.4748143738734
Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs . 5785.757562590177
Adieu to disappointment and <UNK> . 494.1883504968256
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you . 1744.0246138255652
I quite detest the man . " CHAPTER IV . 1060.216693226575
It originated in Mrs . 368.84114375081424
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 367.9779344871137
CHAPTER XIV . 158.33268212522805
Bingley and talked of Mrs . 494.32832646883736
You must not disappoint your father . " " My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . " " Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . " " Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . 4233.288243509394
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . " " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth . 4598.711441960648
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . 3572.7858685781375
Every thing , however , went on <UNK> , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ' s first sketch . 2435.944979182172
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 769.6999538881013
" Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . 1872.1827355768366
Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their <UNK> their income . 2637.5841827273134
and what can he have to say ? " " Something very much to the purpose of course . 2220.7810205585297
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest <UNK> , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any <UNK> display of regard , or any <UNK> of manner , where their two <UNK> only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 4950.430108120073
She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . 3507.9172608513563
Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ? 2729.6532503719286
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . 2333.7460136480267
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way . 2330.6429714607116
<UNK> the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it cannot be long . " He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . 4876.208501823233
She will not be able to help calling . " " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 5041.156202790906
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . 2993.315116629863
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 2994.7403186665856
Bennet ' s civilities . 368.8158620522894
Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " Lord , how tired I am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn . 3568.083959379198
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time . 2908.0107905198993
" How could you begin ? " said she . 1060.511139217797
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon . 2995.5007204195413
But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he <UNK> that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 5084.367126841021
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . 2331.134887591266
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . 4006.843920629616
It was first broken by Mrs . 631.3561160111904
" Of a fine , stout , <UNK> love it may . 1343.679369938252
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 1741.1116343157678
my sweetest Lizzy ! 254.30157619729704
Where shall you change horses ? Oh ! 769.7181374234376
Collins , did I tell you of Lady <UNK> ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? 1989.5128156213823
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . 1345.556413385848
Every <UNK> <UNK> in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther <UNK> of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago <UNK> his <UNK> in the affair ; that proud and <UNK> as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had <UNK> brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be <UNK> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <UNK> or <UNK> habits . 5576.17402204838
Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and <UNK> passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . 4626.3653541686035
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 1339.2376636864255
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her . 3305.73728187739
Elizabeth now began to <UNK> . 494.95352458201967
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . 770.7470145653147
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 2537.627073125047
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 1741.7195050329256
If you are outside the United States , check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before <UNK> , copying , displaying , performing , distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg tm work . 4231.877883601601
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . 2996.3756145215116
They must all go to Brighton . 630.208506782976
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . " " To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 4189.726004412306
" But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing . 2441.34783257426
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . 770.7293757913924
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and <UNK> in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . 3632.40298162673
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in <UNK> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " said Jane as she finished it . 4626.002954989695
The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . 3748.722040245751
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid . 3691.3509965161297
My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . 4530.484889737443
Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 2539.4458124300468
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . " " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . " Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . 4798.731357595737
He studies too much for words of four <UNK> . Do not you , Darcy ? " " My style of writing is very different from yours . " " Oh ! " cried Miss Bingley , " Charles <UNK> in the most careless way imaginable . 4191.482192460516
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon <UNK> deliberation , you find that the misery of <UNK> his two sisters is more than <UNK> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . " " How can you talk so ? " said Jane <UNK> smiling , " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . " " I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . " " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 6087.498696874194
There is a <UNK> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . 2221.435714584763
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ? 1476.7255405197404
I had not believed it possible . " " I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth . 2113.6213839472866
Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . 2908.6280393735587
Have not you always hated him ? " How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! 3073.6624396868383
Not a soul knew of it , but <UNK> . 1056.441344804186
" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . " " It is no such thing . 2543.343161424347
As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner ' s hope of Lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its <UNK> . 3505.296672307129
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 3571.8479765525044
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 3907.537405766139
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 3440.9918678448157
She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece . 2638.9805386616636
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . 2112.3640666808415
You have done all this ! 495.0723200144997
It is a pity they are not handsome ! 915.0320670852464
They have at least that advantage . " " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . 3153.7820591110926
Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 1870.292191510981
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " My eldest sister has been in town these three months . 3231.1884582322473
But there was still something <UNK> behind , of which prudence <UNK> the <UNK> . 1743.9595382843565
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> . 3632.775214260175
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 3861.161452058906
He was very fond of them . " This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham ' s being among them . 2540.706773892857
It is admirable ! " Elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 2823.6502784980016
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <UNK> , readily obeyed . 2436.275560671652
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was <UNK> her feelings in <UNK> on Elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . 4100.644004432227
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 2638.897155037283
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 3443.7865556875677
It was a large , well <UNK> room , handsomely fitted up . 1479.9223179271764
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or <UNK> distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more <UNK> blind . 4311.595818665391
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . 2220.6579562815364
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . 1870.3037162463506
There was also a postscript to this effect . 913.3698005364473
Bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . 3506.5461252711143
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . 2335.181366300393
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . " Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . 4719.6898423437015
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the <UNK> kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . 3507.9145029218976
He had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . 3373.5515588897174
Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party . 2538.316069516791
It was a large , handsome , <UNK> building , standing well on rising ground , and <UNK> by a <UNK> of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was <UNK> into greater , but without any <UNK> appearance . 4191.36473944832
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two . 1869.5704118934204
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child . 770.0630877439601
" Your affectionate friend , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " Oh ! 1482.074641664544
This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . 2436.2204086557927
But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . 2223.7951378910107
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! 1611.1223403400286
" Not yet , " replied Jane . 773.2242604165206
Bennet , " I am quite delighted with him . 1058.521633991149
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . 3749.2780879681018
<UNK> such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not <UNK> the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . 4743.933283495323
Yet he knew to the contrary himself . 769.7544967650632
Without a governess you must have been neglected . " " <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . 3567.7600939079803
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 2221.5714237900042
Many small donations to , are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the <UNK> . 1989.1107257712004
F . 83.99007840409676
<UNK> that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . 2435.7104596016516
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them . " This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret . 5038.640506084807
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
I do not trust my own partiality . 773.3296240777032
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . 2821.9748450575435
He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . 2109.7562636304383
Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 2993.3990306555165
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . " Mrs . 2110.6062235193212
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 2907.942078145057
They were within twenty <UNK> of each other , and so <UNK> was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . 2822.360792926488
Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him . 2107.032222695771
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . 3229.0330155986617
" What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? " " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . " " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . 4691.2283337799845
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . 4145.94636007883
yes , " said Elizabeth drily " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a <UNK> deal of care of him . " " <UNK> of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care . 4461.699600638475
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . 3227.9943462886863
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . 2330.2722532852426
Jenkinson to make up her party . 629.3712485792857
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 1995.0497911905159
This will never do . " " You need not distress yourself . 1477.671651972146
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . 1341.9723998319685
You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . 2332.37944814772
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . " Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . 2908.3266936652244
She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most <UNK> by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . 3911.515378286542
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 4148.072931664591
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 2110.0653818997084
<UNK> , selfish girl ! 367.78111956580926
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? " " Most willingly . " " You shall have it in few words . 4007.8569936921635
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . 1057.5767974433954
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 1056.3666595897587
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . " " Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . 4100.514142344835
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 769.872550722836
But I know the foundation is unjust . 772.1313122893007
I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a <UNK> up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 3157.131846585644
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of <UNK> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . 4058.6166684406794
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . 4233.349358662188
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . 1743.9011821335612
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . " " But not before they went to Brighton ? " " No , I believe not . " " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? 4354.813505572405
Jane now came up . 367.98354214033276
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . 2437.315013305564
After a short silence , the lady first spoke . 1056.6761202245111
" Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . " She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . 4775.717986557963
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 2641.0389773521424
It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be <UNK> , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham . 3909.5167095713464
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had . 4056.3016949238995
CHAPTER XIX . 158.33268212522805
Hurst was observing their game . 494.3352971384575
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 1478.130952120418
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise . 5517.594508775075
" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . 1994.6731114202903
Let me mend it for you . 629.5251718883268
It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . 3442.5729354610858
Bennet was restored to her usual <UNK> serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the <UNK> office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton . 5233.947664082651
The visit was returned in due form . 771.7871973082291
All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . 4006.892143661998
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
But think no more of the letter . 771.8583691642397
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . 3507.381495532538
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . " " In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . 4007.819615746032
I have by no means done . 632.5360727826029
I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . " Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . 4775.7041113470195
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 2220.644254465517
" I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends . 2737.266337344509
If your feelings are still what they were last <UNK> , tell me so at once . 1989.8727395436933
On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . 2537.9585080084607
Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him . 2908.1206305372707
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 4353.1204728686425
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <UNK> him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 4145.7947449841395
His character was to speak for itself . 770.3699797069554
They were ignorant , idle , and vain . 914.030444392944
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 4565.683227023959
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week . 4057.536763902562
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . 3629.8126604558242
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . 2436.1660186215436
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals . 3078.2567741851885
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . 2908.968381598875
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , Mrs . 1989.2583312941845
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 1992.2223964942386
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . " " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the <UNK> manner which I see so many women ' s do . 4355.5566027554505
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . 1200.2342092206256
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances and to have Mr . Collins instead ! 2334.185996882787
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr . Darcy ' s steward . 5333.849088680618
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 629.355059943074
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . " " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . " " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . " " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . " " But consider your daughters . 5161.432113872047
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 4995.679548912098
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . 2435.848493467537
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <UNK> shewn . 3958.668291330513
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 1203.7430783189188
" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . 2736.396181069658
She is almost three and twenty ! 631.5419897995225
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . 3375.821019042291
Why must their marriage be private ? 629.3955495661177
Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley <UNK> with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . 3747.468068962974
We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation . 2436.3995316106734
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so <UNK> ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . 5365.447170471212
You are not going to be <UNK> , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . 2437.493681860238
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . " " Oh ! 2998.542147504741
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr . Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . 4825.787202278991
The officers will find women better worth their notice . 1058.7250890705943
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good <UNK> engaged Mr . Collins ' s conversation to herself . 3155.95036246826
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . 3748.333270287629
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " Lydia declared herself satisfied . 2223.91847304111
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . 4234.1672135993895
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 3152.37070818974
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 4191.926126896304
Mr . Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . 2824.085825288169
But what is that to me ? 631.2155250490399
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . 2223.567672293625
She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband . 1058.9818267462203
I quite forgot ! 255.91670428712268
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . 915.0469222607978
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . 2820.4972986781117
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 4800.873735677088
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <UNK> , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 3858.378116946983
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away . 3372.8688515234353
Bennet , who <UNK> with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be <UNK> enough . 4056.890301294145
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell <UNK> to mend a great <UNK> in my worked muslin gown , before they are <UNK> up . 3633.9490073908805
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . 2333.115653500904
While these <UNK> born notions were passing in their <UNK> , the perturbation of Elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . 2635.3364208612793
They are wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? " " They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . " " But if you have got them to day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered . " She did at last <UNK> from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . 4997.078775464072
But I will not repine . 496.1044065200296
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with <UNK> all the <UNK> explanations . 2539.7550289248616
Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 5061.483390911891
What are we to do ! " would they often <UNK> in the bitterness of <UNK> . 1989.5391633523975
She directly replied , " You need not be frightened . 1201.744547482517
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . 1743.4452767007638
How was that possible ? 367.97777084529787
" She is my youngest girl but one . 916.5515386869013
Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c . 2911.285479458813
Mr . Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . 2911.450501572555
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 2911.79452528792
<UNK> felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . 4351.781244424457
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . 2439.348156379381
The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . 2911.1350508171813
<UNK> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all . 4056.100002750047
Lydia ' s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , <UNK> engaged with one of the <UNK> <UNK> in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little <UNK> , of his house and garden at Hunsford . 5528.139009177952
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . 2908.024519558798
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being <UNK> by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . 4798.70174178287
I will read it to you " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles <UNK> to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <UNK> <UNK> . 5350.93666962134
Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley . 3373.5351530355115
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . 2821.7472494348312
" I hope , " added Mrs . 773.8332957893498
Mr . Wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a <UNK> as she could . 3508.452660952988
CHAPTER IX . 158.33268212522805
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . " " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request . 3154.3765665097217
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . 3960.5179985378777
When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . 3074.530357557358
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . 3746.024647082793
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 4529.663209811137
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . 2336.088165945987
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
The <UNK> letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 3507.3291533906354
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and <UNK> every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the <UNK> of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 4425.031688437604
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
They were natural and just . 495.1148024823739
She is unfortunately of a sickly <UNK> , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who <UNK> her education , and who still <UNK> with them . 4191.59597031199
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 3230.2096114792253
Two <UNK> , however , were plainly <UNK> from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been <UNK> used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 4495.374213390555
In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 3505.5687928953935
Bennet , alarmed . 255.11525666452022
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . 1867.534031804405
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 2820.703970606203
Though our kind uncle has done something towards <UNK> him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . 3152.0599075801356
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to <UNK> this estate after the death of your honoured father , who , however , may live many years longer , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . 5234.678643535961
" Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared . 1615.668337082506
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening . 3374.7420761091894
The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood . 1992.1239832946492
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . 2437.774626766961
<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 494.167333080278
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? 1199.1667174252473
Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton . 2436.027785126694
They followed her into the dining parlour . 770.7113081488588
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that <UNK> is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . 4311.595813866058
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <UNK> ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . 4462.008139809454
A fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . 1056.6012035404915
Every thing being settled between them , Mr . Darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home . 3689.776199645695
Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . 3373.442278068742
I shall go distracted . " This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . 3634.155055930294
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last <UNK> , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were <UNK> answered . 3632.130826467762
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 2109.5932300220143
" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . 4317.03607081656
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 916.3773255622111
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . " Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs . 3509.5936400847118
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to <UNK> , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to <UNK> his prosperous love . 4901.4664428773385
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her <UNK> spirits , and of teaching her that her present <UNK> are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 4145.94750414942
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . 1870.1870068761968
Jenkinson , who lives with them . 629.3712485792857
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach . 3689.3150266275193
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 1479.9444016849864
There was no help for it however . 770.316810553972
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? " " Oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all . 3227.9137103040284
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please . 2825.8279868432564
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified . 1741.2803662289991
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ' s <UNK> , and complimented her on bearing it so well . 2330.833682665647
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse . 912.7145115415204
Mr . what ' s his name . 771.759322198612
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 1477.682972408537
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage . 4627.9944157028685
She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs . 915.4075076785606
" Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair . 1482.309087162925
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 1744.3517736071394
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . 1340.13585821027
They walked on , without knowing in what direction . 1057.4277977365145
Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! 2437.3786877718394
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the <UNK> . " This was not very consoling to Mrs . 2330.423374358866
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed ! 1339.9108713394298
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 769.8544304224552
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . 2820.5386572346983
She had even learnt to <UNK> , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a <UNK> to disgust and weary . 2996.2385928741555
Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . 1741.539928153177
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever . " Darcy was fixed in astonishment . 2996.0341957753853
Are not you curious to hear how it was <UNK> ? " " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . " " La ! 3688.9361252006242
However , if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg tm work in a format other than " Plain Vanilla ASCII " or other format used in the official <UNK> posted on the official Project Gutenberg tm web site www . gutenberg . org , you must , at no additional cost , fee or expense to the user , provide a copy , a means of <UNK> a copy , or a means of obtaining a copy upon request , of the work in its original " Plain Vanilla ASCII " or other form . 5463.126262353331
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its <UNK> was visiting and news . 2223.6744387708213
" She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . " Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . 5270.649360892107
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 5216.158679320308
With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . 3568.2005973315754
With them he is remarkably agreeable . " " I do not believe a word of it , my dear . 2437.9383210877813
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 3505.4256595271568
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . 1612.191256529758
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 3228.2088500978416
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling . " " Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose . 3076.546432423412
" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? " " To morrow fortnight . " " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . 3509.782813171818
" You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried . 1344.1908266476048
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 4878.438674715024
That such a consequence as this should <UNK> , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . " " When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . " " Not the slightest . 4425.207980045708
<UNK> , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . 1476.7624608030937
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing room . 2732.9890068551285
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 2330.1757957433742
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . 1478.0949397513127
" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said Mr . Gardiner . 1994.5790077793256
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . 1058.7465214034821
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is <UNK> . " " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs . 2993.3592129604185
I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . 2440.871326978057
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . " " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . 3157.178799720296
Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . 2438.9884185046994
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . 3689.1771371201808
She answered him with cold civility . 631.4363331729807
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <UNK> . 4190.23343704018
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 1056.3665959698167
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a <UNK> profit c <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under the laws of the state of <UNK> and <UNK> tax exempt status by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . 3907.820351075692
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . " " Not as you represent it . 2330.794255464563
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . 1339.6756829214132
Its banks were neither formal , nor <UNK> adorned . 1056.2596961512577
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . 3747.8635257337583
A house in town ! 367.99508255852095
Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 3227.8195617955425
Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 1990.1550916183535
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . 1610.7425282863019
It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . 1869.4644564570187
He is so excessively handsome ! 495.57397124230437
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr . Bennet , have you no more <UNK> <UNK> in which Lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " " I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs . 5061.548742113665
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 4103.9558848387505
He <UNK> , and <UNK> , and makes love to us all . 1478.9254559075105
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 2221.3410840555953
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . 4352.909502045729
Whatever bears affinity to <UNK> is <UNK> . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 2820.455913370698
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 2221.2311178002974
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . 912.7742332014935
Let me never see either one or the other again ! " Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no <UNK> , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re <UNK> the admiration of her former lover . 4350.528604534778
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a <UNK> , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , <UNK> to Kitty and Lydia . 4460.469457292868
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . 3907.353171430088
and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! 769.8089842922265
Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <UNK> . 4562.781257283275
CHAPTER XIII . 158.31985829036464
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . 2107.181292889069
yes . 83.99999634491505
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . " As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . 5140.411987875725
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . " " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were <UNK> and insolent . 5519.528372852391
She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 2995.8013562134397
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much . 1342.3973467206333
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <UNK> by Wickham . 3442.7017598898838
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the <UNK> of red <UNK> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 3688.426314566473
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle . 2112.234564515915
<UNK> Lady Catherine as well as you can . 912.6647652804965
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 2439.5554840728432
Your <UNK> are by no means unlike . 769.8905249500123
They were hopeless of remedy . 495.1148024823739
" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " His misfortunes ! " repeated Darcy <UNK> ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . " " And of your <UNK> , " cried Elizabeth with energy . 4355.101870906554
Collins knew not what to make of him . 913.0026628382803
A clergyman like you must marry . <UNK> properly , chuse a <UNK> for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . 4311.844004523912
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " Oh ! 3229.0733958705937
<UNK> spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother in law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . 4311.516620740842
We do not suffer by accident . 629.6380905879264
At present I will say nothing about it . " " You are quite right . 1868.6569025364058
Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 3075.9015387066556
Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 2992.594459672619
Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority . 3300.8363189612296
What is to become of us ! 629.6301059610156
Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go . 3154.5979310512366
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 2732.919119029413
<UNK> on Jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy ' s explanation , by <UNK> Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 3802.3316898908056
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . 1613.866698708846
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs . 1201.1349358745579
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 2537.5026564687696
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . 1200.566247118325
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . 2635.488629486357
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . 1339.2969820965181
She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . 3077.098233214735
CHAPTER I . 158.33268212522805
After playing some <UNK> <UNK> , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to <UNK> such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " She smiled , but made no answer . 4716.299990586387
They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . 1742.5041716396308
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . 3569.039507809599
I hope they will not meet at all . 916.4272671047297
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 1741.7707328930774
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 2223.729266977758
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . 1057.0164133048518
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 3229.3424339246267
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 3374.8476599366754
Thank God ! 158.1665955100683
To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough . 1867.6524651228347
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . 2541.0496083372964
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 4995.009229840345
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 3302.3158830033294
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 3157.091173431695
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> . 1867.1109901306222
Philips ' s manners and politeness . 629.4927492196712
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 3440.592994525878
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 3228.408155629379
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 1867.4283002122797
She has a very good notion of <UNK> , though her taste is not equal to Anne ' s . 2333.7184203665606
Miss Darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . 1199.302098056268
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . 2729.6532464551947
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . 4351.164474936164
Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . 1868.1138431151617
Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . 2332.8238001075288
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 1868.7811502393706
A great deal more passed at the other table . 1056.6226004584425
He is a pleasant fellow , and would <UNK> you <UNK> . " " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 3076.257600513897
" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam . 5566.524323804687
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else ! 1994.5522481668322
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . 4427.623018974513
Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very <UNK> too for it is provoking me to <UNK> , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly . 4974.546514440142
You are not well enough ; you cannot go yourself . " Elizabeth hesitated , but her <UNK> <UNK> under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . 3689.9961586868753
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . 1990.059697972491
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . 5302.489964677861
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity . 3370.7696504760484
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 3440.4960321336976
" Oh ! " said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . 2827.03401823281
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . " Elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . 2731.6033557428473
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . 1060.8581237311346
In this <UNK> state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 4949.524048272872
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 1614.0825590788718
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <UNK> what <UNK> felicity really was . 1992.228949358508
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the <UNK> of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . 3629.735094860803
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . 3300.9960100859416
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! 1477.0819203954768
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . 2641.717088493541
I hate such false friends . 496.7821680141026
Other schemes too came into her head . 769.6999538881013
You provide , in accordance with paragraph . F . , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and <UNK> to you within days of receipt of the work . 4189.859257457058
Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar . 3855.691121575159
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy . 915.6363697062413
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very <UNK> reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to <UNK> and <UNK> to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 5872.58925634074
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . " <UNK> by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did . 4715.543061643941
Bennet by admiring Mrs . 368.67658110574666
I shall <UNK> it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . " And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh ! 4058.9400138548317
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter . 3632.493082139851
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 4351.288469472913
CHAPTER XIX . 158.33268212522805
Is this to be endured ! 494.2653809820498
" I am all astonishment . 497.4732164140284
Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 2995.5683330496117
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . 1344.066285304898
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " cried Elizabeth . 3229.1345027402667
My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . 4351.221033879429
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well . 2107.600286675276
<UNK> those who are at all his <UNK> in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . 2907.8871113611544
" He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . 3806.393369257235
Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt . 2222.7309683633453
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> . 2540.6182258794215
my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " Oh , lord ! 2436.428383675098
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 2436.0692526142266
Indeed he has no improper pride . 629.3226161396262
His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . 2909.0093570575077
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . 1867.6784342383155
mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to day ? 1610.6917822529604
One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! 2537.7239532679755
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 4353.224813833617
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . 1339.9939764225628
Bennet could hardly contain herself . 495.2781448867766
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 1990.0203720422949
<UNK> wore a happier aspect . 494.167333080278
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 1741.5137568032421
" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s <UNK> in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . 4534.111587837839
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper <UNK> . 1867.097758578092
Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her <UNK> and <UNK> , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with Miss Bennet . 2908.2714630632995
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one <UNK> idea of any thing . 2908.8996485455546
We passed each other several times . 629.62186290662
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! 2436.000062474049
" Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? 1482.4206602901738
As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . 3856.596058436405
Lizzy <UNK> she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . " " And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems an hopeless business . " " <UNK> to Lizzy about it yourself . 4351.558267742623
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 3506.070966640231
Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . 2221.4215586599466
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . 1060.19522352719
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . 3442.072424304659
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s foot <UNK> , that she said , ' Mr . Collins , you must marry . 2730.2049163708207
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! 2107.208332485006
" Upon my word , " said Mrs . 916.911030552317
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton . 2220.808406553013
She is grown so <UNK> and <UNK> ! 772.1695634450256
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " <UNK> you ! 1990.777396334166
His temptation is not <UNK> to the risk . " " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment . 2993.411225499014
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my <UNK> and <UNK> are not usually <UNK> by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of <UNK> ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . Pardon me . It pains me to offend you . 6391.153695691188
The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 1870.92636494323
She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 4010.363488803443
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <UNK> silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <UNK> between them again . 3370.743123916931
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . 1476.7255405197404
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . 1477.6328350259778
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy . 1867.6133135539574
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room . 4716.937119648426
From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . 4594.578169416388
CHAPTER XVII . 158.33268212522805
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more <UNK> , and less <UNK> than the other had ever seen him . 3802.0929743302167
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? 1476.8240211054137
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . 2635.336491430729
But are you pleased , Jane ? 631.2073908283422
Jane was distressed . 254.43200008209539
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . 2994.874469818681
He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . " " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . 3507.344462397606
Section . 83.99007840409676
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <UNK> ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 2821.0198971102286
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . " " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . " " I beg your pardon . 3375.0437242599623
" Good gracious ! " cried Mrs . 773.2973301808013
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 1479.6104364783776
" They will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . 4011.7499182138595
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . 2825.992950804199
Bennet was <UNK> in her acknowledgments . 630.6408107119044
Her mind was less difficult to <UNK> . 770.3515087488944
The hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . 2995.487017122414
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . 1056.6437895399044
This cannot be ! 254.41843737399276
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
are sufficiently known . 254.25655510885846
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 3152.4522488534967
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some <UNK> in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . 5267.734922004315
I rather wonder now at your knowing any . " " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " I never saw such a woman . 3751.0507789756034
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged . 3856.605742818297
" I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . " " Who do you mean , my dear ? 4631.276545963016
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . 3157.18612245236
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 2729.8604113372667
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . 2821.595610166219
At that moment , she cared for no other . 1056.6758848564978
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 3959.466972635393
" Good Heaven ! 255.98670188419564
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " Well , Jane , who is it from ? 3230.045915989011
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . " " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <UNK> which other people may observe . 5178.858563178852
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a <UNK> table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the <UNK> of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . 4771.492559953124
But your arts and <UNK> may , in a moment of <UNK> , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . 3076.6874022625184
How much you must have gone through ! " Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs . 3689.330532789315
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ' s performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste . 2436.20690831471
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . 4901.400530162706
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . 3230.7689882417003
Forster , the delight of Mrs . 629.4442037225117
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 4876.553746261936
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . 3958.439501892644
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 4950.970229163236
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . 2333.7478954719522
I will only add , God bless you . 916.5270523202347
It <UNK> , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . 5018.464067073547
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different <UNK> ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . 2821.0884052031693
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . 3155.0706845860063
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 4145.174953733267
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it . 1745.7461226571252
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 2996.415954478737
It is what every body says . 631.1383622503503
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 4881.284670928873
Annesley is with her . 367.8158798440775
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 3801.7813214633197
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? 1872.8322483784443
I knew how it would be . 632.3572927062514
You have delighted us long enough . 630.3133956475274
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little <UNK> by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . 4460.600240178012
I know you will contrive it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . 5162.970935508427
But if I go on , I shall <UNK> you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . 2333.385696467252
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever <UNK> , and the <UNK> friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . 4462.011393031234
It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> . 1201.339995855443
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 769.9722120683203
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a <UNK> library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read <UNK> . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose <UNK> ' s <UNK> . 4903.220314105742
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 4656.84655960769
In the former were many good <UNK> ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some <UNK> of Miss Darcy ' s , in <UNK> , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . 4529.9175327183575
" Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal <UNK> , you last night laid to my charge . 2825.6407294633304
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> . 3441.4548850071583
But in what <UNK> it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . 2333.3994686453225
" You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice . 3913.8389358817117
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction . 1611.5278235499654
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . 1989.5265827865335
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of <UNK> them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <UNK> , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the <UNK> kind . " She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <UNK> by any feeling of <UNK> . 5284.565606690786
Pray do not talk of that odious man . 912.7642732115498
Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . 3230.9453186896276
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in <UNK> to the proposal before him . 3568.5369587759046
" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? 1343.869731631461
<UNK> in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . 1056.2062306174107
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . 1479.9470056199777
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . " Elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! 3806.899104316905
you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 5683.81801710254
At night she opened her heart to Jane . 913.0719492817601
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . 3629.440436806791
I knew that Mr . Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . 1481.4034023136685
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth . 3303.6222605503353
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . " Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less <UNK> of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too <UNK> by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . 5332.709994508434
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and <UNK> study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . " And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his <UNK> she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . 5233.00905014517
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 3155.5985441528
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can <UNK> so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most <UNK> to a <UNK> ' s mind . 3907.389785201589
The <UNK> <UNK> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have . 4564.703991902585
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . 3073.7849043785104
" You write uncommonly fast . " " You are mistaken . 1344.630143113546
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 1744.2476528219827
" Can you come to morrow ? " Yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 3078.7825774900202
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 4353.234272432485
" Oh ! 159.45205162549917
But no such recollection <UNK> her . 631.2155181309969
I will not tell you what it is . 916.5670246072123
Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . 2732.297874163663
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 2642.1606432317403
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 2436.3586194325103
I am quite well . 370.29810922271463
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of <UNK> , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . 5250.310756589262
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill <UNK> of Lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . 4009.0744063742386
" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . 4060.3344426419308
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 3689.8314000225255
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . 2540.952644330428
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his <UNK> to myself . 3371.654559438728
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . 3155.454706446638
<UNK> there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or <UNK> . 2537.2813868198864
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . 2908.1892089825383
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her . 1060.19522352719
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . 629.8875639829727
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of <UNK> on Mr . Collins ' s side , and as many bows on Sir William ' s , they departed . 3855.8647454210122
Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in <UNK> , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and <UNK> a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire . 5477.912832000986
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so <UNK> with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and <UNK> of her own family ! 3958.0495952166734
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . 3300.703256201618
Bingley was the principal <UNK> , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 1476.9961522726485
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . 1611.6647024084823
" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides <UNK> tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! " Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . 5104.246407117814
Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 5422.662231469045
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . " " I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which <UNK> in <UNK> a respectable man . 4902.449341262852
It would be dreadful ! 368.8876045224903
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <UNK> family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . 3858.1176457059314
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . 2730.0255466216813
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . 3305.7501165298354
They must have seen them together for ever . " " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . 3747.367295164605
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . 2908.85928892144
" But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . " Elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . 4598.674023893299
How strange must it appear to him ! 769.9722120683203
<UNK> terms will be <UNK> to the Project Gutenberg tm License for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work . 3227.8060375975083
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object . 1613.7904920276999
<UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . 912.6647652804965
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . 3506.4022502111543
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 2331.6925492582277
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . " From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . 3910.862358428976
Miss Lucas is married and settled . 629.5977326768113
and it was not wholly without foundation . 769.836265553342
" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . 1745.882038027438
" Let us sit down . 496.85565700790477
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <UNK> , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 3076.839799958551
Mr . Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . 1613.7413259971192
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . 2220.5758532843297
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . 2330.533146058374
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . 4103.15070063526
What <UNK> money , what <UNK> , what carriages you will have ! 1477.069188499344
I thought I should have died . 632.3735781927214
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . 1746.1621003408081
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 5019.106837969024
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , <UNK> against the <UNK> conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . 4926.907813766696
Pray , how violent was Mr . Bingley ' s love ? " " I never saw a more promising inclination . 2538.4285229755155
The business was therefore soon settled . 631.1682978177064
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . 3859.4431830947183
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . 3439.705827169815
but no one can throw any blame on them . 1056.2917858658675
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 1743.3802485888275
Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began . 4314.473035069285
Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . 2330.258489816444
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " I never heard that it was . " " And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . 4352.062720714301
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth . 3568.4856520810513
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 4390.194190486377
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat <UNK> attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must <UNK> every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <UNK> . 4878.619173055444
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 3152.0462144585276
Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . " Mr . Bennet made no answer . 2538.2491285313595
But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! 3077.2453001605913
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield . 2537.7513120420335
<UNK> pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . 2537.3090577004255
Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . 4350.5064123150605
Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . 3961.2725392738903
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you . 2638.7430402198215
But that is one great difference between us . 915.0968068470794
Lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . 3371.2737646107457
Mr . Darcy is engaged to my daughter . 915.3967782897437
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly <UNK> . 4234.983428532847
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . 4235.5706314240715
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman <UNK> the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . 4881.52483486341
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <UNK> in the gaieties which that season generally <UNK> , and that your <UNK> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall <UNK> you . " " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . " " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . " " Why will you think so ? 5303.767017677047
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . 4350.797151157232
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome . 3856.5506065984746
Bennet , " that is very unlucky . " " Can I have the carriage ? " said Jane . 2333.0028855739683
I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . 2112.0382779849256
" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . 1994.2427723605279
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . 3157.0370623875206
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <UNK> her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 4271.847506118847
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , glancing at her sister and Bingley , shall take place . 4350.562525473784
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . " While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much <UNK> to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s . 5504.2814412324005
But I will no longer <UNK> my young cousin . " Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his <UNK> at backgammon . 2996.263615725119
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including <UNK> , online payments and credit card donations . 2220.507417364917
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . 1992.2181252276034
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . 1610.9326497313289
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . 916.9943917777778
" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs . 2226.3682679240837
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . 1200.842379895926
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 3855.1699225862426
You have employed your time much better . 770.8379957543054
I am so grieved for him . 632.8034840932992
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 1479.5511408141022
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . 2635.3088198613873
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her <UNK> . 4274.307616881013
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 3907.4392688539274
He is perfectly amiable . 368.9445057414676
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day . " " Oh , yes . 3228.5985392201364
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! 1610.88196953027
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 368.7925948280616
I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . " " You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr . Darcy . " " No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ' s connections . 5043.082550317011
These were the contents " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . 3907.537541424419
Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a <UNK> chaise . " " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . 3229.411545466242
I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . 1615.637130758766
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . 3077.1255009721413
I do not wish to avoid the walk . 916.6768162851703
But his pride , his abominable pride , his <UNK> avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in <UNK> , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . 5018.950391385732
" Oh ! 159.45205162549917
He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father ' s intentions . 4852.829403719956
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it . 2107.977800604162
She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . 3231.2287433827014
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 2224.246510469697
But you are always giving her the preference . " " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . " " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? 4801.522226662378
" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . " While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . 3859.9761440070456
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ? 2911.72579948906
Kitty was the only one who <UNK> tears ; but she did <UNK> from vexation and envy . 2106.923599489284
That he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . 1741.3579864220915
It was all conjecture . " " What is it you mean ? " " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing . " " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . " " And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . 5143.93582531403
Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . 4594.599136007953
Does he know his real character ? " " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . 2908.436190277502
CHAPTER IX . 158.33268212522805
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the <UNK> of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 4496.072401764092
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of Darcy ' s . " " Oh ! 2538.6629184290405
We must not all expect Jane ' s good fortune . " " True , " said Mr . Bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may <UNK> you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . " Mr . Wickham ' s society was of material service in <UNK> the gloom , which the late <UNK> occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family . 5198.209030839396
It was over at last however . 631.3561160111904
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? " Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . 3633.975055358517
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . 2221.6522300004767
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " I saw you look at me to day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . 4532.333015586782
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . 1741.461029091363
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . 2442.341621849719
She could not <UNK> him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . 2541.2433747920245
Collins was settled near her family . " " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . 2331.0969327140187
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a <UNK> space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . 4925.385822208425
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . 2993.209807421527
All field <UNK> were over . 494.25832902391664
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . " " Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . 4352.121980606007
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 4147.814971150698
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . 1203.063732047798
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 3567.9545604240534
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . 2107.85703817036
who could have done less for her ? 769.7363162348285
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs . 1741.2802652552043
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ; but his <UNK> about the whole Pemberley family are endless . 3301.327430440665
A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone . 1867.7054856466461
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ' s character . " Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " <UNK> there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 4192.855767132818
In understanding Darcy was the superior . 629.8473782285186
Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a <UNK> air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . 3907.340798475846
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 2825.772552589456
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . " " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . " " In <UNK> your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were <UNK> . 5424.85177147885
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 2334.350672615486
I cannot understand it . 370.00810575806156
How are you all ? " " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 2635.7922515774244
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ? 2112.452319726922
The path just admitted three . 495.80396209481205
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 1200.176909506479
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . 5478.555002060922
If , indeed , it should be so ! 913.3192574511975
They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! 2994.11589111518
We must have Mrs . 368.0644276703161
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . " " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger . 4745.865895918285
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . 1198.8271559087295
" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? " " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . " " La ! " replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . 4775.917695738144
Mr . Darcy <UNK> you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . 2224.2071389480902
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 4460.611047830209
They could describe an entertainment with <UNK> , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . 2538.874924336282
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . 1613.6531811616796
Let the other young ladies have time to <UNK> . " Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . <UNK> of the party were now applied to . 4529.30013622974
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . 4529.556605478687
She represented to him all the <UNK> of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . 3231.1210135061765
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 2435.765707419588
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 4594.357692902081
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a <UNK> denial , and ride off as fast as I could . " " Would Mr . Darcy then consider the <UNK> of your original intention as <UNK> for by your obstinacy in <UNK> to it ? " " Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . " " You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . 5664.778743415529
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself . 3802.0912435975583
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . 1198.8271543030048
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley . 3751.544091450132
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such <UNK> , and her intreaty that she would not give into it . 2992.717076967066
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . 2539.473502989394
We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . 3074.151172792286
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . The possibility of his having really endured such <UNK> , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained . 5610.065238605036
Lakes , mountains , and <UNK> , shall not be <UNK> together in our <UNK> ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . 3628.977909235452
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . 1994.1426551824964
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . 769.8817042562835
Annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs . 3745.860549286817
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . 1611.677936267814
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . 4231.23452576951
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 1992.634337488677
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . " " Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . 4273.202693046795
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . " " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 4597.414914162941
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . " " You observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . " " Certainly not . " " To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! 5235.063220201377
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 3443.7733134369496
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <UNK> . 1615.61168044004
" Not at all . 370.03983192984305
I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . 1481.3292886090753
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . 1339.285099714314
<UNK> an only son , for many years an only child I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , my father particularly , all that was <UNK> and amiable , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and <UNK> , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . 5232.602516956057
Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ? 1476.7993210023956
<UNK> any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . " " Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . 5449.594869108318
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . 2731.12067847834
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . 4495.900800646962
I am sick of them all . 632.795330564996
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr . Bingley ? " " When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . 4314.723380804919
To know that her daughter would be married was enough . 1199.2227346371355
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . 1340.0878306522163
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room . 3374.1168040288317
I was never more <UNK> ! 496.89469925309487
I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . " " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . 4533.585585631542
She had high <UNK> spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . 3961.3341275334715
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them . 4564.90534231184
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . 3804.5533753403815
But on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . 3691.5527081844184
Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . 1741.293241830199
She dared not even mention that gentleman . 772.0785141434151
" <UNK> he will not leave London before he has found them . 1481.3223388973483
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company . 1198.8724398421573
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . 2908.8454283728997
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . " " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . 5141.226162978367
They are all for what they can get . 913.8812310596153
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an <UNK> with her brother for talking such nonsense . 2436.3306316769476
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . 3689.088808704469
I am going away myself . " " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . " And upon Elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr . Collins . " Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . 5676.18591704519
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? 1198.9177543758933
" Oh ! 159.45205162549917
" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . 2825.889324833456
<UNK> more than half a day ' s journey . 1056.2383126432505
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . <UNK> are never of so much consequence to a father . 2729.5565117387137
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation . 2331.2046836564664
Well , well , I only hope it will last . 1199.1667174252473
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . 1990.0868172811095
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and <UNK> mercenary ; and the <UNK> of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to <UNK> at any thing . 3855.861288807691
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . 4594.368238883694
Lydia ' s going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . 2992.6902525045125
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . 1343.61467475474
And what sort of young lady is she ? 913.428181272564
Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . 2221.149947153578
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund . 3505.4649606162834
Jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all . 1199.2116559519175
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . " Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where Mrs . 5438.175594367435
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my <UNK> and care . 3152.585845589985
This room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . 2635.778179066668
" You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . 2226.1349989030664
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 2223.1964730773343
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . 5692.985156498088
But I am at his disposal . 631.4997148834153
Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . 4007.8090822033564
But , Lizzy ! 255.4081434796259
I will put on my things in a moment . 1060.3882795408967
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by <UNK> a <UNK> , or covering a <UNK> . 2732.670957678033
I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 4777.870955729081
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 1339.6400814960455
There was also a <UNK> of one thousand pounds . 1056.9317392871305
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . 1198.8158251609266
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 3229.5480384502557
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ' s folly . " " Indeed you are mistaken . 3152.073499243293
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . " " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . " Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . 5061.92541515641
Gardiner . 84.10084178660469
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she <UNK> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . " Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . 4973.869662345874
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy . 2330.2171394840007
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . 2993.2470889989804
In Three Volumes . 254.57066874377242
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> . 1201.595220073238
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . 4311.663691663865
" Yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally <UNK> , without raising all this <UNK> ! 3509.2723485902225
If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was <UNK> done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . With respect to that other , more <UNK> <UNK> , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only <UNK> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 5017.479157544689
my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . " " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . 4973.042957695864
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips . 1611.588317857988
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 1741.0337204060825
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . 2993.2355511694323
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr . Darcy . 4316.456605171803
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . " " You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . 4657.8645638468515
Collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . 1477.1066493475998
But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . 3692.0494198163265
After walking several miles in a <UNK> manner , and too <UNK> to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their <UNK> , that it was time to be at home . 3746.213613084051
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the <UNK> of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . 4800.359046625353
You supposed more than really existed . 630.2241161118177
Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . 4006.988660034047
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 3074.613183446485
She will make him a very proper wife . " Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the <UNK> , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly <UNK> whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way . 4774.379572640623
At length , she spoke again . 629.751726523345
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation . 2541.5326102763984
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 4233.671890380133

I am afraid you will be angry . " " My dearest sister , now be be serious . 2226.7706478688283
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford <UNK> , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 4595.309986391179
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away . 3506.8617758157266
CHAPTER X . 158.33268212522805
. E . . You may convert to and distribute this work in any <UNK> , <UNK> , marked up , <UNK> or <UNK> form , including any word <UNK> or <UNK> form . 3504.6313284246894
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it . 5123.954137170777
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . 3154.5729843901354
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a <UNK> situation , and always spending more than they ought . 2637.082125611658
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . 2220.808336824285
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . 3630.1320380877173
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 1989.1106782105473
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her <UNK> you . " Mrs . 4275.804008451351
sir , I do indeed . 494.19535782522115
Kitty and Lydia were far from <UNK> Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . 3746.1763874732906
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F . 1203.0410050681742
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it . 3634.7656977010106
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh . 631.3723883906052
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 2539.4735029893923
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . 2108.446840354547
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well . 1990.0344260587929
Long will do any such thing . 629.4117300935089
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him . 1745.746122657122
" Well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " What say you to the day ? 2827.3092879155924
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 3801.8316604919723
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not <UNK> a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . 4562.399997570873
" I admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he . 1747.1537974595894
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no <UNK> the frequent mention of Wickham ' s name . 2539.013105109866
. 34.63748678533662
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 3801.8689479742843
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . " " You are over <UNK> surely . 3152.8978992692023
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 4272.098451703207
It was very little less . 495.97328632437603
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . 3962.1421052708133
Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . 3690.981276142505
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 3961.2495691915037
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . 2638.4687257082837
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr . <UNK> . 3073.988825225171
Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent <UNK> and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . " Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " You cannot have a right to such very strong <UNK> attachment . 4825.838274343473
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 4351.119649285621
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . 2638.5518113892413
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> . 2637.0121680907214
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . 4926.748393669757
" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently . 2112.1667148129673
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . 1341.4288690419335
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 2543.3758212027974
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 3376.25155681532
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 3688.8082547272056
Good Heaven ! 158.17299927526295
But it was a hope shortly checked by other <UNK> , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . 4531.762748128953
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <UNK> have alarmed her . 2540.482394431639
" My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . " But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . 5303.512463311386
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? 1199.605960309608
Bennet . 84.29501402535595
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 1741.3966980449952
But it must not , shall not be . 915.1665856894367
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 2108.405881621856
is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must <UNK> us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . " Then shewing her purchases " <UNK> here , I have bought this bonnet . 4562.103236328438
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . 1476.7624712768152
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 3230.771570419952
" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam . 2112.071468452699
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 3439.0886326458212
Who could about such a <UNK> little <UNK> thing ? " Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <UNK> and fancied liberal ! 4145.033942107277
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry . 3301.3809250676113
The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . 4314.146036289081
And a special licence . 368.20237197372387
But Mrs . 158.9212671001256
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what <UNK> his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 4927.50973628125
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 3803.0871139488872
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . 1481.6433417080807
Why does she not come in ? " " Oh ! 1199.3702231748905
He has more to give . 495.57397124230437
It is almost past belief . 495.78512309717684
" Gracechurch street , <UNK> . 496.8415690058127
His attachment to Rosings , certainly <UNK> . " Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 3569.078144478709
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . 3231.2798867029333
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 2992.77197884456
Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " This walk is not wide enough for our party . 2439.291801000088
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . " " Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> . 4315.958546975369
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . 2908.4773855737226
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . " " What should not you mind ? " " I should not mind any thing at all . " " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . " " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail . 4878.915814860295
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so <UNK> courted you . 4311.765252664539
In a few minutes , Mrs . 629.9691016780132
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 2908.3263070915445
" And that , " said Mrs . 773.5892579801475
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 3074.6675191974405
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . 1198.8044977316074
This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better . 4231.3841022296965
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . 3568.8710576926715
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . 2733.1406409070887
Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <UNK> and <UNK> father ; and though he belonged to one of the <UNK> , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 4903.448708589503
Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time . 2731.9395053672342
" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . 2441.333655339555
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . " " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . " To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <UNK> of an elegant female . 5901.770950251382
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 4149.06615574502
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . 1992.323084820629
" It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . 3306.972493407912
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . 1340.5214124307865
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 4353.355917747936
Younge was of course removed from her charge . 912.7443845758847
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child . 2910.643671423262
And it was settled that we should all be there by <UNK> o ' clock . 1868.0068219287475
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and <UNK> , though <UNK> families . 3505.849747034282
It is too long ago . 495.78512309717684
Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by <UNK> to his sister . 3507.9162323815267
But so they always are . 495.8447706869193
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? 1477.0083759949168
Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . " " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . " " I believe , Ma ' am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . " " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . 5349.6249253195565
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . " The wedding took place ; the bride and <UNK> set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . 4388.126733076402
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry <UNK> , a very mean art . " " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is <UNK> in all the arts which ladies sometimes <UNK> to employ for <UNK> . 4314.404038179516
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true <UNK> will derive benefit from such as are given . 3907.696828664421
A few weeks , he believed . 629.5734707116873
Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 3504.735907278715
Lydia <UNK> as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very <UNK> solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips <UNK> of turning away <UNK> , and if he does , Colonel Forster will <UNK> him . 4495.276856305682
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . 3301.407012049126
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . " To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . 3748.747343034833
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . 2636.233443803922
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . 1741.4870143568269
A small sum could not do all this . " " No , " said her father , " Wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a <UNK> less than ten thousand pounds . 3746.959029878061
Pray read on . " " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she <UNK> so disgraceful a match . 4925.216055115165
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . 4627.274580324361
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <UNK> circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her <UNK> and steady candour always <UNK> for <UNK> , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 4562.526345257646
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " I have just received your letter , and shall <UNK> this whole morning to answering it , as I <UNK> that a little writing will not <UNK> what I have to tell you . 3859.8641198320965
So much the better . 367.8737995942194
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty . 1613.5160570685036
Hart was the <UNK> of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone . 2729.777492995545
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . " " And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the <UNK> of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! 5284.790968829923
That he has neither integrity nor honour . 769.9723969703664
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . " " I would wish not to be hasty in <UNK> any one ; but I always speak what I think . " " I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder . 4394.506125284755
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . 2638.5102829413913
<UNK> he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 3152.1409753931093
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . 2220.8628272848296
If he had been <UNK> before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity <UNK> could make him . 4351.041782576828
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 3803.099608577028
Her cousin <UNK> his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the <UNK> of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . " It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . 4877.02095897794
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 4426.909306889982
This letter is from Mr . Collins . " " From Mr . Collins ! 1741.5003955142365
When is your turn to come ? 629.8072375271068
Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . " Then addressing her daughter , " Oh ! 2820.8280747672725
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . 3441.8734540207925
What do you keep winking at me for ? 913.0819055772945
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . 4146.508957199955
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there . 1476.9469037394804
Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to <UNK> . 3749.2517494488065
I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . 2441.272395187971
Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise . 915.3570584504573
<UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . " " We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . " " But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs . 5197.904265747246
I thought I should have broke my heart . " " I am sure I shall break mine , " said Lydia . 2642.5486019524055
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . 3507.2408622417506
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 1477.2042711815452
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . 1199.61626744982
They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <UNK> <UNK> and head <UNK> there is not much the matter with me . 3908.5245980736777
" Oh ! 159.45205162549917
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . 4771.760810444856
When the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a <UNK> to her mother ' s <UNK> for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . 4851.930370559009
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . 4102.952582314347
<UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 2729.6394135693026
You see on what a footing we are . 913.8506085057882
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . 4100.951525256364
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . 1477.485789672808
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . 2107.343662739563
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . 1201.4271973590862
She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . 3077.1527284059416
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 4314.0667594197175
But , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 2333.771307466118
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . 1990.074172236807
Bennet was quite in the <UNK> . 630.6651940884727
CHAPTER X . 158.33268212522805
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . 2223.1300810121056
Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , <UNK> exclaimed , " Good Lord ! 3302.926976352108
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 5439.032182285795
Collins and myself sincerely <UNK> with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the <UNK> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 3746.1253630421943
Have you seen any pleasant men ? 629.3712600631868
" Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . " " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . " " Oh ! 3807.4833670878616
He placed himself by her . 495.5037716455499
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 3632.4287270080977
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable . 2911.5037057937925
At length the chaise arrived , the <UNK> were <UNK> on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . 2821.1438823867047
The pause was to Elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . 1058.7679556905196
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . " It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . 3907.709471874351
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they <UNK> with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy . 4951.075022318547
I will leave him to himself . " In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . 4011.405872259872
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very <UNK> manner , with all the <UNK> which he supposed a regular part of the business . 4743.662391459698
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . " " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . " " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . 4658.251927187689
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . 2110.130727015627
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? 1476.799387262819
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and <UNK> <UNK> with great perseverance . 2537.8473179795556
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . 1611.703524233325
why did she come ? 367.81008746800734

I know we dine with four and twenty families . " Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could <UNK> Bingley to keep his countenance . 2734.8166364355084
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time . 2438.8924927718904
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 3438.7332190005377
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 1198.9064340057946
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . 4628.856350660965
<UNK> and <UNK> I can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart . 2729.542689135304
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ? 2436.7690145981437
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will <UNK> excite . 3856.661546839999
They crossed it by a <UNK> bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a <UNK> , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the <UNK> <UNK> wood which bordered it . 4687.123852368119
" There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London . 4104.961801031817
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose <UNK> of <UNK> support . 2435.8207707197103
Miss Darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . 4272.406406956927
shocking ! " cried Miss Bingley . 629.3226184381832
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . 1741.66753163504
" If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . 3234.170867706008
Jane was by no means better . 629.6627405443252
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 5144.275174612903
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . 2823.5812881589086
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 2732.740138836285
" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir . 1482.454741753055
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . 3230.7177164863933
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 2730.492670246064

She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 2439.292837108552
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 1989.6868995688706
I have no such <UNK> to resent . 773.3019121171852
Her performance on the piano forte is <UNK> . " " It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . " " All young ladies accomplished ! 4146.416027891028
You never see a fault in any body . 913.8406438282761
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 1746.136047163362
no it is not for me to be driven away by Mr . Darcy . 1741.3452499489729
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . 2821.335402517002
I dare say the <UNK> upon Mrs . 773.0650348357191
Long has promised to introduce him . " " I do not believe Mrs . 1743.0904259174526
<UNK> , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . 4054.2047035948467
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 3908.324121878986
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
" I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she . 1874.2205408032796
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
He knows where we live . 495.51079563427334
" I do not get on at all . 917.407728691762
Miss Bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs . 1611.3377140484768
I will answer for it he never cared three <UNK> about her . 1481.390869708088
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . 4103.496708727612
Elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several <UNK> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . 4973.101531031382
YOU AGREE THAT YOU <UNK> NO <UNK> FOR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . F . . YOU AGREE THAT THE <UNK> , THE <UNK> <UNK> , AND ANY <UNK> <UNK> THIS <UNK> <UNK> NOT <UNK> <UNK> TO YOU FOR <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> DAMAGES <UNK> <UNK> YOU <UNK> <UNK> OF THE <UNK> OF <UNK> <UNK> . 5059.1231711407845
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? 912.8040729349806
So high and so conceited that there was no <UNK> him ! 1339.2732275174053
" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . 1344.024387279487
But I suppose you had no opportunity . 772.1313122893007
You will be a very happy woman . " Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 2822.194583414386

Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . 2635.654584429153
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . 1341.371865820436
I must beg to return to the house . " And she rose as she spoke . 1994.2099450422381
Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits <UNK> high . 3229.6421840125195
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard <UNK> in any of the family . 3438.8649094204966
and his sisters are charming women . 629.4036478104638
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . " Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . 2913.130882407367
her liveliness had been never worse <UNK> . 769.6817669156377
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 2908.60050195146
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at <UNK> ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . 4007.553631448628
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 5528.377681385522
Bennet give up the point . 495.2500657052971
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 3858.822751825589
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 3632.850758558378
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 4147.811199516148
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . 1995.027655556742
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . 1990.8310923117497
Your sweetness and <UNK> are really <UNK> ; I do not know what to say to you . 2107.5066005838307
" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she . 1873.9551830889473
That lady I suppose is your mother . " Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . 1989.419052079094
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears <UNK> the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the <UNK> . 3372.417551576206
What am I to do ? " " Nothing child , nothing . 1477.2170073096056
But I knew I should persuade you at last . 1059.1189692244504
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 1741.2670318305763
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 3301.6347759557543
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . 2330.217225237045
You must learn some of my philosophy . 770.8652670924132
<UNK> is impossible ; <UNK> , <UNK> . 769.6272085766076
We acted with the best intentions . " " Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " He brought it with him for us to see . " Jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to Elizabeth . 4388.603101225073
" DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations . 1615.592045337302
I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 4747.902224419104
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 2822.2643904146094
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette . 1476.885524690395
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with <UNK> and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as <UNK> an air as possible . " Mr . Bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . 5178.7408257673505
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley . 1059.0247235158786
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . 1480.4132782361376
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more <UNK> purpose . 2108.3924973635385
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings . 3372.709592367775
But these things happen so often ! 631.2155250490399
CHAPTER III . 158.33268212522805
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . 5917.328793294566
But it is of small importance . " " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and <UNK> me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? 4498.954562940218
Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side . 3370.928945838558
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however <UNK> its existence might prove , had at least <UNK> one day . 5198.891527700178
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Bennet very dull for several days . 630.5191207089719
When this was done , she had a less active part to play . 1611.55118480358
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . 1989.124160257288
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . 1615.4084002423867
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . 4853.175758345006
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . 1203.1255667292553
But self , though it would intrude , could not <UNK> her . 1479.5734187625999
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in <UNK> , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . 5234.813135967137
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 1342.0176551270356
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <UNK> , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . 4745.513332708732

my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 2221.095714454116
She was ashamed to think how much . 772.4786409168956
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . " Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . 3567.8249387886294
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your <UNK> . " " I should imagine not . " " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . 5018.966419200225
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the <UNK> Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . 4532.06555181443
I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 3634.747111971029
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 4009.2314620437537
Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . 2540.8688218663383
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . 1613.148436512483
With the <UNK> concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 2820.7587965210005
He has heartily <UNK> me now . " Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . 3691.009799698258
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . 914.3917661377292
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from <UNK> in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death <UNK> of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and <UNK> as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly <UNK> her father not to let her go . 4901.532469077035
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . 1060.19522352719
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and <UNK> them , after a short <UNK> , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . 3746.4152113044765
I send no compliments to your mother . 773.0467838838364
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . 3689.3284375521266
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 4596.850423396084
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 5318.204398595934
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . " CHAPTER IV . 3803.2126682933977
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . 1339.37992141695
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . 1741.8481086455768
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the <UNK> old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . 4688.56431309264
They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy . 4496.564037472686

The morrow produced no <UNK> of Mrs . 771.7507251567029
I had hoped that our sentiments <UNK> in every particular , but I must so far <UNK> from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . " " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . 5020.63970729911
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . 913.0719998317497
Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . 1059.013197423094
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much <UNK> ; but when Mrs . 5039.279839642365
Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . 1989.3523073553545
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " Their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . 5301.594287463389
" You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age . " " I am not one and twenty . " When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . 4237.386273625025
Bennet , who assured him with some <UNK> that they were very well able to keep a good <UNK> , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <UNK> . 3373.2828658127924
Ten thousand a year ! 367.8274673332448
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 2637.6257456493668
She often tried to provoke Darcy into <UNK> her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . 2995.7876573640997
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an <UNK> of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . 3303.4617101406566
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . " " Ah ! 2112.4185023901605
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and <UNK> them up , though as she never came without <UNK> some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or <UNK> , she seldom went away without leaving them more <UNK> than she found them . 4562.3465175579695
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . 3438.8254335000106
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 5300.338507008973
" It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . 2336.6760754914358
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
My watchfulness has been <UNK> ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I <UNK> in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance . 3802.091819314682
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty <UNK> , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . 3629.6198558193637
<UNK> it be so ? " " Oh , lord ! 1198.9856515611762
I hope he will overlook it . 632.3409903263235
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . 3301.9222229126267
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . " She was then proceeding to all the particulars of <UNK> , muslin , and <UNK> , and would shortly have <UNK> some very <UNK> orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted . 4925.422588522856
<UNK> , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . 2537.3090577004255
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 1616.1939433301388
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <UNK> with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 3229.870864331177
CHAPTER XV . 158.33268212522805
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . 2330.7255729735975
Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! 3300.6497744565554
oh ! 83.98610986891775
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <UNK> . 1744.2867006168028
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 3962.67858442212
She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 1201.7331907705245
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on . 3802.1288509545006
Dear me ! 158.16339304401765
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 5038.93850836602
Who are your uncles and <UNK> ? 629.3388131292501
Did you see it ? " Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . 1989.2181280773857
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <UNK> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 4656.506583566686
Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an <UNK> sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she <UNK> him . 4314.213241452448
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 2437.3693319202284
" It must not be thought of . 773.2972189973228
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 2638.756841049789
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . 915.297808743915
What will Wickham say ? 368.0297469311555
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . 770.2255111087333
Her mother <UNK> <UNK> , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 4145.911073100059
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , <UNK> from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and <UNK> by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 4996.175755400618
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 2635.571411894433
Bennet . 84.29501402535595
I dearly love a laugh . " " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . 2914.216937472809
Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , <UNK> that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ? 5652.745646537942
" Yours , c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . 3509.5210553905695
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my <UNK> . " " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . 3230.8227552641506
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . 4189.9645864060885
Now what have you to say ? " " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . " Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . 4529.300358836799
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself . 2108.5824520491688
Their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse . 1867.454440900654
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is <UNK> the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken <UNK> , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . 5366.068108332338
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been <UNK> by long expectations . 2224.114176820508
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be <UNK> . 2109.4573869698315
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . 769.8180624960132
what felicity ! 158.18260200732448
Gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . 1868.034631710735
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . 3960.6498940039896
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply <UNK> on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . 3630.8447894796295
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object . 769.8544484293403
On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . 3746.352891792639
I speak nothing but the truth . 632.2921168731663
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 1742.438223567336
Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . 1867.3623231248848
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . 1615.6498542646082
But do not imagine that he is always here so often . 1342.0889836110427
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
They were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs . 2822.333269790824
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to <UNK> ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . 3228.9917810186435
Has it not been <UNK> <UNK> by yourselves ? 912.6747143145902
I am very glad you liked her . 773.6655576316276
I don ' t know . 496.7821680141026
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 2107.045783686965
Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the <UNK> of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . 4054.431960605437

Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so . 2820.4972771836638
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a <UNK> , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! 2996.6191702445644
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . 1741.577240999062
" I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr . Darcy ! " " It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . " " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . " " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . " " <UNK> ! 5454.61098261198
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . 3077.777953205354
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . 3231.0537685828876
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . 4056.3451526055655
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 3746.4668435021013
The <UNK> and yet the noise ; the <UNK> and yet the self importance of all these people ! What would I give to hear your <UNK> on them ! " " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . 3960.566750284679
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . 1057.4383401237885
Her ladyship was highly incensed . 494.7254567573029
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . 4744.46196772216
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " Elizabeth could not but look surprised . 4055.810279524892
If a woman <UNK> her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . 3958.4741279197765
It is really too distressing . 495.7991791508143
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ' s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . 5102.823596573194
Oh , Lizzy ! 254.37358704520173
About the <UNK> , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . " Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings . 3438.7463803435953
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . 2994.9155482048477
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be <UNK> at , and it was rather too early to begin . 2541.0634348409403

I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you . 1994.1964819311397
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year . 3076.6900594069302
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . 4351.08874821909
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . 4629.494649228012
Wickham is safe . " " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . " " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane . 4657.639419881576
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 1202.9955636792708
I could hardly keep my countenance . 632.3247033721825
The moral will be perfectly fair . 631.1601642056075
Perhaps I am not doing her justice . 769.7726687100079
All was joy and kindness . 494.29336566068514
At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s <UNK> him entirely , for she was a most determined <UNK> ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making <UNK> and exclaiming after <UNK> , to have attention for any one in particular . 4626.054272962541
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! 1867.454440900654
Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane ' s ? 2222.730976124341
My affections and wishes are <UNK> , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . " Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very <UNK> , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . 5267.546982130852
<UNK> for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public <UNK> , but I wrote to Mr . Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs . 3300.6897857959975
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . " " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . 4876.937819483368
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . 1614.4776621679246
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over . 2908.0794694661304
Who should suffer but myself ? 494.244377157183
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 4351.209136188197
One seems so <UNK> without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth . 2993.2776173090874
Bennet was <UNK> engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <UNK> them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather <UNK> than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . 4926.65385683522
The express was sent off directly . 631.1682978177058
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others . 3568.6505697476487
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr . Darcy , she moved again towards the gate . 3305.2099092650396
" Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say . 2642.188517783954
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 769.8180624960132
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed . 4426.821362834385
" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire . 3079.027867661955
Her hair so <UNK> , so <UNK> ! " " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six <UNK> deep in <UNK> , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . " " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . 5039.369030523899
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the <UNK> , but of that I <UNK> . 3801.393419511013
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . 1056.3452390663083
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 5502.595055097199
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . 629.4036340368726
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 913.4878706346738
Bennet . They had several children . 630.5597369979528
Philips first brought her the news . " Well , so much the better . 1741.267257616366
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 5451.28281715472
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 2908.175656204822
She was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . 4463.850826108699
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . 913.8014118332816
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . 2995.8698591684633
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . 1744.2987430980295
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her <UNK> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . 4145.210164503759
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <UNK> from the marriage of her sisters . 2107.600749207426
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 2995.505072942147

No sentiment of shame gave a <UNK> to her triumph . 1198.9628333697756
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . 2330.1484376290123
Hill and the two <UNK> . 494.1953548459643
what has she to do with it ? 769.7635756001318
At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . 2221.2315557565607
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . 2993.2069099073865
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . 3568.5484052939073
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . " " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us . 4877.463863031014
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were <UNK> to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . 4771.780705009268
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . 5527.571988115823
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 3228.168757883576
I came to try you . 496.78921012466884
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . 2112.0110744866533
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . 2109.4873308590754
Her answer was warmly in his favour . 770.3697115468286
His disposition must be dreadful . " " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . " Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from <UNK> , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! " " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; <UNK> of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same <UNK> care . 6044.801930858541
A thousand things may arise in six months ! " The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . 2730.0944715584183
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " This was invitation enough . 2543.1076078743736
Her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . 3228.581856294175
Gardiner ' s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are <UNK> against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 4877.012849049647
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . " Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . 4903.324199475398
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . 1870.16050214594
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 2913.200001076102
The hill , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . 2823.563069453398
And for this we are to be thankful . 913.3983056188584
His words seemed to <UNK> it . 629.8391020773713
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the <UNK> ere long . " " Upon my word , Sir , " cried Elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . 4316.83953041877
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . 3692.497305258162
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . 2439.5002697789046
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . 1339.403630840325
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! 1199.0989349755362
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy . 3375.3650883387836
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished . 1992.8493228041623
Her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 2331.230817255635
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . " " Is that his design in settling here ? " " <UNK> ! 3075.570097319126
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth ! 2992.4304664441693
Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion . 1611.7799901203273
Mr . Bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . 4717.875261812986
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten . 2330.1484395796565
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . 4745.968450250778
Very nonsensical to come at all ! 629.3388280648762
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 4744.3742524489535
Oh , sister ! 254.36907979213925
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . " Kitty , who took all these <UNK> in a serious light , began to <UNK> . 4145.7706105270945
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . 1867.3093603987463
CHAPTER <UNK> . 158.31344539901033
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . 1743.3672417828063
