14.539926822348004
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 15.502986317100635
Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . " " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK> accordingly . " " You did ! 12.910437781880558
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . 14.273652578640817
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . 14.020132949020235
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister . 9.233778932616122
You thought me then <UNK> of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . 14.345996765389973
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . 14.101129855126478
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . " " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . 12.629620328537687
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . " " <UNK> ! " cried Bingley . 14.822765485030128
Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for . 6.194974595178734
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church . 14.567864866054476
" Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated . 9.054386033797229
It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . 33.89739340390346
" Oh ! 3.9535946941154325
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . 15.708277423829253
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 13.055921727193326
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . 6.783598987964581
They may be <UNK> and printed and given away you may do <UNK> <UNK> with public domain eBooks . 40.920380019407084
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his <UNK> , all honoured with the <UNK> of <UNK> , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . 18.620817609687784
" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party . 8.382265033607089
He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . 10.904768656676227
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . 7.059851963305709
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . 16.833973060800744
Five daughters <UNK> entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . 14.038868998381098
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . 27.738445072138944
good or bad ? " " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . 12.644751424446582
CHAPTER XV . 7.654260973594331
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now . 9.450355165217788
I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . 13.194804340585703
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with . 11.503145579671532
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . 19.633360307863025
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 15.797154978787756
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . 15.042684484120384
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . 14.166910808932846
Its <UNK> depended on others . 25.50091441799811
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 15.928294621965192
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . " " <UNK> their income ! 23.529387024035778
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . 16.888326767177233
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 5.169717602057356
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 12.669624414106464
You know I have . 3.8931178167590033
Her answer was warmly in his favour . 10.249350716831835
Long . 3.874480542123758
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . 10.949321520177222
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . 10.607586178254785
" I cannot make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by <UNK> for being next in the entail ? We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " No , my dear ; I think not . 15.56695569015493
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . 13.170383631563446
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . " " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . " Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . 12.197435281627794
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! 14.760159646382682
What say you , Mary ? 7.162231475541814
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 17.114988785872107
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . 14.096049997788244
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 27.005679865963135
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . " " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . " " In <UNK> your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were <UNK> . 16.490386289452147
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . 17.64305044090984
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . 11.1944414006012
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . 15.333431132275768
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . 14.879796648758493
Elizabeth took up some <UNK> , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . 18.92207971945139
But his pride , his abominable pride , his <UNK> avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in <UNK> , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . 18.712638666375963
Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . 10.369232716247472
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 12.880906313875792
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 18.3789822882733
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 13.359618571943052
Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . 9.92754618304138
CHAPTER XVII . 7.654260973594331
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr . Darcy , she moved again towards the gate . 12.106240141250899
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . 12.784975956391468
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <UNK> , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . 17.126537662624887
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have <UNK> domestic felicity in so <UNK> a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . 18.04848974435612

<UNK> , selfish girl ! 16.31453235681748
" How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! 7.977730913663553
I am not at all afraid of her dying . 6.9394513793621995
But you have chosen your fault well . I really cannot laugh at it . 12.87775344992118
I had hoped that our sentiments <UNK> in every particular , but I must so far <UNK> from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . " " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . 19.576662106150444
I was given good <UNK> , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 13.658875627732478
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 19.577383026428723
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . 14.357439524878115
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and <UNK> <UNK> with great perseverance . 23.29983032452542
She directly replied , " You need not be frightened . 10.046226132263017
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . 13.113609153887401
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . 7.690331985462681
Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 15.144658066023338
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . " " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request . 12.361284550606252
YOU AGREE THAT YOU <UNK> NO <UNK> FOR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . F . . YOU AGREE THAT THE <UNK> , THE <UNK> <UNK> , AND ANY <UNK> <UNK> THIS <UNK> <UNK> NOT <UNK> <UNK> TO YOU FOR <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> DAMAGES <UNK> <UNK> YOU <UNK> <UNK> OF THE <UNK> OF <UNK> <UNK> . 626.9502044504708
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . 25.548675352042398
But let me advise you to think better of it . 8.415499147216938
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . " Elizabeth could not <UNK> a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . 15.2419805608764
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern <UNK> , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . 18.11542662066272
She then <UNK> again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . " " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . " " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something <UNK> <UNK> in the usual <UNK> of such a meeting . 21.368776191023343
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in <UNK> <UNK> to be her husband , might then have <UNK> in its proper place . 26.25974293494411
CHAPTER II . 7.414109323913755
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . 15.294841780788555
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I cannot blame myself for having done thus much . 18.354354218297036
" He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 11.84099124263131
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . 13.043599330338303
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . " The wedding took place ; the bride and <UNK> set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . 15.643884505407263
He does not want abilities . 10.421816271834073
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . 10.521289443114565
Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 9.1639301542154
Her mind was less difficult to <UNK> . 15.386718835863519
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more . 8.61311824872087
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of <UNK> to others . 16.286342061588943

But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <UNK> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 31.95898968845097

" What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? 6.1777231153492975
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . 8.990489515149081
is she handsome ? " " She is a most charming young lady indeed . 10.294193881439526
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs . 11.8823194759605
The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . 11.17407336283129
I never was . 2.7478950554352175
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 18.08961665766337
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 19.9512268086332
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W . 18.443892564034712
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away . 11.485667756772292
He was angry . 4.9119221995846525
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " " That you certainly shall . " " And I have another favour to ask . 13.149844941081083
Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 12.457755686473217
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . 12.397016698943117
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were <UNK> of dejection . 17.872169368369335
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be <UNK> to you to let them go alone . " " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " " Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . 17.502486061706627
We must have Mrs . 5.315156313317264
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth ! 12.2858207676444
CHAPTER VIII . 7.654260973594331
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . " " Your first <UNK> is false . 14.280745402003001
I write without any intention of <UNK> you , or <UNK> myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the <UNK> , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . 15.625909647075622
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very <UNK> manner , with all the <UNK> which he supposed a regular part of the business . 18.05488649256249
His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . 11.758265337222394
Well , well , I only hope it will last . 6.307380755102392
So near a <UNK> to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart . 19.13145681500793
You never see a fault in any body . 9.979566906712284
The housekeeper came ; a respectable looking , <UNK> woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . 16.146594299164832
They entered it in one of its <UNK> points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , <UNK> over a wide extent . 29.74498246851577
It cannot be concealed from any one . 9.225952595372679
" But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing . 8.742776134836028
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . 14.997613127736802
Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side . 14.168882464204112
Where does discretion end , and <UNK> begin ? 30.442023518621962
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . 14.965719406519197
I shall go distracted . " This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . 17.501179085420564
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 16.555200009188617
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his <UNK> when he speaks . 19.81789343914915
Collins so before you came . 5.903634024899473
<UNK> such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 16.21519266960438
my dear , " continued Mrs . 4.538101057770705
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 16.036025339450898
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . 9.361376378948838
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . 7.883261739814131
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 12.972769778488244
" About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . " " Yes , " replied Wickham ; " his estate there is a noble one . 11.142762577761989
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . 25.382602441301266
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 29.04241793993566
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so <UNK> ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and <UNK> , " Let me call your maid . 16.8150946249332
You must therefore allow me to follow the <UNK> of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . 19.595174465364234
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . 15.080832915390364
But , Lizzy ! 4.297436331208823
<UNK> of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . " Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready <UNK> . 20.106957465271165
She does not yet leave her dressing room . 11.897028771644761
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . 17.417840355190688
Mr . Collins received and returned these <UNK> with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <UNK> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 24.36373032636304
His letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in <UNK> business , he was quick in its execution . 22.47947473697735

Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! Yes certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . " And <UNK> her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma ' am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr . Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . 16.104055352721026
" This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! 12.68995111845459
She certainly did not hate him . 8.5269352806966
CHAPTER IX . 7.654260973594331
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle . 10.522558848340589
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were <UNK> your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month . " " You have only proved by this , " cried Elizabeth , " that Mr . Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . 13.053653951139303
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . 11.479916295722349

I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . 10.4646774742375
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . 12.43030737581648
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . 30.39252005506231
It was a large , handsome , <UNK> building , standing well on rising ground , and <UNK> by a <UNK> of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was <UNK> into greater , but without any <UNK> appearance . 33.95998018288624
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 15.496770641052775
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . 15.94551104380025
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 16.534868498074918
. 1.5031584747735605
I wonder what he can be doing there . " " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth . 11.745338482746854
Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . 9.39738546493105
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . " " Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . 11.598014840207401

I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 17.252708256091935
and what can he have to say ? " " Something very much to the purpose of course . 7.910517995702929
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . 14.327956239559901
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 8.592063892899688
I do not trust my own partiality . 8.975061710881763

Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . " Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . 8.9126686674956
<UNK> Michael S . 24.937882676382568
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! 19.681344825700176
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well . 15.78792981319988
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . 16.47815279373834
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . 12.52361931659299
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 10.009440863149996
London Printed for T . 14.802801778996814
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 15.422106025289033
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of inviting him . " " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . 12.826510045490862
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 15.47219650021146
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . 10.566185155959248
He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . " " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . 15.356668499845918
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a <UNK> , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . " " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . 17.327269975050406
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . 15.700658667539518
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 12.482215759466744
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . 12.624522997263021
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . 11.48400129842354
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the <UNK> , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 14.572744068048673
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! 10.966994371661043
But it was not to be . 2.9811855611911517
I quite forgot ! 8.592428148438524
Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master . 17.518860535147876
We do not suffer by accident . 11.655092467908482
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so doubtful , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea . 18.853250139829008
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 12.859669011855216
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement . 14.615198614640232
These recollections will not do at all . 9.754895947002842
Their reception at home was most kind . 12.696475889618956
You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <UNK> is denied me , because you have always so much . " Mr . Bingley arrived . 14.760011377416202
He <UNK> how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an <UNK> manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there . 18.903688539263772
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? 15.80658298728934
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . 22.657996152828474
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 16.15980417374089
" I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she . 5.976462788891119
Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . " In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . 10.907050638766163
Is nothing due to me on that score ? 14.7028508134664
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " There can be no doubt of that . 11.19820944751515
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> . 17.629525950125068
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 13.782493630903947
it cannot be . 3.3031429667283168
but from what the report of their engagement could <UNK> , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . 12.793174915361266
All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . 19.24088234329902
What could your ladyship propose by it ? " " At once to insist upon having such a report universally <UNK> . " " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . " " If ! 14.365168743034136
<UNK> for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public <UNK> , but I wrote to Mr . Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs . 14.311452559246986
His words seemed to <UNK> it . 12.403146251601274
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such <UNK> , and her intreaty that she would not give into it . 13.422605817648956
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . 12.816227782607987
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 13.75847720294231
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . 6.650732109509142
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! 23.890837891641475
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . 18.277157469018317
So high and so conceited that there was no <UNK> him ! 18.749618464729284
Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces . 11.780337226374481
CHAPTER IX . 7.654260973594331
But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . " " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother . 8.668455960990315
I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . 9.217610342336844
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? 10.604979181752643
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in <UNK> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " said Jane as she finished it . 15.189317521532393
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . 16.508752185127896
" Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . 4.04718121891327
Bennet was quite in the <UNK> . 7.039003153762927
Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other . 8.757554001336795
Kitty was the only one who <UNK> tears ; but she did <UNK> from vexation and envy . 22.698212494300495
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . 9.613874227453852
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ? 14.489544434846794
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . 12.748939627375044
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <UNK> the excellent understanding , and <UNK> excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 17.249607290249894
She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa . 11.582475630054795
My aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . " " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . 12.689463905305294
But I will not repine . 6.0706923355621925
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . 15.359810160220228
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . 10.426786537920002
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! 13.749664950962002
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . 11.414903110587424
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 21.15826178728622
Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 9.994181326595687
" Let us sit down . 9.857905772593886
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 15.309678885846228
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 18.628276590639906
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day <UNK> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . 16.159391408922076
<UNK> felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . 9.432252842400427
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane . 7.564135492361688
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of <UNK> them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <UNK> , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the <UNK> kind . " She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <UNK> by any feeling of <UNK> . 22.405109104976116
Mr . Wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a <UNK> as she could . 14.431855555885466
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though <UNK> with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 11.648599620090458
No , never . 3.527559498846759
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <UNK> ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . 16.23725268370201
I had no notion but he would go a <UNK> , or something or other , and not <UNK> us with his company . 13.872832825571669
She performed her part indeed without much <UNK> , but Mrs . 14.631755579888415
you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 16.620266037093785
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . 10.294405001195177
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his <UNK> . 22.856336267836856
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 15.075219456607392
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to <UNK> people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? 15.41496232882545
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uncle Philips , <UNK> <UNK> wine , who followed them into the room . 19.50270997203326
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . " Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . 13.455904954988169
Miss Bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs . 11.230381440399613
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 9.77941402508452
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . 19.00280458822067
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . 13.221174601317836
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey . 15.692949764205897
Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . 14.817878010701172
I am quite well . 4.8646237702427895
" <UNK> Oh ! 10.079010633910077
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 16.643350860826224
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
It was really a very handsome thought . 7.664738538254725
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 15.916656708988867
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not <UNK> a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . 20.220901769248826
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . 8.411494626395333
They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy . 13.877913091953372
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . 12.259819891312333
Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . 11.024643863952141
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 14.835943149567138
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 11.361988909607536
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its <UNK> , to think of any thing else . 18.885931970578305
<UNK> will be absolutely <UNK> , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . 21.08995668516019
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia ' s marriage . 11.045619591672283
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? 10.008911506105083

She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in <UNK> ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs . 20.432555478300266

Mr . Bennet ' s <UNK> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! 15.353617637436953
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 16.35200772748254
" It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . 11.551595733851567
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and <UNK> to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head . 13.176187542465378
Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an <UNK> sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she <UNK> him . 14.468935500437937
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . " Miss Bennet eagerly <UNK> all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . 20.129065397884148
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 14.263163069620031
Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . " " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . " " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " I honour your circumspection . 10.314142937481154
This cannot be ! 6.522955264393273
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . 12.74183969417273
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at <UNK> ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . 19.38964356332965
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . 13.071683555442315
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 10.222829335394483
have you heard from my uncle ? " " Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . " " Well , and what news does it bring ? 9.79758387362322
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . 9.320193758376204
She opened the door , and met Maria in the <UNK> place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza ! 15.019880588244096
Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , <UNK> that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ? 15.175093605506108
Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the <UNK> of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . 15.090499017056805
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . 18.60849081467807
" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . 9.000181587476956

She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . 16.89669515699555
But that is not the case here . 5.7302918393301026
" Lizzy , you must not do so . 4.221512753713597
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a <UNK> denial , and ride off as fast as I could . " " Would Mr . Darcy then consider the <UNK> of your original intention as <UNK> for by your obstinacy in <UNK> to it ? " " Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . " " You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . 21.256875318895823

To the civil enquiries which then <UNK> in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer . 14.659584297949813
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . 11.808604252786171

Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . " " Are you quite sure , Ma ' am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said Jane . " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . " " Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . " " Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . 16.93639470845619
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character . 19.919806010283537
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <UNK> , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . 14.050663367910781
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 9.747319568937945
They must be a great loss to your family . " In Darcy ' s presence she dared not mention Wickham ' s name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <UNK> in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , <UNK> herself <UNK> to <UNK> the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . 27.634199303996684

The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 22.02611455544229
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified . 12.422200739810501

At length , she spoke again . 7.748170771951694
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my <UNK> and <UNK> are not usually <UNK> by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of <UNK> ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly .

Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented . 17.37680773266638
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 17.681449626121765
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 21.500899484602947

Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " I never heard that it was . " " And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . 15.434242196112093
In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 12.5679203228381
I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . " Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . 16.438672627599185
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 18.213566950229442

" I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends . 8.303708454474293
But here , by carrying with me one <UNK> source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <UNK> . 21.500134949619653

I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <UNK> in the gaieties which that season generally <UNK> , and that your <UNK> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall <UNK> you .

Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . 11.51653226084176
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 16.58595255635366
Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . 12.04726619637928
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 25.197855393977484

The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . 12.158206966307539
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . 14.314014425412397
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 26.111123167299052
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ? 9.537631425642276

They were natural and just . 7.095745645576806
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? 7.635724407881153
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away . 14.546502628422108

But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . 16.185873031864762
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . 14.165613510568738

It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . 10.807165184084212
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did . 14.641184318142304
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 3.957227749789039
in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 12.127198895345177
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 11.92683798734406

Bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at <UNK> , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to <UNK> you when your father is dead . I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . 13.617135950499797
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . 14.911772516285632
Her own thoughts were <UNK> her . 12.95631566716012

She was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . 18.149043427191227
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 19.292553421201998
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . " " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us . 17.924361591791104
Elizabeth , <UNK> all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . 13.700605740955607
Gardiner , though unknown . 6.035705805562197
It is impossible for me to be impartial . 7.945373212997277
That is all to be forgot . 6.553154224257011
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , c . 25.70535622940106
Lady Catherine was <UNK> proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her . 16.966423082828612
Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . 20.0653145898232
I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 14.148505826505225
Mr . Darcy replied with great <UNK> , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley . 8.738132782413723
Miss Bennet had <UNK> ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . 11.395681877074095
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " <UNK> you ! 11.131211300709953
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . 12.130461289426153
" Of a fine , stout , <UNK> love it may . 13.0802962107442
Yet he knew to the contrary himself . 9.13343704407499
Elizabeth immediately <UNK> the livery , guessed what it meant , and <UNK> no small degree of surprise to her relations , by <UNK> them with the honour which she expected . 21.5246835623377
Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at <UNK> , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs . 20.21534125442891
Bennet was <UNK> in her acknowledgments . 10.259685381814647
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . 14.872674428172528
She would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house . " Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer . 9.509845184890914
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious . 20.342909184384926
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 17.096707266081225
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . 14.212931103837787
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn house . 29.145835320015863
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . 13.807298522490377
Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . 14.22274262244981
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . 11.976601502565856
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . 11.462531098311874
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 9.664680330563268
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . 6.42311769263458
Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time . 14.607590894768453
Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane ' s ? 11.093079018906463
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? " " Most willingly . " " You shall have it in few words . 15.11527512403104
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 19.222177101201382
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . 21.211743148202217
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 10.341219126979405
Mr . Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . 9.407077511998976
Every thing that is charming ! 10.584567524694172
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . 14.790147814384449
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . 14.172958074424093
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . 14.216496346561822
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . 22.841499003804014
Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ? 19.86587505394672
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten . 9.561053160637664
Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> . 9.939717991887262
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 6.871619842696561
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . 19.406259921245216
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . 10.72858265112637
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . 11.162318889796564
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . 15.669745182117708
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 26.998654132352808
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ' s way . " Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <UNK> . 16.75979652500073
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by <UNK> a <UNK> , or covering a <UNK> . 30.093547011315863
" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! 8.224385214963352
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . 12.203479437899926
It will not do . 4.1863202147100615
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . 15.890997120279618
CHAPTER XI . 7.654260973594331
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . 14.5202104790041
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . 11.963517369056403
" You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . 11.22426819614243
It cannot last long . 7.211590001137012
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away . 9.188852884716887
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him . 6.9643695761967885
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <UNK> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . 22.667491369340752
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! 9.780908983349617
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them . " This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret . 15.424670859110684
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 11.813811249598611
do any thing rather than marry without affection . 12.987069747111514
CHAPTER II . 7.414109323913755
The Foundation is <UNK> to complying with the laws <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> donations in all states of the United States . 41.759667735591215
He takes them now for people of fashion . " The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she <UNK> a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his <UNK> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . 17.77770449638539
Have you seen any pleasant men ? 17.557967452772886
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . 18.92235555499022
" And this is always the way with him , " she added . " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . 8.80972595886797
I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 12.25244014892705
CHAPTER XIV . 7.654260973594331
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . 14.304449612657315
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . 12.17770637157762
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . 14.47476241053371
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . " " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . 12.45646965403082
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the <UNK> of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 16.16393024615421
<UNK> , teazing , man ! 10.568176119938268
Of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was <UNK> with admiration was evident enough . 19.00272852117565
" Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared . 8.526309947052285
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . 11.03733974342881
His attachment to Rosings , certainly <UNK> . " Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 13.490877638368827
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . 20.533563943245067
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . 25.89728684218071
Collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . 16.908210660767153
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . 14.905583752938625
yes ; there is nothing in that . 5.949105834515361
Have not you always hated him ? " How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! 23.907677178960256
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 18.376866569907854
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . 17.95405617810285
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . 7.992258609436487
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room . 11.908385097386093
At length Darcy spoke , and in a <UNK> manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . " " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with <UNK> , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . " Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . 17.851503740738952
On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . 14.275700739478372
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern . 13.172328241870591
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . 8.312551404836288
" Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . 10.422289347742142
His temptation is not <UNK> to the risk . " " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment . 14.752623648901427
I thought I should have broke my heart . " " I am sure I shall break mine , " said Lydia . 10.920323107328587
<UNK> sons cannot marry where they like . " " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . " " Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . " " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl ' s younger son ? 20.139262291577246
<UNK> it , Kitty ? " Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . 15.071495726784732
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . 31.437000550760228
Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 13.040950503895935
This match , to which you have the presumption to <UNK> , can never take place . 11.849192580874144
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , Mrs . 9.091884285495027
I am prodigiously proud of him . 7.688473443276373
Her <UNK> wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . 25.498302200748956
<UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill . 10.821163978783334
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . 12.036421581556759
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by <UNK> the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . 20.17573199234448
I can recal nothing worse . 11.607251540858568
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? 16.064339978929656
Give me farther particulars . 13.877985571944162
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . 16.298275693782344
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . 19.93810298506528
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " cried Elizabeth . 20.07627646739806
How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? " " That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . 14.020376548915463
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 9.413518592404225
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund . 21.781303781208422
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . " " What should not you mind ? " " I should not mind any thing at all . " " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . " " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail . 10.876008302236748
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . 12.472303317578568
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . 15.521184498889017
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 15.752518549856388
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . 17.15773282951827
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . 14.14768122273761
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . " Mrs . 10.859047067411604
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged . 16.1707979424795
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . 15.00464170395632
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , <UNK> to invite him to sit by herself . 19.848435934900536
Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . 22.852886590117738
I dearly love a laugh . " " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . 8.876544762922693
and it was not wholly without foundation . 7.3441014739414365
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 14.89584234190744
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side . 16.814357254774908
oh ! 7.872589422492765
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had . 11.741753109076582
How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr . Bingley ? " " Not at all . " " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . 13.677504868815118
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . 17.928167514414547
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 16.653808768915106
Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs . 7.724938288558234
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? 12.62451683097432
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 15.467093177723363
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will <UNK> you ; and so generous , that you will always <UNK> your income . " " I hope not so . 14.047043087539945
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 11.4993712745649
She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <UNK> him with fears and regrets in <UNK> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 14.157678164061775
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 19.06871737041268
but there were two or three much <UNK> in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to <UNK> it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . 23.53921328551495
CHAPTER XIX . 7.654260973594331
But I have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous <UNK> , boy in the world . " Elizabeth almost stared at her . " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she . 16.737445018186975
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its <UNK> was visiting and news . 15.885651209100173
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of <UNK> in that way . 15.310843280710435
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . " Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs . 8.77081990231112
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 10.931268529552932
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world . 12.5582318076616
Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 13.336665441469835
Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . 10.522347870153121
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in <UNK> it after this explanation . " Mr . Darcy , who was <UNK> against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . 20.653325984097332
Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age . 15.332713324040068
Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . 4.0354443396512165
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . 12.914876069931088
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . 10.8915790408666
CHAPTER XVII . 7.654260973594331
Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 12.56433420084139
Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to <UNK> it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . 17.646866278824113
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 17.361711551002116
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . " " I should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother . 13.438512155507691
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs . 8.177756383627134
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 19.855610090168856
She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband . 11.559176835882363
What are we to do ! " would they often <UNK> in the bitterness of <UNK> . 15.187909293559605
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? 18.055146847405716
They crossed it by a <UNK> bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a <UNK> , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the <UNK> <UNK> wood which bordered it . 31.696556423443297
It was a large , well <UNK> room , handsomely fitted up . 16.876834044906797
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . 13.182659239221994
But your arts and <UNK> may , in a moment of <UNK> , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . 14.209447779101904
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . 14.365728004552674
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 10.120891433964605
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr . Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . 24.037227686747045
<UNK> him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her . 23.97154295866408
Had his character been known , this could not have happened . 9.48992934136799
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? 15.818711741877797
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent . 19.86364270040131
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . " To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . 20.212553237096845
Who would have thought it ! 8.805825533854488
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at Longbourn . 20.26347295888401
" My dear <UNK> , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of <UNK> each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s t te t te between two women can never end without a quarrel . 24.981258555549463
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . 9.974554216631386
Mr . what ' s his name . 4.8025697465352515
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . 17.179459446424787
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . 10.062532838698454
She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . 21.595426222027953
They agree with me in <UNK> that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the <UNK> of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself <UNK> says , will connect themselves with such a family . 20.50525080000869
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 13.797600596542768
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission . 9.345671984510545
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . 15.87099391347618
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . 11.773431184909246
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . 12.755943931763138
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 17.976852360031007
Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 17.134763343818815
But it is so strange ! " " Yes that is what makes it amusing . 11.452946843229487
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . 13.356350785369822
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . 13.301146643370366
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? " " One of them does . " " Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . 20.585746134595137
" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your <UNK> appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . " " Oh ! 19.9343792626848
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . 14.24462798588128
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 12.605665561285747
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 12.169902678707837
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 13.094941773808957
But she is nothing to me now . 5.0597353660790425
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or <UNK> distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more <UNK> blind . 27.534016511732812
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 15.40819619142668
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . 14.550630985936378
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one <UNK> in it an object of compassion , while they are <UNK> of our intimacy at Rosings . " <UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> . 23.20426684734904
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in <UNK> to the proposal before him . 10.643279792474019
Hill and the two <UNK> . 9.73944713907393
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <UNK> , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 16.63278926028613
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man . 21.20334817744516
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 17.359804850917747
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . 21.802085788113004
" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . 4.777250932177467
" And pray may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a <UNK> tone , " Is it in address that he improves ? 18.208260722009967
She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . 14.305061216249845
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . 11.173064571750997
came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the <UNK> , and at the <UNK> in Barnet and <UNK> , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . 21.404413987536582
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . 16.69316661778186
Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . " " To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart . 15.014268696325283
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 19.558744932901817
On finding Mrs . 7.925981569472328
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 15.024976576771826
Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 19.743959700817964
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . 18.04216439424188
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party . 13.631874466081614
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . 16.9974322323444
How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . 11.427026225032025
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my <UNK> . " " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . 16.206923965928013
You <UNK> me for coming ? " " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you . 16.60435645299474
what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . 11.885128008192494
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which were scattered over the <UNK> lawn . 44.64990306187024
Her colour changed , and she said no more . 8.573152275270054
Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a <UNK> over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was <UNK> Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <UNK> . 16.386862810389122
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <UNK> , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 12.116329747543706
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 14.549380070134722
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it . 8.988241230274982
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . 10.285809424949292
" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs . 10.541975430375903
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my <UNK> from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . 26.440730969169934
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . " " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . " " I beg your pardon . 8.02339178351514
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 17.239091770690827
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the coachman ' s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs . 21.018388004361938
You must and shall be married by a special licence . 13.257149831204796
I thought I should have died . 7.090091620962213
" <UNK> Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at <UNK> , if the drawing room were larger ; but <UNK> is too far off ! 19.655105191799446
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 12.145837723152162
This room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . 16.71146081408463
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . 15.280672460795662
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . 9.077253119665484
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . 16.60095174752003
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is <UNK> . " " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs . 11.474903298181562
For God ' s sake , say no more of his partners . 13.774463260372691
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word . 13.210524689373337
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . 12.184795211836862
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <UNK> of my son in law . 16.418826001337568
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most . 9.286908976458479
CHAPTER XIV . 7.654260973594331
" Mrs . 2.2731338070496614
Do not let us quarrel about the past . 15.783837814336016
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . 10.14510296808062
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 20.549746016261224
With many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs . 18.95314383085596
They will never be distressed for money . 10.031980825779561
" You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . 5.819134674329914
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from <UNK> in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death <UNK> of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and <UNK> as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly <UNK> her father not to let her go . 17.57133221426585
It was first broken by Mrs . 8.161544906305652
" And that , " said Mrs . 3.300185909910317
I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 10.395256429860188
Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend . 8.139183301120218
She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent . 9.977831998179063
<UNK> the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it cannot be long . " He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . 18.935286023009194
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . 13.814657092887344
" He seems to be a most <UNK> and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so <UNK> as to let him come to us again . " " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . " " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . " Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of <UNK> , marrying , and <UNK> his <UNK> whenever it were required . 19.70668797187018
Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . 9.283072759319895
Hurst began again . 7.233954746514556
The hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . 16.407635091803602
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . 16.933008717896335
We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 11.76667782267987
CHAPTER V . 7.65426164366213
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 14.163068858735329
" Then , who taught you ? 8.072392389469277
Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . 13.634591292091066
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . 7.902943988028794
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 14.97739099145776
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 18.957963709451594
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . 7.271516314219725
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can ' t write ; so I will <UNK> , and you write for me . 11.180935344394147
Believe her to be deceived by all means . 9.078125738221283
You supposed more than really existed . 14.23435243557686
At length however Mrs . 8.711669983942501
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . " Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . 14.730611297966734
" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! 11.746308481146974
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . 16.201066699188466
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , <UNK> Lucases . 18.482831119466663
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short <UNK> . " " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . 14.104697718812185
" And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! 8.066234228280296
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill <UNK> of Lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . 20.535778697727668
Collins ' s <UNK> of meat were too large for her family . 15.050134097402355
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . 15.574230646471582
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing room . 14.762813470087366
What are you telling Miss Bennet ? 11.800684167285583
Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . " After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! 18.065444545311756
If he had been <UNK> before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity <UNK> could make him . 16.803045562829624
He replied , and was again silent . 5.56857537232112
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 13.39551430342211
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . 8.062500674958597
I knew how it would be . 5.089890410425343
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 20.775409298401804
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added <UNK> to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be <UNK> . 19.876472811409922
" She is so fond of Mrs . 5.333574409473939
Wickham ! 3.926139718481435
Bennet was restored to her usual <UNK> serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the <UNK> office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton . 27.75613050653771
If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession . 26.238109583503554
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 12.968692354743418
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . 11.63929984184689
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 11.008692683983586
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ? 22.514798840007515
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! 20.501975916953338
" This is wholly unexpected . 8.718364384119672
Mr . Collins ! " " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . 9.519843742874942
" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . 11.29056428979686
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <UNK> and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " Wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of accents , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right . 19.463101242014428
Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . 10.078944649935018
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . 9.33941067159849
In pompous <UNK> on his side , and civil <UNK> on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton . 22.649249047777065
Your ' s , very sincerely , " <UNK> . 8.34721923876837
" He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . 7.996723518545574
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first <UNK> his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . 17.03316020967941
In a <UNK> voice Mrs . 12.577740563814478
" I do not get on at all . 4.836882672395973
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 22.537044471336337
Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 10.89270115060277
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . 17.038488607960282
She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most <UNK> by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . 13.19474326756856
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . " Elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! 16.857563454982042
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . " " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! 13.706050621177202
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . " " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth <UNK> ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy ' s steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself . " " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a <UNK> . 15.031576513334194
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 16.732690714998345
One must speak a little , you know . 7.215520141530371
<UNK> as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . 18.055110784246658
I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . 14.571100270865568
Mr . Bennet protested against any description of finery . 14.004287300822446
" He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . 12.957237273620288
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . " " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . 16.572371833515664
do not repeat what I then said . 7.695305454894424
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . 21.04442491724009
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 8.65725387165675
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the <UNK> old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . 15.177922646887232
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of <UNK> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . 18.470931147847992
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . 15.30468663358493
CHAPTER XI . 7.654260973594331
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . 11.942661178637794
My feelings in every respect forbid it . 11.734643344800025
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Mr . Robinson . " " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? 17.108958124314118
Elizabeth merely <UNK> to him , without saying a word . 11.2262993073193
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <UNK> . 18.262208211713492
The <UNK> or <UNK> of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining <UNK> . 35.95036823335389
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to <UNK> , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to <UNK> his prosperous love . 28.04854210514973
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 16.947259521721406
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his <UNK> to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm . 17.672944205542006
If a woman <UNK> her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . 17.582318688363163
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? 11.649207685108317
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs . 16.860831903034367
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in <UNK> affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? 17.679528984117603
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . 9.646808956634736
They are wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? " " They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . " " But if you have got them to day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered . " She did at last <UNK> from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . 13.89627888487766
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 17.44097103115059
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 10.86785791519473
Does he know his real character ? " " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . 13.289937142355521
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 17.986293984062552
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 12.527598672662366
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . 8.168494400418908
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . " Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less <UNK> of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too <UNK> by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . 17.101160725858875
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . 16.557817645257543
As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it <UNK> and lovely as ever . 17.254049942406482
" You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 9.693415889694093
Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her <UNK> and <UNK> , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with Miss Bennet . 19.222931972743773
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . " Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . 15.258953591723976
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to <UNK> these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 16.69399768083797
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners <UNK> respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 18.916013854739564
In the hall they parted . 9.09142624420601
CHAPTER VI . 7.65426164366213
Their table was <UNK> stupid . 20.69516711195941
" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face . 8.234450272881453
Lord ! 6.441258020886149
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 13.334450155180427
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . 24.023624196562
So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 18.64626047143678
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs . 7.611118254499169
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s . 15.745432291204233
He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . 16.737726400106297
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 13.80227860309484
Thank Heaven ! 13.256940674358882
Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party . 11.29898291627017
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and <UNK> , though <UNK> families . 17.55836995462847
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she <UNK> in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . 20.128912726670375
There can be no occasion for your going so soon . 10.562003933966924
In a few minutes , Mrs . 6.271908500971806
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 28.99805835395938
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one <UNK> idea of any thing . 16.9087133258643
You are so strange ! 9.277631506730929
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . 13.491658784728546
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very <UNK> in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . 16.42168864108094
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> . 24.898574367649935
" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said Mr . Gardiner . 7.449415916507996
When Mrs . 3.9006976406302294
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her <UNK> . 19.860869096106114
who attended to you ? 5.847361036572065
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> . 12.36766733399579
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? 12.423607658072623
Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with <UNK> civility that they were perfectly needless . 17.913017262133675
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it . 29.811371698564937
Their first subject was the <UNK> of the Rosings party . " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . 13.033766764356276
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 17.879073491908123
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 8.926930102066247
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . " " If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . 15.126867917499904
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . 18.5691751314611
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and Mrs . 16.613022545202305
" I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . 7.276065832422073
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 7.272623491376898
Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described . 7.016392354811888
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . 9.897381086903643
Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . 12.308768942281239
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other . 10.684405725654996
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 19.700902730394898
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over <UNK> evils , or <UNK> them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . 20.520447745065884
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 17.593926074342985
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . 20.668258664881705
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . 19.94895682450885
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . 13.340864710789802
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . 13.603266384714006
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 9.127030407821119
She longed to see Mrs . 6.737106195463772
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . 16.13778593698237
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so . 11.078661015306261
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . 15.31843314219732
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 25.033929914798602
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . 10.723629585853548
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . <UNK> are never of so much consequence to a father . 13.30536357193111
Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . 12.816484143176227
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 11.453039903246712
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room . 13.382238697722892
I know it to be impossible . " " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! 9.465304023649098
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions . 18.939092144363396
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 21.1585329972142
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? 16.576777263662454
" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But now we may be silent . " " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " Sometimes . 23.23017125015667
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew . 7.626856894606576
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . 15.910134988190276
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . " " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were <UNK> and insolent . 12.636847951474454
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 9.610257629010093
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry <UNK> , his wife may teach him . 18.397324752973983
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of <UNK> , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 21.128091459766786
Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active <UNK> , and when immediately before my father ' s death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . " " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth . 14.833870387974937
Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . 10.293000359619207
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . 14.198210566448038
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 17.14346917359255
I must have employment and society . 7.077995151430774
what news ? 6.346930423251119
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , soon collected them round the table . 20.789759735393837
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . " Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . 17.049697504830146
It was then <UNK> in the following manner . 10.883006599387514
Bennet give up the point . 6.493424415488113
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . 21.035222114318
" My aunt , " she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor street . " She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley . 11.363429311877423
She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 20.33763644500464
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! 18.11363087104004
The party did not supply much conversation . 11.716685717775466
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation . 18.613383725012692
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . 15.410115379048534
" It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . 6.139367504621671
Pray do not talk of that odious man . 11.530048011762364
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 11.427642955827224
Every thing <UNK> what is strong already . 21.370480346796374
" How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet ! 5.60365753105523
Most people start at our Web site which has the <UNK> <UNK> search <UNK> www . gutenberg . org This Web site <UNK> information about Project Gutenberg tm , including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation , how to help produce our new eBooks , and how to <UNK> to our <UNK> <UNK> to hear about new eBooks . 75.72867010139748
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> . 16.098105952072338
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should <UNK> . 13.782966871727051
If you are outside the United States , check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before <UNK> , copying , displaying , performing , distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg tm work . 35.406866005239074
But however he did not . 4.898439032328028
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 12.321129834985276
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <UNK> them . 8.7169152759466
It is really too distressing . 9.652623409074288
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of <UNK> and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 22.646457167288418
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ' s . 12.868768207864582
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 11.192890851670473
But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . 5.610566864579454
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance <UNK> , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . 21.213144362543005
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <UNK> her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 14.603192340903815
Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . " Then addressing her daughter , " Oh ! 14.322042309413089
Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . 8.06972075177026
Then pray speak aloud . 17.058823873407075
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 20.048722123235123
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , <UNK> , manner of talking to her brother . 16.152191017696502
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 14.270143254073997
It must be his own doing . He is his own master . 9.14270537821349
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their <UNK> concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 16.743788980022092
Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . 18.084705366743087
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . " She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . 18.342110022819497
" You forget that I have made no answer . 7.633745247630511
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . 14.272188535006622
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . 18.81519066905726
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . 13.274453030896535
No , no , you shall not deceive me . 6.4869502740698275
His surprise was great . 6.612144523903645
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . 17.6891367059291
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 7.925863908642895
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday . 21.39338504218924
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . 17.53924237617236
And pray what sort of <UNK> do you make ? 18.622670957286243
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " <UNK> so I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . 12.259337944704294
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . 12.860675427241436
Lydia was Lydia still ; <UNK> , <UNK> , wild , noisy , and <UNK> . 17.043587159242087
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . 13.193012672806685
The moral will be perfectly fair . 12.750274557611737
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost . 12.001181782115195
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . " " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be . 12.404715399334462
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . " Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . 6.169645361485946
Bennet , " to walk to <UNK> Mount this morning . 10.57142725878183
Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 14.726254588686839
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . 16.045194738081772
Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . " " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . 12.22849043201006
Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 11.710971826724276
It is what every body says . 9.297850596596158
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . 9.95482984237821
" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <UNK> , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss <UNK> ' s . " " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . " " Oh ! 19.187406919736304
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . 11.242528964407272
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 13.409751818035414
That he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . 10.760980860377432
Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs . 9.651044415649686
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . 15.03159610072138
Bennet and the children . 3.7660402457055846
What are men to <UNK> and mountains ? 19.188745040630806
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <UNK> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . 17.983310753353116
Are the <UNK> of Pemberley to be thus <UNK> ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . 16.883072713347627
I do not wish to avoid the walk . 6.370950153302918
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <UNK> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . 17.804724650218112
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <UNK> , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 22.660728193288286
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <UNK> on such a research ; in which <UNK> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally <UNK> , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . 20.853463019962245
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . 8.70350178624124
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . 8.849056756648064
You must not disappoint your father . " " My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . " " Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . " " Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . 11.513913094169785
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 15.9107384142116
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . 11.573635675781121
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 20.1319975225241
She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs . 6.519177192180563
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . 8.79817859951058
Jane was by no means better . 6.6262804621247815
He was <UNK> his memory with <UNK> and noble names . 25.891816183073953
I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . 11.355240019427875
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent <UNK> of <UNK> on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . 19.287177058887696
From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . 11.424260789046418
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! 25.330049197304724
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went <UNK> against the <UNK> ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <UNK> <UNK> , and give the praise where it was due . 22.113942243598284
But though every thing seemed <UNK> and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <UNK> ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . 19.269042716609803
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . " " I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 11.85622122672364
He has heartily <UNK> me now . " Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . 21.08541560336556

And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 14.048243823981991
Not all that Mrs . 4.946861062301541
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . " <UNK> by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did . 15.798690878876375
After a slight <UNK> for good news , the letter was read aloud . 17.231978476251214
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company . 9.33120360580382
For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently . 16.45544991516293
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . 13.52279458957048
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ' s folly . " " Indeed you are mistaken . 21.476392472662006
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 8.227668257869487
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy . 16.208513138593798
It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . 10.634669009643515
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 13.4357483388959
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . 17.485007506307
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an <UNK> of Mr . Darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . 16.99364397659419
I dare say the <UNK> upon Mrs . 11.538713046055465
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 9.781005789999163
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most <UNK> character ! 14.256979568998862
I am perfectly satisfied . 6.34427603774991
Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . 15.761938871187686
Forster , the delight of Mrs . 4.5470735262460655
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . " The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they <UNK> satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had <UNK> Mrs . 16.387239857578972
" Oh ! " said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . 8.001319261597557
Elizabeth silently attended her . 8.034700273150486
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply <UNK> on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . 25.344518154427526
What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! 12.585639128167864
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 16.918524952022036
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . 14.548826344356748
They agreed that Mrs . 6.478924360410365
Why should they try to influence him ? 13.934299824573671
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . 11.331554588994948
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 8.491702772123263
It would have suited me in every respect . " " How should you have liked making sermons ? " " <UNK> well . 16.7636380988833
From that moment I observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 17.363749081679845
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 18.15014047152896
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all <UNK> , was still <UNK> <UNK> . 16.80132462667666
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged <UNK> of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . 22.06348628721148
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . 17.227597760788726
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . 12.212635830780263
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 9.309876935060153
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation . 12.391388134075711
But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . " " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . " Elizabeth made no answer . 11.885005752519877
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . 11.171085156092243
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 15.250410164338712
It is almost past belief . 11.938688202943576
such an openness and gentleness in his manner . " " There certainly was some great <UNK> in the education of those two young men . 17.696710090288292
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side . 19.339468905509797
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . 11.084171171565375
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . 8.611826071941856
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . " " But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . " " Let me be rightly understood . 17.032262303447077
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . Oh ! 20.28833547885945
<UNK> has she condescended to give me her opinion <UNK> too ! on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our <UNK> at quadrille , while Mrs . 25.711153769429067
Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! 14.031883980442375
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 13.160684945703363
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . 16.048369719948887
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 6.9974018890399385

" Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss Bingley ; " and pray what is the result ? " " I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect . 10.844925023671383
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . 9.340146205110702
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! <UNK> our surprise . 20.332828421727985
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 19.6276617031146
Bennet with civil self command to Miss Lucas . 13.335118692240066
Did you see it ? " Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . 8.729137634064935
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your ' s seems to have been . 15.052173419624594
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! 12.210933080019194
Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in <UNK> , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and <UNK> a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire . 20.111859697995236
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . " " You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . 13.132501100976727
But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . 19.4532151119675
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> . 29.802755717710568
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 11.350856123459451
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . 15.060888806099673
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 8.704481031770868
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . " " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . 10.825118592771332
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 17.84115042094511
Her ladyship was highly incensed . 14.06099020092306
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . 16.653381553850732
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ' s visit . 15.19641472776201
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . " From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . 15.537051732621325
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 11.591666529201383
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 13.148694043781093
yes I understand you perfectly . " " I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . " " That is as it happens . 13.314950090122698
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . 14.417429248691047
And is it really true ? 9.4588767263928
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . 13.680077290882451
She saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . 17.18621018140652
It is useless to talk of it . " It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . 13.140096754854488
At five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . 27.63189501990172
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . 12.662701870901783
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy ' s regard . " " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? " " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . " " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy . 11.629349441744791
At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . " With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 21.798563371749935
She practises very constantly . " " So much the better . 11.297259873790766
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . 9.48270015579712
Charles , when you <UNK> your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 13.279006459498016
Every thing being settled between them , Mr . Darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home . 16.047842484837165
Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the <UNK> ? 18.163769186033168
Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . 9.348876534123809
" Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " I have , Sir . " " Very well . 8.679408058465805
And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined . 13.791085577083901
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . 10.759805648817604
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " " <UNK> do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 19.824863069797555
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 13.070008561181362
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . 14.614534902182479
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . 6.282263211465091
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . 13.562693104635116
c . " Mr . Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . 13.010968899926757
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was <UNK> her feelings in <UNK> on Elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . 18.800584808053674
I told Mrs . 3.897590109432065
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter . 17.84568658449495
" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs . 9.074305077933388
By tea time however the <UNK> had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . 16.34113612434456
no it is not for me to be driven away by Mr . Darcy . 6.561940715003654
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being <UNK> dressed . 14.790232310951072
is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must <UNK> us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . " Then shewing her purchases " <UNK> here , I have bought this bonnet . 21.535757452931108
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 8.763799782246268
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 11.134081502067824
She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . 11.504625745780965
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . 10.556261567846335
He is gone to my father already . 7.811989767234233
Philips . The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . 12.534131703096032
are quite well . " " But you How are you ? " cried Elizabeth . 6.979230412124631
Bennet was <UNK> engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <UNK> them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather <UNK> than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . 19.717918786911724
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . " " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 10.267843844954458
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 18.627015780649447
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so <UNK> with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and <UNK> of her own family ! 17.022251916697194
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 13.217434229339796
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so <UNK> to you . 22.55342057805101
" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . 11.352555693842932
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of <UNK> them . 14.996114670945992
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 19.506645094000326
They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . 11.84398173131039
" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . 12.267898427193195
There is one point , on which I want your advice . 9.880460748040267
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . 14.611630500255593
I do not deserve it . 5.051854499856289
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 18.47512285048306
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater <UNK> concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being <UNK> by <UNK> , <UNK> inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . 31.941968739418343
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " " But I was embarrassed . " " And so was I . " " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " " A man who had felt less , might . " " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 11.806026878649073
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , <UNK> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 19.83680450481844
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia ' s leaving home . 16.108600772126547
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her <UNK> , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . 14.087939842804394
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , <UNK> , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . 29.730292712788057
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
I am so pleased so happy . 6.724564071496704
We were always good friends ; and now we are better . " " True . 10.602757607335134
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 17.77054365778047
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure . " The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs . 23.374928891445048
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 7.652925622577678
" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be <UNK> , for <UNK> I must call it . " " It is wonderful , " replied Wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 15.196401675217368
Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the <UNK> and smiles of the whole party . 16.492196364139517
But now it comes out . " " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows . 11.39004086249582
He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would <UNK> more birds on the first of <UNK> , than any body else in the country . 16.023792988360242
Only look at her . 6.675890596923678
Her mother <UNK> <UNK> , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 24.164668585676726
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . 13.822243802413416
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . 11.549477409838941
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 8.076688331372614
This is your <UNK> resolve ! 21.56537001687143
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 12.576580712193373
" Kitty and I are going <UNK> to sit in my dressing room . " Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room . 15.86679588091751
<UNK> and <UNK> I can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart . 30.2946697562355
With <UNK> tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of <UNK> that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . 17.474675086386405
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed . 17.734380976540326
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . 12.887849825324784
Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . 10.219877563972592
They must have seen them together for ever . " " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . 15.661622579128109
It is of all subjects my delight . 8.134677392517926
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 13.020198378902442
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 17.625176365582096
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 16.746004262707697
Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 15.21533026679173
Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began . 20.2911505958597
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 16.905489077510367
Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <UNK> . 19.065325226579407
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 11.12726261158389
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 16.218339742078452
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very <UNK> reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to <UNK> and <UNK> to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 18.02248501335978
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation . 17.34534788677441
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 10.442887645110495
Why does she not come in ? " " Oh ! 8.52919286738997
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 10.113160364054373
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . 19.16262716921692
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . 10.52681128644012
Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 8.750502683188103
Long has promised to introduce him . " " I do not believe Mrs . 8.7719153091809
He drew a chair near her . 10.513657602354982
But I will no longer <UNK> my young cousin . " Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his <UNK> at backgammon . 18.778322974514964
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 16.742020511502368
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 12.449560726783826
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 11.987147840774517
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <UNK> to that evening , " said Elizabeth . 12.521874308830174
CHAPTER XVII . 7.654260973594331
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest . 13.121024504810324
Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? 10.574275079659778
Bingley and talked of Mrs . 4.363691824974389
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s <UNK> . 15.180234454748081
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . 8.096705165910718
" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? " Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . 24.508684501940483
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . 9.125141679512737
The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . 23.53702155646049
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can ' t think . 16.302915135633096
The dejection was almost universal . 13.887920892364974
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished . 16.13473502734297
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 6.143652189632963
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 22.76511657610502
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . " " I see no occasion for that . 9.952031979554665
She will follow wherever Lydia leads . 18.70353996287365
" Oh ! 3.9535946941154325
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . 12.538936566506697
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . 8.102766357005772
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day . " " Oh , yes . 11.91461052017562
" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . 13.103021930521749
It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . 18.515864050956168
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . " " You are over <UNK> surely . 11.791170602700788
Long . 3.874480542123758
" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . 8.179349038684833
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an <UNK> with her brother for talking such nonsense . 21.16700400172528

I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . 12.649058804546312
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder . 21.161358401375274
Your idea of the ponies is delightful . 10.764145039382402
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 15.34982056747644
She had high <UNK> spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . 18.447716771662233
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . 10.29406004489185
" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . 10.527533954243056

The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . " " Indeed ! " " Yes the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> . 16.589767595836985
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . 5.612559613727396
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she <UNK> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . 20.381248671469212
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the <UNK> of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . 15.707719397968809
Gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , <UNK> of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 14.523993149275938
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 9.96281585885105
" I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 10.64380202226815
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 22.674409169359393
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . " " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . 13.552974141612276
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 11.785082473464604
How much sooner one <UNK> of any thing than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . " No one made any reply . 16.51114338569814
The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who <UNK> it , were familiar to them . 16.39103223232201
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . " Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . 21.54539841867598
I will speak to her about it myself directly . 7.457250163946899
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . 8.938262776805562
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? 11.962101343382601
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s <UNK> name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father ' s estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think . 17.8125888968103
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 22.081302511680924
" What could he mean ? 7.167210173611202
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 13.277692990591856
Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . 9.238444847155401
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs . 13.170006594249388
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 9.649644004455942
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , <UNK> love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means <UNK> , though it could not be exactly defined . 16.373897264038675
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year . 24.742524593726845
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . " " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? " " Dearest Jane ! 17.224002763281828
I am not equal to it . 4.121595088158138
Gardiner . 2.8792509164189544
" Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? 10.201046164288714
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . 11.832006094129062
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been <UNK> by long expectations . 12.542144542183301
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . 13.39359035411054
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
He owns it himself without disguise . " " No " said Darcy , " I have made no such pretension . 11.462037669732144
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton . 22.15391870406702
Her cousin <UNK> his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the <UNK> of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . " It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . 14.192622013416306
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . 8.927070004620358
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her <UNK> spirits , and of teaching her that her present <UNK> are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 13.970157111584182
Why must she be <UNK> about the country , because her sister had a cold ? 14.465039232250295
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell . 14.687832253787612
I am very glad you liked her . 6.669453279411235
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 14.929845119405943
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy . 22.154992016981673
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . " CHAPTER V . 26.515971405163082
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else ! 8.976022408872574
My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them . 18.62615566565738
Elizabeth was <UNK> enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 11.302347469618395
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate . 14.613999066854808
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . 13.446241396503668
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . 12.111726843188821
No , no , let me <UNK> for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret . 12.354497012039515
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . 19.687814905670567
Long and the Gouldings soon . 7.832773859581765
She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . 19.5958155852585
CHAPTER XVIII . 7.654262124377574
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . 14.16441038121776
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . 22.886863641983382
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . 11.818310810504014
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry . 12.07527087419352
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . 15.673618351289628
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 16.02431554448982
Not these two or three years perhaps . " " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can . 12.234929698395218
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . 8.567496086121643
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? 7.777649838661522
And for this we are to be thankful . 7.369949334989969
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of <UNK> , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . 18.95113946212024
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 13.973639738075672
You know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . 12.65280272114301
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry <UNK> , a very mean art . " " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is <UNK> in all the arts which ladies sometimes <UNK> to employ for <UNK> . 20.214860202564736
They have at least that advantage . " " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . 11.636218166264676
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . 15.08785723628567
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 20.731681707344848
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips . 23.423756760395193
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . 9.954887302241964
has she any family ? " " She has one only daughter , the <UNK> of Rosings , and of very extensive property . " " Ah ! " cried Mrs . 11.168467947661554
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . 17.428741152480733
F . 3.8355300083888526
Gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the <UNK> fashions . 18.10482809103252
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . " Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . 14.431514201704356
how can it affect them ? " " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! 10.800090866273122
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 19.06871737041268
Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the <UNK> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . 16.653622836408065
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . 12.490561033440999
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 4.691756752455979
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . 11.777626373484015
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . 13.228095356838894
He seldom appeared really animated . 18.529065073746963
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . 20.939202911312872
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <UNK> every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were <UNK> abroad . 41.50219959537582
Make haste , and come down this moment . " Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . 23.31195266435284
Wickham is safe . " " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . " " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane . 14.994176181435682
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished <UNK> of integrity or benevolence , that might <UNK> him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the <UNK> of virtue , atone for those <UNK> errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . 28.287279574569254
His <UNK> to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 11.136465406450089
Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . 10.617028387312125
" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself . 12.026313545032398
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . 12.32897239674274
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had <UNK> time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 13.830569041545164
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 8.454220380260725
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 7.941011083685876
" He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . 16.341801189986082
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . 17.239066932518114
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . 18.85033265089703
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . 14.438964674192128
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ? 14.34107777131558
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . 14.017199469655333
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . 29.62717994767933
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 14.338842072971701
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 16.212319117653763
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 13.3371081659719
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile it was decided . 14.64076352878209
In Lydia ' s imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of <UNK> happiness . 22.44365087565523
Lady Catherine de Bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . 15.117982450373324
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . " " No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me . 10.336282567974786
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 12.541739294355773
But you know married women have never much time for writing . 12.992801497661272
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s . 7.351080199762637
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 15.213635311864262
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! 13.557263498438562
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 30.047811825580915
<UNK> was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . 13.492075314125788
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . 11.612495022777768
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . 6.733238912184136
" You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . 13.50300385277116
Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . 13.428148833194946
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 13.32356970042079
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 16.12199299027274
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might <UNK> to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . 17.58030387525017
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . 12.922348281723142
CHAPTER XIX . 7.654260973594331
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself . 8.458915708822826
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the <UNK> of a considerable <UNK> , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . 30.285711037185067
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . 12.7879909500023
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . " " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley . 17.85265050340494
Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very <UNK> too for it is provoking me to <UNK> , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly . 12.61991329935168
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? 16.197221117276836
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so <UNK> . 13.786434310671988
Heaven forbid ! 13.90973858986548
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 10.761124956386542
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 15.078317351861347
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . " Hunsford , near <UNK> , Kent , th <UNK> . DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . " There , Mrs . 22.67943263192502
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . 21.63604826670274
See paragraph . E below . 17.6117274630106
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 15.285653011872146
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 19.141408454328296
There was also a postscript to this effect . 11.119602299814165
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . 10.361259347822351
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . 15.755904144752495
<UNK> me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . " Elizabeth could not refuse , though she <UNK> little pleasure in the visit . 11.495508949746744
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 17.270559298609683
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . 13.428724195859475
Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . 11.462842743051946
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . 11.68257636503064
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 10.69495508266734
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . 10.365375377815251
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 10.44886073998707
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 14.34564345386924
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . 9.775177777565034
But gracious me ! 8.500737934097726
Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated . 23.082855434203623
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . 10.272182803775737
She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <UNK> in so small a family as her ' s , and <UNK> her as to the care of her <UNK> and her poultry . 17.36909932490868
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly <UNK> . 17.62060383127592
One day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . 13.97838739560696
He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 10.375086992292992
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
How odious I should think them ! " " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " " I am afraid you do not like your pen . 12.808721678572757
Nothing could be more delightful ! 11.102702511281178
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 19.411423058887422
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 7.368301562796207
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 20.74209112710334
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child . 16.10110159372789
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on . 19.511877698537404
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 17.584493736797246
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . 13.252182646725162
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your <UNK> . " " I should imagine not . " " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . 15.803972405596914
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . 9.33186133238094
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 17.431122434320336
I told my sister Philips so the other day . 8.201425710705319
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . 14.359770923255185
" Excuse my interference . It was kindly meant . " " <UNK> girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . 17.65453437659837
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object . 9.563043627270396
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
But pride where there is a real <UNK> of mind , pride will be always under good <UNK> . " Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . 22.179495637875974
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <UNK> , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the <UNK> way for happiness . 19.54214693921872
<UNK> laws in most <UNK> are in a constant state of change . 25.63717031870458
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed ! 21.343752359105725
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 8.775786911934334
But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 14.959187277719492
I have not been in the habit of <UNK> disappointment . " " That will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . " " I will not be interrupted . 13.296064454590937
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law . " The loss of her daughter made Mrs . 18.393656067355256
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . " " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . 15.559837008315014
Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and <UNK> its extent . 25.30181532858797
She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece . 19.381391432349265
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . 11.409013785780488
There was no help for it however . 7.048646422988559
" Oh ! 3.9535946941154325
Not handsome enough to dance with ! 11.84696624260861
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and <UNK> of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their <UNK> . 24.27286921085521
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . 18.685509172303913
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can <UNK> so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most <UNK> to a <UNK> ' s mind . 23.572789840157252
Two <UNK> , however , were plainly <UNK> from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been <UNK> used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 18.192444240886267
and so extremely accomplished for her age ! 11.613743296407213
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 18.211982353266553
<UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> . 17.406606362919394
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 10.76310003221769
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . 13.66451744831969
U . S . laws alone <UNK> our small <UNK> . 43.819676111523044
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . 13.772297565767214
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 10.29808504625201
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! 11.45955923696207
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . 12.50866137118896
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 12.85822065711153
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to <UNK> her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever <UNK> . 16.88809293013198
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
But make a virtue of it by all means . 7.663862785489573
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . 11.11480081138744
Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 10.243505426649579
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon . 19.24026013096823
<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 12.072789682576133
Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 15.973576476260092
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s <UNK> . 19.47053922273918
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 13.253512277760116
But that is nothing to us . 4.714693407837474
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 13.047759859358322
My affections and wishes are <UNK> , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . " Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very <UNK> , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . 18.57557770575101
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , <UNK> , absurd . 20.680113379666693
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . 19.253099833095586
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . " Mrs . 12.03901900944098
The Foundation makes no <UNK> concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States . 39.5012765639662
It was in the <UNK> and the <UNK> , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . 8.22219629796694
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 35.460672003504506
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . 13.014700771293231
Mr . Bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . 22.49991127009152
" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the <UNK> <UNK> above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <UNK> than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . 21.058463068264896
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before . 20.18522826872494
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 10.622797375449606
I thank you for explaining it so fully . 11.604148053744213
One seems so <UNK> without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth . 11.11344549687154
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 17.73976059218192

In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 18.888316525014336
She comes to us to day . 6.2146735295579125
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <UNK> for Mr . Darcy ' s pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham . 20.838638973838968

The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . 21.858171371694446
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels . 23.593251208849935
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 11.553367380211965
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . 20.90340424570638
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 15.165167032230833
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . 14.24261709863251
Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . 6.933807933278774
To Mrs . 4.111893520695789
They then went away . 7.851303357410993
Jenkinson , who lives with them . 8.411829643407884
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to <UNK> him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <UNK> of your understanding , but <UNK> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <UNK> , and those which <UNK> the <UNK> ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the <UNK> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 22.791331041738957
You shall hear what she says . " She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . Hurst had a house . 19.312848429749163
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . 14.658337403166566
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time . 12.978443687208589
who could have done less for her ? 7.7708202184468735
Your sweetness and <UNK> are really <UNK> ; I do not know what to say to you . 15.377893277180416
" It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . 6.515158950040629
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . 10.444643224723674
Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 9.240142207052111
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! 11.021406223589764
Who should suffer but myself ? 15.404129917080667
" I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham . 8.109543789231743
I did not think Mrs . 4.348548719418636
It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed <UNK> ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among <UNK> woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its <UNK> parts . 23.6276304832636
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh . 16.170250393025498
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as , by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . 15.377041302687068
She answered him with cold civility . 10.201958224119535
Bennet was most <UNK> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 16.08197932508721
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . 11.447315630580091
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 12.659893254150004
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 22.545080823674148
" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . 12.32838684757513
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . 23.235902951082235
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . 17.813636993682277
After playing some <UNK> <UNK> , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to <UNK> such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " She smiled , but made no answer . 22.617991778770367
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! 13.547653889007847
I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister . 19.676778575933767
I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . " Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . 12.879010500037651
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . 15.335476285490351
Yet he is such a man ! " " Yes , yes , they must marry . 8.682459176104029
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . 16.0037563312799
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . 20.04499457886765
The pause was to Elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . 9.012951292672902
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , <UNK> from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and <UNK> by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 20.950202111573343
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? 11.517260830700682
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <UNK> by the possessor , and often without any attention to the <UNK> of the performance . 19.552939403540183
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 8.891368633097413
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> . 14.339297602379066
Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him . 9.56767943381207
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 13.579816004981216
" We can all plague and punish one another . 14.14894493325246
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . 10.357213295913585
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to <UNK> the fruits of her own <UNK> offence . 22.21244479574078
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 14.547108036831906

Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 16.65948932456026
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 18.62057643004203
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . 13.59802960907924
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? " Nothing less than the complaisance of a <UNK> could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most <UNK> courtesy . 24.644857999101443
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 9.649644004455942
but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley ' s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the <UNK> have no horses to theirs . " " I had much rather go in the coach . " " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure . 11.383332694981593
As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner ' s hope of Lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its <UNK> . 19.47291238378653
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . 10.604674404405822
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . 8.381880196778452
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! 13.46180692948883
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . " " I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which <UNK> in <UNK> a respectable man . 20.89258654812909
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . 17.530692540948998
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley is not he ? 9.899720493967223
<UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . " " We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . " " But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs . 12.27074848545289
She had no fear of its <UNK> farther , through his means . 14.6724115884155
<UNK> of business too ! 12.928793045088845
" So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find . 8.234503922912651
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left <UNK> , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . 15.977215724929769
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <UNK> shewn . 22.460042590585015
F . 3.8355300083888526
He has children of his own , and may have more . 6.383103453043041
I know no harm of her . " " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her <UNK> ' s death made her mistress of this fortune . " " No why should he ? 13.770098282986671
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted , is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK> their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and <UNK> them earnestly . But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . inf
At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! 17.677119072125148
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . 5.009757204644649
That lady I suppose is your mother . " Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . 10.280130215138497
I have not been accustomed to such language as this . 8.743704919315395
<UNK> , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . 12.08838471803068
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease . 13.58104642035765
The journey would moreover give her a <UNK> at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . 13.6862064958602
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . 10.457087753073411
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot . 6.753877704008986
I will answer for it he never cared three <UNK> about her . 14.365647121143136
He has more to give . 5.224467221442416
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <UNK> of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James ' s , with very decent composure . 24.77586465175411
Again she read on . 8.112338669063401
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . 18.336448754367837
" The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . 6.787309851494375
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 16.159586950434292
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . " " You may depend upon it , Madam , " said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , " that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . " Mrs . 12.079119440816362
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . 9.853325625454373
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . " Elizabeth was distressed . 8.144873445724812
' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! What , all five out at once ? 12.023293521549899
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be <UNK> to her nieces . 16.55771021174855
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " I have just received your letter , and shall <UNK> this whole morning to answering it , as I <UNK> that a little writing will not <UNK> what I have to tell you . 19.277808462169055
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . 11.772008692678916
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . 8.11146357526511
" If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs . 9.003915547972204
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . 10.157265376229388
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . " " Aye that is because you have the right disposition . 12.140160840930719
Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton . 9.20107774065247
I appeal to Mr . Darcy but let me not interrupt you , Sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the <UNK> converse of that young lady , whose <UNK> eyes are also <UNK> me . " The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 23.919576114173527
What congratulations will then flow in ! 16.230289887072043
The express was sent off directly . 13.20002715109977
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 11.966622623513429
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 13.204217920706219
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . 24.052325929383148
When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . 10.349873679170033
Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . 12.156687617137118
What shall we do with him ? 8.69742420467146
and to see dear Wickham too ! 6.7845859537614785
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been <UNK> by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 18.308005823272318
One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! 8.819586927175004
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . 18.016190355214828
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " " Ten thousand pounds ! 11.965611413720067
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 10.726517430141445
Adieu . 5.1212972437120055
Bennet , who assured him with some <UNK> that they were very well able to keep a good <UNK> , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <UNK> . 14.251639167910207
But so they always are . 5.689890417557618
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . 8.370584599278407
Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed . 13.093011992502575
" Where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door . 9.898883999291517
Bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone . 12.946939195981745
" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . 11.66135360760993
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . 17.86191801549855
here comes Hill . 11.370109430161595
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . 10.385536393026458
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , <UNK> every chance of <UNK> himself by marrying well ? 23.019120271835106
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . 9.899350904518405
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was . 14.427464138425151
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . 21.78017055144898
She is almost three and twenty ! 10.618628074995792
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the <UNK> of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . 18.129538007136233
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 17.85169631551951
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 15.969006953526003
Elizabeth did all she could , to <UNK> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 16.066458526661492
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . 5.099640205933804
" He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived . 7.358300173862692
<UNK> that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . 10.637395741738292
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <UNK> . 16.351795012554202
Elizabeth longed to <UNK> its <UNK> ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . 19.219585786702098
You are lucky in having such a master . " " Yes , Sir , I know I am . 8.023268964922151
The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood . 30.069713726994834
She will make him a very proper wife . " Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the <UNK> , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly <UNK> whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way . 20.141207076459597
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . 10.044424295278487
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . 14.580461509760806
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . 16.212080225043284
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before . 11.089985622644079
Jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all . 5.777762411991324
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . 14.785116213128127
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . " Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . 13.88864170176371
On Saturday he came again . 10.158257853163827
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a <UNK> kind of a little <UNK> on one side of your lawn . 18.05772331780051
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took <UNK> in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 14.797674630383671
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth ! 14.435737813494585
Yes , yes . 4.716445807290547
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others . 15.463116792133945
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . 8.602129184614482
In understanding Darcy was the superior . 7.937040811496487
The Foundation ' s <UNK> or federal tax <UNK> number is . 40.86159648983618
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 10.456673437343143
Its banks were neither formal , nor <UNK> adorned . 41.165506955705744
I must beg to return to the house . " And she rose as she spoke . 8.340064333848689
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 18.070867106543844
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . 13.763555927291208
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 18.374666427714246
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 13.17011814431333
Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to <UNK> . 12.336795148471623
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . 14.05102891468248
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 10.57598032949791
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . 11.01465106082669
" She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . 10.63215173070276
And his behaviour , so <UNK> altered , what could it mean ? 14.164293261966717
By Mrs . 4.875336401055788
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 22.039990451457854
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
She is unfortunately of a sickly <UNK> , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who <UNK> her education , and who still <UNK> with them . 22.674639865413745
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 25.12529098360766
no . I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . " " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may <UNK> our different opinions . " " No I cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . " " The present always <UNK> you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt . 15.384455463864082
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . 12.838134876171116
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 16.84672939485329
They are all for what they can get . 8.17060575374001
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . 9.97699745065181
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . 22.458566200622805
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the <UNK> of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . 13.859971041962307
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 12.800262021305878
<UNK> was the least of her feelings on this developement . 11.431580724324096

Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some <UNK> neighbour , who could not be enough <UNK> , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 22.556869729337375
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring . 4.869899504633811
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many <UNK> of that nature . 22.361343002705418
Adieu to disappointment and <UNK> . 13.26901783649889
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 15.240368751783144
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . " However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather <UNK> , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . 23.42333613677851
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . 14.660626221929084
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had <UNK> <UNK> only four months ago , would now have been <UNK> and gratefully received ! 22.679969989458645
<UNK> would like to go too of all things ! 14.77678132236101

CHAPTER IX . 7.654260973594331
The extravagance and general <UNK> which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 18.383063587116272
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 11.941338906762832
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> . 27.525451342979444
All field <UNK> were over . 22.653458463340705
" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance . 12.277868079422188
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 13.685130947936411
Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . 12.646508664532403

I only hope they may have half my good luck . 11.87100065217466
" No ; but it must be done soon . " Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . 15.994886712891695
Perhaps he thought her too young . 8.103388080740283
her liveliness had been never worse <UNK> . 16.273169031605953
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed . 16.37197862887196
" But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy . 16.62505969056361
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <UNK> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 18.59834983211836
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . 15.987971559688088
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . 20.8333930055506
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . 8.280410479851657
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . " " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . " To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <UNK> of an elegant female . 28.485875493359508
Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very <UNK> said , " What is the matter mamma ? 12.990892938234419
She saw with the <UNK> eye of fancy , the <UNK> of that gay bathing place covered with officers . 27.294677570251594
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 20.575694017119847
I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . 12.271152256933142

But no such recollection <UNK> her . 11.812663511050646
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " CHAPTER XVIII . 11.562406008607216
Pray read on . " " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she <UNK> so disgraceful a match . 18.151161982510683
But there are two things that I want very much to know one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . " " <UNK> ! 13.92892973742408
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . 12.074856420815099
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . 17.306095431214437
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 7.29557938638688
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . 8.516977398586892
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 11.418012737375387
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . 21.74390115385817
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her . 16.325994588294055
You refuse to <UNK> the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . 13.184196984610395
" To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . 8.248197890025766
A lively imagination soon settled it all . 15.350382201131787
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 11.8489783754331
It was a rational scheme to be sure ! 9.62558527821161
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 10.573184156249456
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . 7.657393374112867
There is a mixture of <UNK> and self importance in his letter , which promises well . 16.668958407519757
" Of music ! 9.280042471737575
" I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel <UNK> ' s regiment went away . 12.670247309240406
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so . 23.790233078111285
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . 13.608658899156465
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 10.95612885118123
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . 24.970116913526894

Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the <UNK> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . 20.208453280046175
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him . 12.051314183509168
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? 25.316540248818313
CHAPTER XIV . 7.654260973594331
" I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . " " Who do you mean , my dear ? 10.719311501570488
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 19.947686094164418
" Oh , yes ! if one could but go to Brighton ! 10.309914430529583
No , no I feel he may defy us there . 10.750769465791851
He was on one side of her mother . 5.818199560456941
Collins . 2.590745266357415
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted <UNK> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <UNK> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . 27.588773661042126
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the <UNK> . " This was not very consoling to Mrs . 14.472106071959717
And what do you think she said besides ? 10.706095062253032
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it . 18.38406549404992
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . 14.773823123184092
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy . 18.089447743668664
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . 20.671921974697355
You deserve no such attention . 9.379985454643158
But it must not , shall not be . 4.08684769304039
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . 20.18022125171255
How are they even to be discovered ? 10.674564084022673
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 16.450147998871678
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 18.958917428425988
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 11.126277287133588
Mr . Collins ' s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . 10.100466375330795
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . 7.88238388508854
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 12.911861045912932
I will leave him to himself . " In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . 11.024874519019564
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 11.465491300648326
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . 14.418180063439017
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head <UNK> acutely . 25.320588796877598
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 14.058417966600908
If he fears me , why come hither ? 17.13972420228901
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . 12.090802517152802
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . 10.657059313358609
I don ' t know . 9.081115045109739
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . 12.153980495007309
Mr . Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . 19.21805266082466
Elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several <UNK> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . 22.28691383961948
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 25.891726571107373
We dressed up <UNK> in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! 22.87213516124646
Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at <UNK> , and Mrs . 6.177793099142137
You do not look well . 6.443268057206088
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 10.833373183106072
Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 7.263092736692826
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . 12.58786476686444
She represented to him all the <UNK> of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . 14.165624183485075
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a <UNK> library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read <UNK> . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose <UNK> ' s <UNK> . 27.15307014280084
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it . 15.147425230145059
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 13.362981364805961
I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . " " I desire you will do no such thing . 14.418013563579093
It is a pity they are not handsome ! 10.394675655174629
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <UNK> , readily obeyed . 17.5930096854243
I will think no more about him . " Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth . 15.633002230416462
I will put on my things in a moment . 7.882582982447853
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . 14.075472762567374
But that is one great difference between us . 10.925950545995748
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . 14.931163051544704
my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . " " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . 12.838412698033903
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to <UNK> his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be <UNK> <UNK> . 15.69391569255089
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " As Mrs . 11.609408056408252
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 10.597285634466783
Bennet could hardly contain herself . 9.818088558135548
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 8.730031461705208
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ' s <UNK> , and complimented her on bearing it so well . 19.342925898989584
You must not suspect me . 7.542676358039567
She is well , and <UNK> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . Your ' s , c . 10.094040724025401
Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 13.96193733215506
When you told Mrs . 5.847689957774228
<UNK> at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . 17.17014514726609
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 11.445933648482182
They are my old friends . 9.442069952746966
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 25.811564502183955
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his <UNK> to myself . 14.08913497805756
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . 17.031729084782416
Have a little compassion on my nerves . 13.900781509501504
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . 15.934798833204752
" Yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally <UNK> , without raising all this <UNK> ! 18.50536555975922
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long . 22.97113472265577
' Ah ! 7.320766040639049
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? 15.760912074125635
Bingley was the principal <UNK> , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 10.650500024669919
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be <UNK> to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a <UNK> nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . 23.870725643385516
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! 18.09998702186473
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s t te t te with Mrs . 18.409301910720334
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 14.447951243928435
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . " Elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . 14.446307672131038
Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn . 11.718935575801968
The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . 13.648430393850322
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . " She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . 16.066018879938472
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house . 10.696626756251996
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . 9.639538405328238
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <UNK> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <UNK> . 22.74751691485322
But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . 11.631825749072457
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 12.455508234829574
<UNK> since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 14.21946531475187
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 21.640595262497513
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . 18.161778550158534
<UNK> are settled so <UNK> . " " You <UNK> perhaps to the entail of this estate . " " Ah ! 19.23189865880874
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 12.441357624145802
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 13.324050784504086
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . 12.69808276191347
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . " " I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your <UNK> what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . 15.716217016598492
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . 20.892435240111144
my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 9.408806557454218
and so did Mrs . 3.6092784947263556
I am ashamed of you ! 5.667521063547309
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the <UNK> curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two <UNK> of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . The envelope itself was likewise full . <UNK> her way along the lane , she then began it . 26.846306396929123
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 10.414029594550051
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . 15.25828277099369
CHAPTER XVI . 7.654260973594331
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Younge was of course removed from her charge . 11.875903849424285
The day passed much as the day before had done . 8.870062951100007
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . 14.998698996786194
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . 13.213929317309798
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 13.307282899384898
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 10.482292083325063
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> . 28.460024474601532
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . 20.704894644986616
But really , Ma ' am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . 16.8464612950062
I can hardly write for laughing . 9.924219695568766
But our visitor was very obstinate . 12.297401258047103
The second began . 6.984441390175042
But at length , by Elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that <UNK> which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the <UNK> . 16.78398946031516
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . 14.475943913631218
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . 16.846214466525378
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " Elizabeth could not but look surprised . 16.81017719114915
Well , much good may it do them ! 8.189470976846398
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the per <UNK> . 18.84891814187836
" Good Heaven ! 9.507086789514464
Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , <UNK> exclaimed , " Good Lord ! 22.395725462049402
Bennet , was not so well pleased with it . 5.02882899206503
CHAPTER IV . 7.654262124377574
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . 15.002502097092526
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . 11.74803484890884
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 21.437715953917905
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 19.222808433262703
Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day . 19.63168014247662
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been <UNK> , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . 15.191325267107876
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . 6.498466304302215
But it is of small importance . " " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and <UNK> me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? 14.688709149208497
It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ? 20.440253001268555
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general . 12.840730336251292
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas . 34.43501060953549
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . 14.151665368641142
I do think Mrs . 4.180628386377929
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ' s performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste . 24.757800581184846
Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " This walk is not wide enough for our party . 14.29574344757323
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? 15.925587502982475
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? " " Nearly three weeks . " " And you saw him frequently ? " " Yes , almost every day . " " His manners are very different from his cousin ' s . " " Yes , very different . 14.03326396940335
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good <UNK> will <UNK> it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth <UNK> lest her mother should be exposing herself again . 26.40081385561568
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! 14.25774799575727
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . 18.143314634174075
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ' s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . 18.116695124863696
He cannot afford it . 7.386426251999944
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . 18.002094573375476
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 16.99590116049474
She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . 38.20433145788476
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 15.41592434292649
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . 19.11723877736754
CHAPTER XI . 7.654260973594331
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 18.401757760827365
Philips were now <UNK> of the most interesting intelligence . 16.372439120175233
A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone . 10.935989077832467
It was not all settled before Monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . 10.34536745673753
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not <UNK> me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . 20.102131512551217
Most earnestly did she <UNK> to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . 22.090272955623306
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . 17.24899275240873
I had not believed it possible . " " I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth . 6.022268563980179
<UNK> those who are at all his <UNK> in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . 16.15270665098724
What do I not owe you ! 8.798031641941682
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 16.172138309988
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 13.33766176821144
Philips ' s <UNK> was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs . 15.318642290778973
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . 8.830018641667559
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 10.658868053679418
But there was still something <UNK> behind , of which prudence <UNK> the <UNK> . 26.328824052616625
Let us hope for better things . 11.961861626751995
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 14.120769489550959
<UNK> these efforts , Project Gutenberg tm electronic works , and the medium on which they may be <UNK> , may contain " <UNK> , " such as , but not limited to , <UNK> , <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> errors , a copyright or other intellectual property <UNK> , a defective or <UNK> <UNK> or other medium , a computer <UNK> , or computer <UNK> that <UNK> or cannot be read by your equipment . 49.1454679724838
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 15.67996284807269
So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 14.289706671247032
Collins knew not what to make of him . 5.447957829376821
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . 9.863521404092673
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 15.918304636740576
She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . 15.826746835624595
He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father ' s intentions . 18.043508046456555
Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . 14.907846457527352
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . 10.512707449598688
Those who do not complain are never pitied . " Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or <UNK> her would only increase the irritation . 26.91218222716215
They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . 12.553146241964912
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 21.652083503366217
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman <UNK> the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . 12.922646806439056
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 8.7870071007274
are sufficiently known . 8.292523754063307
Her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 19.033310715616725
" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . 8.743614342340607
This was very amiable , but Charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . 17.867661222757892
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . 19.29566510473027
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . " " But not before they went to Brighton ? " " No , I believe not . " " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? 11.300934104385329
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with <UNK> and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as <UNK> an air as possible . " Mr . Bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . 30.23943976182945
His sense of her inferiority of its being a <UNK> of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . 23.71331958096931
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <UNK> have alarmed her . 18.974003378215716
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the <UNK> on guard , and dressing a <UNK> and <UNK> . 36.00523372885042
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . 25.64407947778472
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 15.967203842201306
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . 9.847926286045706
" How <UNK> have I acted ! " she cried . " I , who have <UNK> myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! 17.47599089386145
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . 17.901191300732826
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 17.906815908530124
I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . 9.172103839150568
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . 9.275307041782291
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . 11.706138492451293
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <UNK> , distance becomes no evil . 27.651173704825606
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty <UNK> , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . 28.622677754320637
You will be a very happy woman . " Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 10.826796487635043
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were <UNK> the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . 18.553857190170508
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . 5.505052523263936
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . 18.296541666620737
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 11.130690384830764
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard . 19.994832282709858
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage . 19.862070049298
I shall see her in January . 6.859989194550565
<UNK> me whilst you can . " " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . " " Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . " " I cannot believe it . 11.780289021665638
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 4.686796382478596
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an <UNK> of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . 18.541824914810988
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . 16.657610971097817
" Oh ! 3.9535946941154325
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 12.992208538108617
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 19.44759222788567
Mr . Collins made his declaration in form . 8.712048052921658

Gardiner was so little to be trusted . " " You must not blame my aunt . 8.690094797045804
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . 20.611154378373378
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . " " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . 8.737186038109492
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . 16.100756097919778
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general <UNK> to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . 12.691940917690072
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 19.036932461889943
I cannot quite agree with you there . 7.847044290167652
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had <UNK> to his amusement . 17.723752661155963
Gardiner abused her stupidity . 12.251445478846518
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy ' s meditated elopement . 17.393214618995295
Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . 16.77781371589969
In spite of her deeply <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger . 19.239632892906933
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . " Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where Mrs . 14.024973845759332
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 11.612875232585901
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 11.288061544750265
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 17.67087083327483
Elizabeth , after slightly <UNK> it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . 15.94118753535197
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not <UNK> declare that Caroline neither <UNK> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <UNK> the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly ! to put me on my guard ? 22.298809110127827
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
There can be no love in all this . 7.166664010405536
Whatever bears affinity to <UNK> is <UNK> . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 24.1772620317256
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . 13.735796085013163
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane . 10.526906367206164
" I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . 6.4406852981853655

It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . " The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . 12.365128631125831
Thank Heaven ! 13.256940674358882
She could think only of her letter . 5.601427674701581
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 20.547811170165907
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 33.22400453476494
But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . 10.543325423185014
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? " " Oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all . 9.553827946754582
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . 6.960333435250664
Can I speak <UNK> ? 17.39647083939046
Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the <UNK> . 12.894620214014767
I hope you have destroyed the letter . 7.137525952634869
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 16.923016254232753
The morrow produced no <UNK> of Mrs . 15.19533593843648
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 18.9069119582135
I am sure you must feel it so . " " Oh ! 7.019182226715097
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 9.023816508952068
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried . 6.485214358668908
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . " <UNK> ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 15.11305829404144
Thank God ! 14.636854717027038
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and <UNK> forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . 15.207172869343768
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough . 15.491531724706677
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . 7.860959923870674
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 14.750622934311286
My courage always <UNK> with every attempt to <UNK> me . " " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . " Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . 17.131058550623557
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 16.187145852514973
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . 13.905980571934311
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . 13.568538242784518
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . 10.698062489812683
" I see what you are feeling , " replied Charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to marry you . 9.072078508326925
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 8.365061027609405
<UNK> , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . 16.960378146317804
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 21.337768042509072
" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . 7.908849088412298
CHAPTER VIII . 7.654260973594331
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . 19.630228884349663
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . 15.987177944901513
Three daughters married ! 15.241480676652099
Brighton , and a whole <UNK> of <UNK> , to us , who have been <UNK> already by one poor regiment of militia , and the <UNK> balls of Meryton . " " Now I have got some news for you , " said Lydia , as they sat down to table . 16.800140906272155
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 12.476606996951446
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . 12.524377879960735
Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . 15.281586604336923
He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 12.422475698387029
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . 15.88450123808891
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means <UNK> or <UNK> , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . 22.921590305153135
Bennet . 2.346798422130704
<UNK> requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much <UNK> and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements . 36.34844724069401
Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . " Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . 11.735155443106896
They <UNK> it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . 16.48712864536336
<UNK> check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and addresses . 78.14030071689011
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 18.962560874961344
He now wished it more than ever . 8.770586860584265
Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a <UNK> season , made her feel that the <UNK> , <UNK> , most thread bare <UNK> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <UNK> . 25.858042201965706
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . 16.222373269219496
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <UNK> them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 24.61942156382904
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . " They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . 12.021403756484132
It is too long ago . 8.311397791865472
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . 21.667009069036816
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 18.237586687902184
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 12.38055584080999
<UNK> pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . 11.102963268842236
" Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our <UNK> way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . " Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and <UNK> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 13.68635009388429
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 15.017023673503198
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . 14.369567857709402
CHAPTER XII . 7.654260973594331
I have by no means done . 5.95568328965934
I quite detest the man . " CHAPTER IV . 10.088654812801236
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . 14.891586462379832
<UNK> are too much like <UNK> . 22.322589461880536
How could I be so silly as to wish it ! 8.37858180372447
When this was done , she had a less active part to play . 10.272665318994523
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . 11.448884169093722
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to <UNK> the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 14.178058670933122
" I expected at least that the <UNK> were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! " " La ! 14.121566669664642
And then we were so merry all the way home ! 14.380370330490685
Why must their marriage be private ? 14.112120013741771
When they repaired to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 13.058468906249301
Mr . Darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . 8.043845186018348
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months . 10.553238960722787
You must learn some of my philosophy . 10.910311247787135
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 9.69089160083706
Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and <UNK> passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . 16.351999243918595
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 7.580304551539678
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
" Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane ' s . " CHAPTER XVIII . 10.874201251487065
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . 10.926902814671823
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> . 17.406314898827155
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . 13.916819634647675
Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? " " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . 22.593174024927876
It is Mr . Bingley I am sure . 5.189773777639336

I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected . 11.800896502152353
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . 7.818781158658769

I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . 19.48374148025681
I dare say he often <UNK> worse things said than I am going to say . 18.509264312449208
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs . 5.951230872068295
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . 35.804712354880486
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? 18.4498919067043
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . 14.840586980122453
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 13.263951981490177
<UNK> was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth " My dearest Lizzy , " I <UNK> myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . 24.777017819283436
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 14.87195661661433
She dared not even mention that gentleman . 11.500971797883484
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they <UNK> . 11.512579231905132
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . 11.742871811360821
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . 18.75861547912396
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . 21.352966384138206
Good bye . " She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she <UNK> about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . 18.18397458996565
Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her . 14.048647223868375
" You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . " " I should be sorry indeed , if it were . 9.570942108749886
He had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . 15.743578690354461
But these things happen so often ! 16.657552741529816
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 6.13419135675657
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her . 13.478652853963956
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . 4.047798952033564
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 14.070751884850711
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged . 16.882881112694367
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . 4.862904938546831
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 12.027758083991468
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . 14.555135230706433
It <UNK> me . 8.356749016614168
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . 11.908132946375453
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
Your <UNK> are by no means unlike . 20.100734088963023
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . 10.738815527021723
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 24.90424488055944
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . 16.77274772360856
<UNK> is subject to the trademark license , especially <UNK> <UNK> . 31.549619399779395
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 14.182250206476787
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . 24.098953181140704
" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 11.474687821523682
What am I to do ? " " Nothing child , nothing . 7.550837354621786
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 16.265891407197966
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library . " Mrs . 23.00784974661374
Every body declared that he was the <UNK> young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always <UNK> the appearance of his goodness . 17.043834581241434
But she would not be secure . 5.636787248329148
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . 8.36466811551751
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . 18.88691719139638
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . 22.186959161321962
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 15.069450239671134
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . 10.612602040361375
He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . " " Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . " He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . 15.60240429163096
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . 8.643792518972107
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . 18.500940764843985
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . 8.523329146441615
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . 8.61006712507972
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half expectation which Mrs . 15.852646537900531
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . 10.35144707675052
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . 16.835891217271822
I hope we may often meet again . " Elizabeth smiled . 10.040319479689558
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . 11.195833688381489
Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . 13.469311737909276
In such an <UNK> my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I <UNK> upon his goodness . " " Oh ! 18.18557315423734
Elizabeth immediately began playing again . 11.649222842549364
" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . " Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . 14.918980172605467
I was never more <UNK> ! 9.59991052051093
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 19.08626675788278
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <UNK> her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 17.54247995896424
" My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . " But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . 14.433839942190982

But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . 9.015446543994173
He is a pleasant fellow , and would <UNK> you <UNK> . " " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 15.072660537801122
But Georgiana would not join her . 7.79613281795863
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 12.524999258206076
I expected you to stay two months . 8.448023504950838
was not a man to be trusted . 4.930474975841627
" I never heard any thing so abominable . 8.500866282222766
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . 11.300928683302777
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . 14.31802604444898
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . 15.518570023334068
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! 13.522499971960118
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? 11.742977455654236
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she . 5.918597103910583
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 17.67660815107222
Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar . 14.684043019619644
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some <UNK> , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . " When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister . 19.253693747821384
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . 9.37402038848779
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle . 9.413798236409525
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 27.68405300003365
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason . 12.358535341428867
Nobody wants him to come . 10.280361198495756
You have delighted us long enough . 10.380081011595175
Its business office is located at North <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , . 62.69397094536998
By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <UNK> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 21.34133779619975
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 17.543494386323413
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 13.423275362120233
" And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 13.702152297303833
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? 13.543963349893744
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . 19.572937580253164
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . 11.566253199867804
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 16.06222490029167
" If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . 14.964068943440882
CHAPTER III . 7.414109323913755
And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from <UNK> . 11.295956440455914
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for <UNK> Lodge , the <UNK> are dreadful . " Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . 18.759935868010132
I wonder who first discovered the <UNK> of poetry in driving away love ! " " I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy . 18.82418883270174
Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . 13.958668303513837
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 22.78024243935061
" Yes if Darcy does not put it off again . 10.450667441085328
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 17.354501028995813
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild <UNK> of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . 20.72440954646576
<UNK> as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . 15.714248490208496
She was busily <UNK> through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . 23.348050391531718
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 16.928220554902303
You refuse , then , to oblige me . 7.030866910906274
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 10.980872592493439
Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general <UNK> , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . 16.480247237810598
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell <UNK> to mend a great <UNK> in my worked muslin gown , before they are <UNK> up . 28.140877090446892
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object . 11.292347834119504
<UNK> , stay , I will go myself . 8.635921820407322
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a <UNK> , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! 12.4199605753086
I had not an idea of it . " Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . 9.168868335528384
Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " Lord , how tired I am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn . 23.32260400386936
From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an <UNK> chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . 18.626402171582548
my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned . 7.839688959717334
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . 9.724338955091428
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . 13.618391603658544
" She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . " Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . 15.344151583399888
In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . 11.48405718325853
Your ' s , c . " Mr . Darcy ' s letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last . 8.93683122521502
She <UNK> the days that must <UNK> before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . 22.133991435289694
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth . 9.320626840861467
Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise . 7.023896036832131
Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him . 9.292613106863367
But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . 17.37131631680632
She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . 10.515788875543233
I remain , dear sir , with <UNK> compliments to your lady and daughters , your well <UNK> and friend , <UNK> <UNK> . " " At four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he <UNK> up the letter . 21.50348760793064
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . 13.75868392531087
Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . 18.000623355540636
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the <UNK> Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . 14.03831060474915
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . 15.74661944240897
They <UNK> every attempt of Mrs . 12.278648654414658
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <UNK> of a bad day . 16.201924760486783
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! 8.55343937155603
it must be my uncle ' s doings ! 10.497498922071788
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 23.90027395380251
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 14.450352020409174
Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ? 15.980410152446613
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 26.202165260245405
My feelings will not be repressed . 9.232756251498172
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole <UNK> of <UNK> , as was here collected in one individual . 30.332214150863344
What a fine thing for our girls ! " " How so ? 12.085488826986179
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Mr . Darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <UNK> throughout the whole . 22.21835058045988
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 12.843892628281157
In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . 12.124889757715932
Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . " " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . " " I believe , Ma ' am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . " " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . 10.710403419736819
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . 14.507525404785097
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . 13.270136702061015
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . 12.595563381190209
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some <UNK> in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . 17.096893596595617
But of course she did not mention my name to you . " " Yes , she did . " " And what did she say ? " " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well . 9.513213938682776
" Good Heaven ! 9.507086789514464
It is unaccountable ! 9.278411051770345
Bennet by admiring Mrs . 7.645673939245951
A few weeks , he believed . 8.951815701124994
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " Darcy mentioned his letter . 9.023541447421803
Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . 8.31491902219659
You must contrive to send somebody . 13.891202972626951
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . " " If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . 14.11466799630804
The <UNK> was <UNK> to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so <UNK> a <UNK> . 25.289234960016532
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . 11.033235361980429
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . 18.63017524930279
Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . " Mr . Bennet made no answer . 9.500470678099944
Miss Bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . 10.982474898031027
At length the chaise arrived , the <UNK> were <UNK> on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . 19.30081217307706
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable . 11.782917973034014
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? 16.126921670535335
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did . 12.059090387574585
" Yet why did he come ? " She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . 12.14427508398077
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . 13.943854542220802
What will become of me . 6.938745597498902
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . 20.46702318357219

" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt . 8.215779359522353
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . 14.077767041296386
And , besides , no <UNK> of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then supposing them to be in London . 11.438907257959173
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 20.276466336506022
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . 13.279980321593028
I am sick of them all . 5.669541907255582
Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 14.298712807305733
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare <UNK> to listen to . 31.081186815863134
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 14.843657544357322
" If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . 10.084547569153406
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 12.883449959650951
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . 7.546011835058594
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . 10.637814163841654
You are not going to be <UNK> , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . 13.972231471087136
She felt <UNK> the justice of Mr . Darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 14.103221547350467
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . 9.9548265737511
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 15.91616706971057
" I admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he . 10.692707517764779
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over . 32.373219482760106
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <UNK> . 18.984396367217734
But , alas ! 6.636143376469079
To no creature had it been revealed , where <UNK> was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 17.927856596813683
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 19.87291088159408
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this <UNK> . 20.959459868117175
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room . 12.582516945634184
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 17.149205538413884
They were hopeless of remedy . 10.771105225135397
" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . 11.925873364768966
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the <UNK> light , seemed most improbable . 20.949686298823355
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 17.169778608931306
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . 16.949454379692906
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . 15.074641294411395
That he has neither integrity nor honour . 18.029388327208142
But what is that to me ? 4.932471808140552
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 15.697460591378798
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you . 12.201616370906036
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . 16.12487665240443
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . " " Is that his design in settling here ? " " <UNK> ! 13.607924237393009
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . 11.97219929196151
In ran Mrs . 7.088111437399418
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas ' s last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the <UNK> were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three <UNK> <UNK> at least . 24.30398976857907
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , <UNK> over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in <UNK> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 14.957577119005894
But papa is so disagreeable . " " A little <UNK> bathing would set me up for ever . " " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty . 17.484281464638762
" How strange this is ! 8.426745805588514
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 23.930749250523597
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . 18.407153658502285
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I <UNK> believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . 19.135789852873213
She has two nieces of her own . 7.686461449833808
But enough of this . 4.134614529089242
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 12.628754235173671
" <UNK> it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . " " Gracechurch street , Monday , <UNK> . 12.266060074610538
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 13.620769532616073
Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . 15.280208755323294
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . " " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 10.461137738209882
Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <UNK> at whist , enumerating all the <UNK> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he <UNK> his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . 26.20880193583184
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . 19.966616294962073
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may <UNK> to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund . 31.08096871597556
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that . 14.02337964765349
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 18.033391178017144
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 10.983700608275
The <UNK> would be spoilt by <UNK> a fourth . 27.963708290351878
Oh , sister ! 4.525562332652025
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus <UNK> my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to <UNK> your authority in my behalf . 20.92870889779301
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . " " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . 9.956629290825974
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! 16.081645458159535
If gratitude and esteem are good <UNK> of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 26.35472956444744
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . 11.678969718936585
She <UNK> Miss <UNK> a treasure . 24.325355283128907
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it . 9.333773018083749
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . " " This is not to be borne . 10.159567577421882
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 10.968111165025466
She will be taken good care of . 7.785601967037981

Mr . Darcy was <UNK> him with <UNK> wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . 15.061175567356992
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 10.452075387208888
What is to become of us ! 8.110902806935936
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . 10.643632428790424
They contained no actual <UNK> , nor was there any <UNK> of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 33.5527015961298
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 18.117064135308524
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and <UNK> them up , though as she never came without <UNK> some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or <UNK> , she seldom went away without leaving them more <UNK> than she found them . 28.398930104475983
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . " " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 10.562912352499115
With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . 16.659843675491146
When the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a <UNK> to her mother ' s <UNK> for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . 20.521596030509027
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . 8.448938456301358

I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr . Darcy . " She then sought her eldest sister , who had <UNK> to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . 15.171001519735935
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 12.964069676719165
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . 15.631048250920907
This son was to join in <UNK> off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . 15.484642961967433
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the <UNK> , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 20.455363384224718
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . " " If I were as rich as Mr . Darcy , " cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , " I should not care how proud I was . 13.07168651479542
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 14.130015351584948
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 16.658461221078067
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge . 16.41948198394021

Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " " You have . 10.655466685538835

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr .

When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs . 11.25034469636162

You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 9.198809631672882
The t te t te surprised them . 24.689165948553754
Caroline is incapable of wilfully <UNK> any one ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . " " That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine . 16.263786881299605
But if I go on , I shall <UNK> you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . 13.273149830287634
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . 15.136196305285917
I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . " " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <UNK> of you . 14.77490025557767
<UNK> of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where . 22.540674001554713
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . " " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . " " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . " " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . " " But consider your daughters . 12.836319782623018
" Oh ! 3.9535946941154325
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 7.273670549018851
" There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London . 17.653993034968977
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to <UNK> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . 26.15919989922584
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . " " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be <UNK> beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen . 15.025251164656767
CHAPTER VIII . 7.654260973594331
Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 13.986224786221245
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 9.702690556859247
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 11.847591616553842

She will not be able to help calling . " " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 15.746187181664055
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? 16.708179439639622

I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 9.610302647239148
I shall like it of all things . 6.042303481917148
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . 13.66676912547301
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . <UNK> staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . 20.57930047390497
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 12.683587158265548
I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . 8.506001305276007
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . 13.589864884171595
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . 19.063676723557148
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 15.102501397029496
This is my advice . 6.7501352577305465
Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 7.583820030827521
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of <UNK> the mind of his wife . 27.952091958636252
This letter is from Mr . Collins . " " From Mr . Collins ! 7.052972701602858
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 14.005778359565037
Heaven and <UNK> ! of what are you thinking ? 14.55771772727464
It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . " " Oh ! 10.053184919231022
These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 15.1256496833237
Bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . 12.877923915153124
how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would <UNK> you about to all the balls . 10.273036727972967
The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 16.94439201562367
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . 15.05276513614589
The others have been gone on to <UNK> , these three weeks . " She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . 13.867803460939248
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . " " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <UNK> which other people may observe . 22.806890641882376
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . 12.791288235779161
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
" I hope , " added Mrs . 3.7841311397140367
I cannot understand it . 4.979943647399148
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . 11.880790078340603
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long . 14.896864563690329
what felicity ! 6.759957587059268
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . 11.12295885772571
Yes , I call it a very easy distance . " " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth . 9.50642621907768
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 15.701699424271698
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said . 14.924863471169964
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . 10.555325437306527
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . 15.280930422813888
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 9.654042395883902
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <UNK> , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 13.87315515042767
Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . 22.016737536626962
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . " CHAPTER IV . 14.807409904859508
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . 10.615308121437902
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of <UNK> from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a <UNK> horse . 32.587918279936424
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . 15.728641946203794
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night . 14.891924270120246
<UNK> the Foundation as set forth in Section below . 25.153264713077274
Allowing for the common <UNK> of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy . 11.97372919708916
The first part of Mrs . 5.747767666868488
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 9.104230953659034
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 22.778997226771363
<UNK> , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . 19.62705269691938
She had been <UNK> pleased to approve of both the <UNK> , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . 15.84893647611741
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . 10.574371212459054
<UNK> as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> . 22.821072099081942
We passed each other several times . 17.00170729276911
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 16.4544498256373
She shared in their attendance on Mrs . 11.166630341391272
. 1.5031584747735605
I shall be back by dinner . " " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . 15.013708357975853
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs . 12.228080656398484
I am sure you will be very comfortable there . 7.972480732894724
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 23.579698305486637
Mr . Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . 10.646026423427418
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth <UNK> out the coffee , in so close a <UNK> , that there was not a single <UNK> near her , which would admit of a chair . 19.456424924517908
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature . 23.31764455123765
Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 6.218850964281067
Lydia , my love , ring the bell . 7.808540018511829
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with <UNK> all the <UNK> explanations . 21.748678868947223
Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <UNK> and <UNK> father ; and though he belonged to one of the <UNK> , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 22.279104781082548
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever . 9.7517503495783
I am the happiest creature in the world . 7.370676958070156
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our <UNK> ! 16.468234992134047
" They are going to be <UNK> near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! 17.84467694089738
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much <UNK> ; but when Mrs . 20.06957281911823
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . 11.101601887281712
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . 13.192471161150948
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being <UNK> by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . 21.380809321868327
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . 13.463385170561004
where is your <UNK> my dear ? " But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 12.975312272896828
Good gracious ! 12.069672583760374
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 26.777631745957738
The <UNK> <UNK> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have . 18.46700865634293
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . 7.837986065188344
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
Good bye . 8.654192614224218
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " Their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . 21.465187384272237
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . 6.19481629220107
Who are your uncles and <UNK> ? 22.096428670325324
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . 26.303427575072718
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
I always had a value for him . 5.800076547229774
The path just admitted three . 17.11385363131768
She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . 19.202535706661997
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there . 25.41668056889859
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 11.506977827123892
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . 13.582309426155874
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . 11.59916291471353
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation . 17.681589713676473
" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her . 8.632928228443067
It <UNK> me , I confess ; for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . 14.584603263395547
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 15.069156112985427
What a contrast between him and his friend ! 11.304804723952538
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . 6.017041211640987
But we must <UNK> the tide of malice , and <UNK> into the wounded <UNK> of each other , the <UNK> of sisterly consolation . " Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " <UNK> as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is <UNK> that one false step <UNK> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <UNK> than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 29.07416609481829
Bennet . " My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received <UNK> at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right <UNK> Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose <UNK> and <UNK> has preferred me to the valuable <UNK> of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <UNK> myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those <UNK> and <UNK> which are <UNK> by the <UNK> of England . 37.27516762070705
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . " " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . 12.393698163712882
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling . 19.856727219891297
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 10.300653484380225
The Foundation ' s principal office is located at <UNK> Dr . S . 34.250089571797
" Do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; " that is rather singular . " " Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " <UNK> cards . 13.244514177965987
How are you all ? " " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 14.939971422195901
why did she come ? 8.66669246126907
Reynolds could interest her on no other point . 11.202107461543216
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . 10.069877713979865
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my <UNK> and care . 16.810447031735702
The next was in these words . 7.8685089877153915
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage . 16.958370809532063
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . 15.53279649271578
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ? 13.358456140053612
" You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . 10.799653909924091
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . 13.381814397026902
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . 15.703403241509621
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . " " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . 12.717069891481565
Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go . 8.78521632649362
Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently . 9.43047553099251
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> . 11.270184941462492
She then took a large house in <UNK> street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . 29.141123762620683
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <UNK> of elegant nuptials , fine <UNK> , new carriages , and servants . 18.017800868363675
I am sure my sisters must all envy me . 10.768633317309702
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 12.990337924440398
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 13.005694991445331
But I suppose you had no opportunity . 6.848726458336201
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . " Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . 23.104981415695732
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 9.714816280663628
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . 10.03650488999001
I thought it my duty to give the <UNK> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well <UNK> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . 21.24299128261123
What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a <UNK> of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . " " Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . " " And what arts did he use to separate them ? " " He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling . 19.3551929673824
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 14.428843695324774
" It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . 9.498837089849365
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . " Mr . Bingley followed his advice . 13.833532067590227
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . " " Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . 12.721332342752296
In <UNK> lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <UNK> in this interference . 19.973523190649676
Collins well . " " Yes , very well . 4.655168699283599
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . 12.83970855845407
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 6.079417440744661
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . 19.2881575513659
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
But do not imagine that he is always here so often . 9.775730266419465
There is nothing else to be done . 7.538440159024586
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 13.890507473414745
It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . 13.705825696738724
The old lady is Mrs . 8.322163911017554
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 16.38685135108352
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 10.879121046445068
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . 16.728155423895796
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . 18.06324893494742
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <UNK> satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 25.05660452895781
In Three Volumes . 14.990310088043724
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . 12.934445741487313
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . 5.451377817855356
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them . 8.468579522190975
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . 17.68914200077568
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . " " To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . " " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . " " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . 15.85281801416043
<UNK> such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not <UNK> the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . 14.163359626135332
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . 21.186023634389215
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . 14.062729717868773
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . 12.110100274290676
Lady Catherine ' s great attentions to Mrs . 8.3526896235443
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 18.743629503851487
Lydia ' s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , <UNK> engaged with one of the <UNK> <UNK> in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little <UNK> , of his house and garden at Hunsford . 15.213664507914318
That is all settled . " " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . 10.13652969359518
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 11.95647234277088
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . 12.352554174169752
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 8.904086591258851
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 13.158804242829214
Your mother <UNK> upon your accepting it . 20.236105691054725
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 17.046960968328637
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative . 10.941158847580004
" Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 14.351835923839989
Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ' s <UNK> enough to <UNK> him from its <UNK> , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never <UNK> without him . " " So much the better . 18.359405968020617
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . 14.975424624734254
and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! 14.526751357064612
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 17.865982656273072
yes . 3.7650833196037317
Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . 15.696558931067994
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be <UNK> at , and it was rather too early to begin . 12.762195256156813
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another . 16.401963991554148
" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet ' s manor . 11.010886192758157
" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . 9.50435755255891
" I am sure there is not on his . 4.893351825962999
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . 18.227246381718256
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " " You may as well call it impertinence at once . 14.789449417945994
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . 11.961075619915087
The Miss <UNK> all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . Do you draw ? " " No , not at all . " " What , none of you ? " " Not one . " " That is very strange . 11.278723992033175
And when you have given your ball , " she added , " I shall insist on their giving one also . 11.552258974306758
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 9.259318094870324
The supposition did not pain her . 8.911989530055852
She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 16.140372949667178
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . " " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . 13.626587828278998
You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs . 10.807298289448932
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 15.702032344429314
In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <UNK> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 15.796970170139705
Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night <UNK> and <UNK> gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty <UNK> away . " " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " " You go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds ! 19.45712882753147
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s <UNK> her coming so far alone . 20.44010095531254
Such a disappointment ! 9.374243202321786
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . 16.346285476213552
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does . 9.679302131347729
I speak nothing but the truth . 6.195129775789194
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 16.057252932146305
Is this to be endured ! 9.654032200575795
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 13.095578515054306
Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . 13.834158421191184
Pemberley was now Georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . 11.32565419569173
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . 19.89059923928121
Mr . Collins was carefully <UNK> them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <UNK> them . 16.821695294403714
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <UNK> <UNK> better than <UNK> ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 22.034457114706253
" With my mother up stairs . 8.964182923874677
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them . 9.461953934366113
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go . 6.217927662362512
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not <UNK> their own , so much the better . 12.208699618402605
" Your affectionate friend , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " Oh ! 13.458230076415957
He heard her with astonishment . 6.271171413046918
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <UNK> . 16.647957815854063
But Mrs . 3.2041352622669828
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . " " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . 14.66125504464021
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 19.394535741530348
That he was surprised by the <UNK> was evident ; he <UNK> it however with <UNK> , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner . 17.217216178439312
And one of my own daughters . 6.588820111169405

Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . " This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . 16.286409756333455
I never saw such <UNK> , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " Mrs . 9.539580933877094
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . 12.254862780953482
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . " " Oh ! 11.301598024292433
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 19.782634039222614
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 10.032955374927806
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 18.30700731011055
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all <UNK> , if she <UNK> more , and could have the advantage of a London master . 12.495858417448835
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . 16.656493394191724
What a good joke it will be ! 10.142968698631975
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good <UNK> engaged Mr . Collins ' s conversation to herself . 16.0352534176793
Her hair so <UNK> , so <UNK> ! " " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six <UNK> deep in <UNK> , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . " " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . 21.10412948577712
When I last saw her , she was not very promising . 7.126214291388667
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . 12.063765166781218
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <UNK> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . 18.870615673080334
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of <UNK> for them . 17.24479360783839
She <UNK> from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . 17.796077224783016
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new <UNK> . 17.50755906648191
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . 17.202909056849798
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . 19.183491454406912
Their visits to Mrs . 7.378663808838249
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 9.154764533541613
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . 17.87324768431299
But with me , it is not so . 3.792879374205363
And do you really love him quite well enough ? 13.489497029052732
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in <UNK> , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . 20.218744789080432
Bennet thus began the <UNK> conversation . " Oh ! 14.20100483205525
I think she will be pleased with the <UNK> . " Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs . 17.592266145234138
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . 15.549467226329597
" Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . " She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . 17.648409794262722
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . " " I am , " said he , with a firm voice . 8.341683569443257
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon <UNK> up every private care ; and covering her face with her <UNK> , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . 17.159895356494243
" I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five <UNK> any object . 15.171128612411602
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . 8.716467999861067
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 10.082910388539808
that abominable Mr . Darcy ! My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to <UNK> it . 13.799991317401153
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . 23.31726029985141
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 9.718074266243033
" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . 16.30508150629271
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a <UNK> fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered <UNK> to the repeated <UNK> of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 18.98877371006205
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 12.670348502784945
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . 5.38206887992418
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . 20.278099957024086
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . 8.931661671440214
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him . 9.437985993012221
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 13.073565786530368
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane . 14.22631664605416
The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 15.13723499797844
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and <UNK> , and talk and laugh all the way home . 15.323894095260613
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 17.045962397667697
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral <UNK> from the evil before them . 17.078136549992042
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a <UNK> . 13.474411589617803
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . 18.02211530182676
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " Oh ! 16.04884332504894
how I wanted you ! " " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . " " Certainly . 15.405868283434524
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe . 10.61614943788073
Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes . 17.088074217877153
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 21.144149521932658
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . 19.24113838239667
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her <UNK> being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 16.530676103189936
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 17.43688759383799
Every thing , however , went on <UNK> , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ' s first sketch . 17.833418629913243
The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . 16.23197233431557
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 19.619040064943356
CHAPTER XV . 7.654260973594331
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . 18.750743605003326
mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to day ? 16.309313325162464
Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . 17.92284230372092
<UNK> had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and <UNK> her disgust of Mr . Collins . 15.874122652840748
Her ladyship ' s carriage is <UNK> ordered for us . 20.156093779895226
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . 4.432567684963236
A small sum could not do all this . " " No , " said her father , " Wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a <UNK> less than ten thousand pounds . 14.730693346715755
His belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 13.721235690772062
He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? 11.13961698587455
The loo table , however , did not appear . 9.747139153359763
And is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? 9.676597466871447
Will you come and see me ? " " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . " " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . 10.932075333103032
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> ! 17.194835327822194
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . 8.6645729782712
can it be really so ! 6.303695473616213
Till this moment , I never knew myself . " From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . 13.141489389645708
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent . 10.318129880968844
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be <UNK> from it . 13.925632885506294
what could she mean by it ? 6.846884197394046
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . 17.721937295587953
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr . Bingley ? " " When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . 9.238845615559864
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as <UNK> , were in very good time . 17.109458977304254
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My <UNK> were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte . 15.23578316624093
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . 11.984253805332608
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . 14.239763243753126
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 14.776652248844393
" Good gracious ! 9.633123540177058
One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 17.515644640564094
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 19.21017578409462
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . " " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " " Has your governess left you ? " " We never had any governess . " " No governess ! 18.579973421481384
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . 9.450553752455908
what does he say ? 7.116061345629992
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so <UNK> that I cannot answer for being <UNK> . 18.463875217263038
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 8.736967691456263
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 18.332117962226295
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 6.986308607765659
But I know the foundation is unjust . 9.3753633669915
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . 26.309513806334408
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 17.614624495571498
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 11.738840712599178
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 17.867429497888658
" Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 13.450634713200515
His character was to speak for itself . 8.855707286143934
Oh , no . " " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . " " No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . " " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . " She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . 12.852272424815009
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . 19.69257704680446
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford <UNK> , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 21.8624340697149
It was all pride and <UNK> . 8.641925409438437
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother ' s schemes . 15.188476108995621
And a special licence . 12.448131833663764
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . 14.377752050793534
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield . 16.902647446807983
But it was a hope shortly checked by other <UNK> , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . 20.69214079525078
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . 14.865197226783899
How I long to see her ! 6.302351038816012
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . 10.137918454640745
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . 14.787257772286468
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . 8.790510732869343
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . 16.41215799191203
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 10.906995413626623
You are a gentleman ' s daughter . 7.2570096034823965
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 10.618335392194044
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and <UNK> the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 20.961612493793865
" They will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . 12.164862211907336
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 14.070912867959416
" You may well warn me against such an evil . 14.660539629538519
After a short silence , the lady first spoke . 10.40640870343431
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity . 24.74581052356634
Mr . Darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . 6.206534676367182
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . 21.09516732671275
Her <UNK> are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . 14.897473856883922
But you are always giving her the preference . " " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . " " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? 14.41438043155609
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <UNK> of Mrs . 10.775824689214037
Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley . 9.510923502734238
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 14.717087397476686
You see on what a footing we are . 10.14548989946625
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . 10.01005584241479
I would keep a pack of <UNK> , and drink a bottle of wine every day . " " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . 16.90940507053974
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one <UNK> of perfect <UNK> in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his <UNK> that her manners were not those of the <UNK> world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . 25.28200997388602
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 12.62484798381227
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . 11.751375038702852
If , indeed , it should be so ! 5.39494259952595
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . 14.28704547119881
The <UNK> of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . 18.177969372410637
and his sisters are charming women . 8.688037712329368
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . 16.967162226611777
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long <UNK> . " Mrs . 12.598323122087384
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him . 15.09602354015065
She will be down in a moment I dare say . " He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 10.858981405423645
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . 20.764166965637564
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more <UNK> , and less <UNK> than the other had ever seen him . 18.446743509961152
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . 7.458140352707231
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 8.831803502165814
Let her go then . 6.4583798430581085
His brother in law , Mr . Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr . Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble <UNK> ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . 19.855822251370235
After <UNK> their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ? 51.07912571617235
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 22.565421902698116
" If they had uncles enough to <UNK> all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one <UNK> less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . 17.695696732183254
But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . 9.687512616313008
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 18.78225487579419
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ' s regiment . " His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative . 18.554727339891084
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg tm License when you share it without charge with others . 32.6115424648283
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . " As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the <UNK> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . 14.890539292328747
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . 13.207116036989323
Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 9.373451852856652
Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . 11.545651634646072
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please . 11.101126425663505
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . 18.430715756022035
<UNK> to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax <UNK> to the full extent permitted by U . S . federal laws and your state ' s laws . 45.788306661102744
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 11.535388095962311
nonsense , how can you talk so ! 10.259412486143843
A person may be proud without being vain . 16.019678100966033
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set <UNK> . 9.082652707539653
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
" You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice . 11.155247763552827
Kitty , run down and order the carriage . 10.222436315280452
This will never do . " " You need not distress yourself . 10.079849767895391
I enquired after their brother , of course . 7.63919014084746
" I cannot see why Mrs . 6.344167715714209
Bennet ' s <UNK> looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . 26.258636634438435
My watchfulness has been <UNK> ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I <UNK> in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance . 19.616637916114858
Have you had any flirting ? 12.623967111650693
Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . 12.334451303248677
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 13.619641278200772
There ' s for you ! 5.768678580261803
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to <UNK> her confidence in it . 14.49150236423518
She declared her resolution . 7.6061179647507275
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . 9.265458059905145
Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . 10.86091252208608
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley . 15.047784596959886
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of <UNK> on Mr . Collins ' s side , and as many bows on Sir William ' s , they departed . 19.1920909659997
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the <UNK> of his confidence in his friend . 17.095026749459876
Her affections had been continually <UNK> , but never without an object . 20.049168001169512
Poor dear child ! 14.154549910994632
" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . 7.813102218005841
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane " I hope and trust they will yet be happy . 14.35605272036071
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . 20.098306826853047
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 10.694273828364933
" Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy . 6.149436494054408
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 14.570153520935811
How was that possible ? 6.610799408245915
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 14.982572232168916
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 15.589953846841725
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . 13.596954870942236
I did for you . 3.1124636811276645
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 11.804389449812751
I saw them the night before last . " Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . 12.815904309400448
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . 7.453678841187489
Kitty and Lydia were far from <UNK> Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . 15.804650390512665
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " This was invitation enough . 8.536527730842485
You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her <UNK> , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . 14.82404269224086
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well . 12.464651014627739
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 20.016884056442986
shocking ! " cried Miss Bingley . 8.083188479476078
It will save me a world of trouble and economy . 13.06541121656291
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . 17.384935403259487
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most <UNK> in inviting Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 17.320325019098203
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was <UNK> her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs . 13.044319345730395
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . 12.720741801160424
yes , " said Elizabeth drily " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a <UNK> deal of care of him . " " <UNK> of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care . 16.62220120296991
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild <UNK> , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character . 21.61069658684985
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? " " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . " " Oh ! 11.3558444841993
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 17.41239734391937
Bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . 14.389292624040152
" Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal <UNK> , you last night laid to my charge . 18.419283172001226
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 8.389291244134917
My dear Mr . Bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? 7.166506114372815
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy . 11.48402299665589
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 13.546672621252831
Well , how pleased I am ! 7.922895678741386
They were within twenty <UNK> of each other , and so <UNK> was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . 16.38638155447327
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother How is she ? 11.08740334882174
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy . 13.060728541169082
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself <UNK> watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . 12.306251900266224
My father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . 16.12432339392263
I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a <UNK> up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 10.875071071401544
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be <UNK> . 10.628168715389632
Such very superior dancing is not often seen . 14.800029356482195
<UNK> more than half a day ' s journey . 14.389227237059343
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . 16.771721314045855
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the <UNK> road . 17.61150352018603
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 9.38856607810252
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 8.951981720193055
Never mind Miss Lizzy ' s hair . " " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . " " Oh ! 17.096439281387596
It was very little less . 5.768845461453274
If the <UNK> of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . 18.42580440021249
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . 13.04392629305486
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 13.220657529999178
They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins ' s admiration . 8.152649878982732

Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ? 17.09878975359421
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to <UNK> , and was but slightly affected by his <UNK> of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the <UNK> altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh . 24.521799197894694
I have no such <UNK> to resent . 10.06129472458542
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 18.31741649019027
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . " " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth . 13.714039969693498
She often tried to provoke Darcy into <UNK> her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . 22.950070245712983
GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 21.97307448071134
CHAPTER XV . 7.654260973594331
On this subject , what can you have to say ? 8.143211567832491
Collins , did I tell you of Lady <UNK> ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? 16.601563314799538
Elizabeth <UNK> the next morning to the same thoughts and <UNK> which had at length closed her eyes . 19.7981336628402
" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . 13.958180262747327
But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he <UNK> that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 13.577647589715877
Could he , or the Lucases , have <UNK> on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the <UNK> more effectually to what they related ? 20.935368360787752
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 13.851532956966922
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? 11.65283863241384
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw . 6.716164186402813
Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . 9.568098901317041
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . 17.091312293772933
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise . 34.37234693540154
You need not . 5.0290119446193655
The <UNK> pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . 16.17046110068526
" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . 10.126350625725834
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr . Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and <UNK> the prospects of Mr . Wickham . <UNK> and <UNK> to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a <UNK> , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the <UNK> of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the <UNK> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd . I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ' s accidental information , that Bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . inf
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <UNK> <UNK> . 21.0081377384276
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <UNK> at the <UNK> of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time <UNK> her natural degree of sense , since the <UNK> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be <UNK> , was likely to be <UNK> in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a <UNK> place and a camp . 31.62230624597216
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States . 19.8694276972806
He leaves out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <UNK> . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must <UNK> reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility . 17.862215086795924
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 18.131887982053854
<UNK> to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . 15.03324288957048
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 18.994019480103162
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of <UNK> , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than <UNK> anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 25.36988855581705
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . 11.798618934488882
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . 21.148595334106695
<UNK> back the servant , therefore , she <UNK> him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost <UNK> , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly . 23.33296769155259
Her performance on the piano forte is <UNK> . " " It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . " " All young ladies accomplished ! 15.984943974912643
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . 10.95110556202952
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . 14.064278445640266
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 11.485452916415314
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . 9.24177389960848
Forster and me are such friends ! and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? 15.161515981732455
As for your Elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what <UNK> could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye <UNK> , so remarkably fine , might be copied . " At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . 17.423187332634374
" And may I ask ? " said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . " " <UNK> with ! 8.44656496342799
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 5.289375148473826
" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . " Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . 17.014323471883092

If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . 9.451223315078973
. E . . You may convert to and distribute this work in any <UNK> , <UNK> , marked up , <UNK> or <UNK> form , including any word <UNK> or <UNK> form . 36.38877351482609
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 19.264564252828134
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . 14.478411059117601
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? 19.84397013862064
On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and told her with great <UNK> that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . 18.37350164243161
He could number the <UNK> in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <UNK> . 23.172081676719934
There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . 7.657064339576378
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . " " Very true ; and if I had my will , we should . 9.19502992095289
Their fortune on both sides is splendid . 19.914519104705562
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . 11.567385280358822
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled . 17.349289500313592
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . 13.35439902923729
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 13.255341592192357
The business was therefore soon settled . 9.347108636305562
Bennet was <UNK> the fire . 9.596372780510485
Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . 17.666068765648024
How he lived I know not . 6.668353133235515
Gardiner . 2.8792509164189544
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however <UNK> its existence might prove , had at least <UNK> one day . 21.819188982865263
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 20.172712664295513
<UNK> wore a happier aspect . 30.997392796076017
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months . 24.07498438491953
<UNK> , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . 12.370710401914069
dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . 8.638590257372732
Bennet ' s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . 10.981730002506067
<UNK> Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . " " If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . " " She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . 15.517637062407436
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 18.3342586447762
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 12.618103227609353
Sir William did not say much . 8.467263542212747
With the <UNK> concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 17.52710443632416
There is a <UNK> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . 13.483829518763566
Has it not been <UNK> <UNK> by yourselves ? 33.35744478712889
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . 10.787757754530015
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 17.108650947150267
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " Well , Jane , who is it from ? 11.75014552681573
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . " Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . 12.569174741169887
I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the <UNK> . 8.22954395794976
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . 12.293927981998511
And she was only sixteen last June . 12.905764417196542
When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . 14.434545197681913
<UNK> may sometimes be purchased too dearly . 28.911246117098834
. 1.5031584747735605
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 13.972971484920969
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . 14.070694278344673
It was agreed to . 4.4605037094884885
At present we have nothing to guide us . 13.113551725954524
I will read it to you " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles <UNK> to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <UNK> <UNK> . 18.965220762922502
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character . 15.089943083198175
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 8.575621955046948
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . 14.182988693351287
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . 8.735202974579625
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including <UNK> , online payments and credit card donations . 46.59591835632807
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 12.185872865136227
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . 11.608403376351623
She has known him only a fortnight . 8.779838821132302
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done . 14.064624220827024
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 24.482842251110252
Bennet <UNK> the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . 10.688392119758554
" Oh , Lizzy ! 4.521243033274726
I shall now know how to act . 7.898243016527198
<UNK> my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . 16.36267880279109
Ten thousand a year ! 14.626769482865448
Every kind of pride must <UNK> from the connection . 16.49321781884585
Mary <UNK> for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . 22.611196933363704
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? 13.484674760350329
Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , <UNK> him I believe very early in life . 18.023051532614904
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 18.01646512649294
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . 23.15053028218151
He begged pardon for having displeased her . 15.660708404733844
" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . " " I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice . 11.053202142524063
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 18.464611044987322
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 13.062838212027875
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 21.971725839262923
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Dear me ! 7.8649594553648745
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly <UNK> at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 12.819183306963549
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly <UNK> , she seated herself . 20.76603520302615
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 14.369781914957166
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs . 10.042708432652937
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . 14.014336899546215
" <UNK> resentment is a shade in a character . 13.106066787720998
She had very little notice from any but him . 7.917165626901954
Philips first brought her the news . " Well , so much the better . 8.053734526932788
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 14.1342656694353
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 15.017891190314836
But self , though it would intrude , could not <UNK> her . 10.549050427925884
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <UNK> <UNK> necessary . 27.171557701767235
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B . 17.512645917572108
Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt . 9.888455878358966
CHAPTER V . 7.65426164366213
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional <UNK> in praise of his own humble abode , and the <UNK> it was receiving , he was happily employed <UNK> the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . 21.32458220870526
" Yours , c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . 12.755297324832686
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and <UNK> . 22.041587562557183
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . 14.495891310133192
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity . 23.349346998736447
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . " " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an <UNK> , <UNK> disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will <UNK> the whole room , and be handed down to <UNK> with all the <UNK> of a <UNK> . " " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he . 20.516087088193785
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so <UNK> ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . 16.53449026041717
Mr . Darcy is engaged to my daughter . 5.375208423233086
Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . 13.490800500181326
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself . 18.254992694396606
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . 17.79009330574888
The time fixed for the beginning of their <UNK> tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . 19.30677629032087
" I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . " " Not at all , " he replied ; " they were <UNK> by the exercise . " A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . 12.841305112652927
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . 17.301623975177325
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . 11.199262129292837
To <UNK> <UNK> or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www . gutenberg . org donate While we cannot and do not solicit <UNK> from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no <UNK> against accepting <UNK> donations from <UNK> in such states who approach us with offers to donate . 67.70095352751264
Annesley is with her . 5.12087567155511
On both sides it was only assertion . 15.656361714443854
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no <UNK> the frequent mention of Wickham ' s name . 12.732558360244326
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " " Are you , indeed ? 8.079807232902118
If your feelings are still what they were last <UNK> , tell me so at once . 16.303700027094028
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . 9.318815309618863
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings . 16.392232132441844
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! 16.66195812811873
Collins and myself sincerely <UNK> with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the <UNK> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 18.468242096737626
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs . 17.472899607198503
" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . " " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . " Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . 16.4235150539511
It seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary <UNK> , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . 25.495490450926507
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great <UNK> . 10.545114022624743
But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . 5.914906615694153
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been <UNK> from the world , in some distant farm house . 15.709000684116855
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . 13.034575994634691
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned . 18.481571603577564
But we are all liable to error . 11.492720866973059
<UNK> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all . 12.59283256225467
She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . 19.565184113438217
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , <UNK> had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 13.950941390948053
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her <UNK> intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . 13.070230888826599
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 6.501680620179346
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . " " <UNK> out , " said Mrs . 8.129637477160836
I . 1.7219835220878055
Lord ! 6.441258020886149
I congratulate her . 4.072407266064032
" But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . " Elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . 13.74253240550016
The first week of their return was soon gone . 10.186130014318827
They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . " " <UNK> a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . 17.697653225223586
Jane was not happy . 4.063080062814066
It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> . 12.541028393994614
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . 9.679751731086725
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . " " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " And how impossible in others ! " " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? " " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . 15.539249052505946
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the <UNK> of red <UNK> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 21.584204702772258
And poor Mr . Darcy ! 6.699430686661014
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it . 8.945626812211318
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of <UNK> was delightful to her , and she began her song . 21.286791838879918
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . 16.961192757291748
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach . 18.748515070452147
But still he would be her husband . Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . 25.73634853001592
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . 15.778286528340521
They must all go to Brighton . 7.362260437456575
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 10.183957555245431
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . 20.89386240633356
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? 12.354219645483392
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that <UNK> is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . 15.427233201315731
Bennet . 2.346798422130704
intending to trace their route . 14.750929388998914
Bennet , " that is very unlucky . " " Can I have the carriage ? " said Jane . 6.350126810996339
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 11.097993796065213
Mr . Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . 19.95028141377429
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 5.226430312054767
Elizabeth felt Jane ' s pleasure . 6.609422207300185
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him . 35.78550584835722
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 11.957136630821402
You see how continually we are engaged there . 14.739197709001065
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . 24.761609949006356
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . 12.793012612709326
how acutely did she now feel it . 10.6467380861596
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 10.909596731450133
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . 14.506895164148624
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . 16.9738640086778
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . 12.507172153087083
<UNK> away the letter immediately and <UNK> a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . " " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . 12.575040683948112
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 11.33456944278094
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 13.484456543638371
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . " " And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the <UNK> of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! 13.11680902143818
But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my <UNK> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . 21.601085425347357
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <UNK> . 13.474887226202773
But the case is this . 4.9226899191804705
" Oh ! 3.9535946941154325
<UNK> and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was <UNK> and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . 16.07509418365021
He was received by Mrs . 5.38994397066982
I shall never forget her appearance this morning . 10.315339248116675
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . 9.087433350695695
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . " " I would wish not to be hasty in <UNK> any one ; but I always speak what I think . " " I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder . 11.14926082384808
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . " Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . 18.050163827120468
" I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . 9.579162885519588
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . 14.9095232708213
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . 11.55023457995537
Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and <UNK> her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family . 13.35109019120836
These were the contents " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . 20.947096445839605
They followed her into the dining parlour . 11.790375710767671
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement . 23.87477102247688
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . 11.326807446034204
" He only told me , what I have now told you . " Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart <UNK> with indignation . 10.752777453468015
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 22.34454683245237
" E . 3.323815115874164
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . 8.06444486083306
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 17.691801143516905
We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation . 15.785373399827188
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . 17.02964905418223
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . 16.336658660419594
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 14.952300034262775
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . " " To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 10.971354359089904
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . 9.166224422295494
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . 9.886913762394661
how unlucky ! 8.305338117759204
Reynolds was of no trifling nature . 10.584651394110907
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 7.2543014580142655
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . 16.310826998933013
Elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . 16.191240934949846
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . 15.409845185963642
You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! 16.2057372227186
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . 8.897440103693231
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . 22.56135949229258
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 9.08807332976833
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . 7.279378804788544
He has the promise of an <UNK> in General ' s regiment , now quartered in the North . 17.809439457810573
I know you will contrive it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . 13.003053726011727
To Mr . and Mrs . 3.6219522480436335
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? 19.64499383214394
Not that I care about it , though . 6.520842109363142
" ' Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much . 8.811136698990206
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 14.056146466573697
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 6.0844389353862915
I am not to be <UNK> into anything so wholly unreasonable . 16.537645457267537
But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came . 16.76233438996972
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 11.566796644596666
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . 11.294779972386118
Any other inconsistencies with modern <UNK> have been left as printed . 36.17571084170639
and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! 7.61734174469657
Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> . 22.52338758356557
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence . 15.777217111090614
It was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch street by noon . 16.28353848682229
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . " Her father lifted up his eyes . 12.634782326982112
Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 13.652278775962973
Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . 17.477022384749535
" I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ' s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . 12.632044097869608
No one but Mrs . 5.578041702149952
At present I will say nothing about it . " " You are quite right . 10.186470528954061
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw <UNK> in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . 17.45776412521635
Forster . 3.325754734541115
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 10.970213689555814
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . 9.736521849901326
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 10.820535750495683
By nature <UNK> , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James ' s had made him <UNK> . 27.44896033520154
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . 9.722336293217763
Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself . 15.414138610335936
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . 10.67792948846749
Is not general incivility the very <UNK> of love ? " " Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . 13.223276468826052
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish . 20.295612377252848
But here he was set right by Mrs . 9.173843584078595
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . 11.819271628193029
Gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . 11.684314476275278
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 8.167256367924177
See paragraph . C below . 21.68257987541676
Bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . 10.830516403256475
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . 19.352623510788266
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Shall you like to have such a brother ? " " Very , very much . 8.371898039828737
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . 15.524726036588229
" Well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " What say you to the day ? 7.512630974969438
Lakes , mountains , and <UNK> , shall not be <UNK> together in our <UNK> ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . 34.18747495338548

But on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . 11.852417092116838
" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam . 17.80992303415967
But I am at his disposal . 6.872055450715959
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . 15.490129640650276
Mr . Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . 12.656279256722462
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 13.912521220619922
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 15.490541708367523
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr . Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent . 14.641615931179205
When the ladies were <UNK> for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> . 14.929766394655992
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 14.088505775905796
She has a very good notion of <UNK> , though her taste is not equal to Anne ' s . 14.49746450626949
Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . 6.684110504386299
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . 15.028942658977885
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for <UNK> him also with Lizzy . 14.975020589751901
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out . She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . 15.864812080339927
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 13.595809972555992

Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 11.445892605851663
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> . 9.458635835818777
<UNK> you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters . 16.248781967237232
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <UNK> from the marriage of her sisters . 14.75582240084815
CHAPTER XIII . 7.654262124377574
Lydia ' s going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . 15.872244909978642
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it . 10.742658068051885
But , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 13.98493793300498
Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ' s arm <UNK> to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s . 15.13417208118811
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . " " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger . 14.656298274696391
<UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 14.769163259982815
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 14.324319624485193
Bennet ' s civilities . 6.249783974077995
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . 17.66585910619573
CHAPTER I . 3.1334467313064245
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 12.61044967737178
Bennet , who <UNK> with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be <UNK> enough . 16.24432975801404
He placed himself by her . 7.088341266702561
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 18.42988257925215
Mr . Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the <UNK> and go to sleep . 11.55966168646994
Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? 17.425419301190825
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold enough to say before how much I like him . 14.60187249200316
" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam . 11.264717757365458
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! 20.34961578284557
Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their <UNK> in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . 16.915764611341043
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . 14.32070343487832
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . 17.52572690803359
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . 15.516263737184254
It will pass away soon enough . " " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty . 13.751604740224309
The <UNK> and yet the noise ; the <UNK> and yet the self importance of all these people ! What would I give to hear your <UNK> on them ! " " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . 22.766448738299687
His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 15.27910023575396
If she does not object to it , why should we ? " " Her not objecting , does not justify him . 11.306050273451136
He was the <UNK> , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . 12.663718979922221
They soon <UNK> the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . 8.415089841780551
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 18.923233278096905
Well ! 5.179299686932784
She is quite a little creature . 7.787215318858732
She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 12.970858517964658
The day of his and Lydia ' s departure soon came , and Mrs . 7.669932078186405
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <UNK> infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . 23.67771383486793
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <UNK> society . " " But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . " " Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . 15.340723215470842
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> ! 10.474688022004761
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . 18.108374118548795
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . 14.684552439151634
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . 15.945985240963182
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . 14.356096227401682
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 22.33085732588103
Their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse . 13.516038098455995
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her <UNK> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . 19.09200525490476
Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s <UNK> , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any <UNK> of sentiment . If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error . 19.955204969814208
I never saw such a long <UNK> in my life . 11.6660825530469
CHAPTER X . 7.654260973594331
The garden <UNK> to the road , the house standing in it , the <UNK> pales and the <UNK> <UNK> , every thing declared they were <UNK> . 25.718090748806087
You will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . " He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit <UNK> long . 14.540835238512676
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ' s character . " Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " <UNK> there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 18.482904703057184
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever . " Darcy was fixed in astonishment . 11.634979303400312
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . " <UNK> as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat <UNK> , she had all the success she expected . 20.331986212924708
But are you pleased , Jane ? 6.535453322352562
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 16.451228824907545
I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too . 5.7873008450102885
" And is this all ? " cried Elizabeth . 5.599223460641329
Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . " " No , no . 5.283014879320262
It was gratitude . <UNK> , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <UNK> and <UNK> of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 22.350441960436363
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 17.880178758168753
Oh , Lydia ! " " I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 8.737178292883588
Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant <UNK> to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " I do not know . I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult . 9.213498375620922
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . 9.879904316976734
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . 8.754592038274
Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . 14.753715269348028
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . 17.246094439734797
" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . 10.243458592421353
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 16.385488438467824
Could there be finer symptoms ? 22.058558146409865
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the <UNK> kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . 14.037714640405204
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? " A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and <UNK> and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . 22.38679597459596
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with <UNK> civility , " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ? 16.6292489229793
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . 14.074569266465126
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . 16.830932733484428
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . 7.015644940910233
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal . " " True . 10.861495090213149
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . 8.34574832299328
I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " " And they must marry ! 10.463274393371835
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 15.18866700235179
I fancy she was wanted about the <UNK> <UNK> . 17.46700954190389
Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a <UNK> air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . 28.39535530929221
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . 11.746129782908838
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 15.458916125481457
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 11.118688140750509
When is your turn to come ? 9.340876686953077
Such was Miss Lucas ' s scheme ; and <UNK> were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . 17.998992287805756
I rather wonder now at your knowing any . " " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " I never saw such a woman . 13.259544019403839
His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . 14.05528325657367
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 19.31281620384192
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 6.384529587657676
I believe I have now told you every thing . 7.385432914093476
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 17.650034912943674
His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . 13.758891387726978
She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . Mr . Darcy said very little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all . 11.63938274789785
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <UNK> him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 21.540825942234054
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . " CHAPTER VI . 14.077978088471918
Oh , Lord ! 6.656226093891326
There is no indignity so <UNK> to their feelings ! " She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " " And quite alone ? 21.031100723746786
dear me ! 4.980170286458621
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 11.197078691361247
" How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . You think it a faithful <UNK> undoubtedly . " " I must not decide on my own performance . " He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . 15.789732218290705
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . 19.68570395832816
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 10.706488826663604
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 19.043879178260337
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united <UNK> . 21.622204909542575
This information , however , startled Mrs . 8.81557615773238
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . 16.736741702312145
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . 22.132157969360186
Mr . Darcy <UNK> it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . 14.40686010947734
Very nonsensical to come at all ! 12.453632245675111
" Your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . 14.276418983175384
I will read you the passage which particularly <UNK> me . 15.079619010228368
Philips ' s manners and politeness . 8.599747003657654
how he must have felt it ! " " I never saw any one so shocked . 9.336711086500998
His plan did not vary on seeing them . Miss Bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his <UNK> notions of what was due to <UNK> ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice . 25.067320134802436
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . 15.12652858356473
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . But good lord ! 12.298506777607825
At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . 7.253990868599427
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . 11.826299494093606
They had long wished to see him . 7.2770507583644415
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy . 11.953274947731282
As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . 10.83425627968533
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . 10.638918490089763
We have not met since the th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . " Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when <UNK> to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn . 17.11638563786117
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ' s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . 14.040285412640335
The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs . 8.77278331403975
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 24.04291416101465
" I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . 23.008151135796314
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 10.305676799256188
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . 13.674604787223535
I guessed as much . " And though he exclaimed at the <UNK> , she found that it had been pretty much the case . 11.976452965610413
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . 10.198128632293347
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . 17.56574334948941
He comes down on Thursday at the <UNK> , very likely on Wednesday . 19.55950982144747
" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living . 10.786756310282263
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . 11.037953038866176
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . " Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right . 13.827923036920701
Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 8.101806001179567
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . 15.902409093980662
This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better . 12.884065483763766
The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 14.94507429577066
Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better . 6.700941376068118
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ' s height , or rather <UNK> . " " How I long to see her again ! 13.401658551627461
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 15.53603265246733
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 21.938835456095784
Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . 9.667711023278907
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia . 14.030405181085355
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . 13.846945200146349
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ; but his <UNK> about the whole Pemberley family are endless . 21.351704490003133
Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by <UNK> to his sister . 12.973874628352306
what is it about ? 5.536849863339641
Mr . and Mrs . 2.441706632085952
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 16.99075099238666
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 13.03922997470162
She could not <UNK> him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . 10.269707089846039
That is the place to get husbands . 9.19630413068825
They walked on , without knowing in what direction . 10.531432844490578
" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently . 12.542003120122583
By this time she is actually with them ! 11.468471162287607
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 14.866817172687773
Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . 20.498900893999
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a <UNK> as this . 16.727966928839976
<UNK> as she was to admit an idea so <UNK> of Jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the <UNK> of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . 20.053511070231277
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself . 20.959782100368308
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 16.25695434098658
" They have both , " said she , " been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . 8.763683800786898
From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . 21.034185385925472
The vague and unsettled suspicions which <UNK> had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 21.001646660430584
How is half such a sum to be repaid ? " Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . 14.082438112931886
" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . " While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . 15.106820670832267
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned . 18.635956054477877
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . 17.310249815306182
" Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 11.502189575976386
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . 7.195992116110732
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . 11.587339069150156
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . 14.185435231702298
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 16.898496501149786
From what can it proceed ? 12.895792145244082
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . 9.506448982362791
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . " While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much <UNK> to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s . 21.41774494023087
My sisters may write to me . 7.869947982628677
They were in street . 5.846508840648555
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 20.783898408195597
They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! 11.436182722552157
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged . 13.15193369967675
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . 16.889943363217036
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 10.60364870753966
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 10.892171223986123
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " <UNK> in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . 14.142491139294071
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> . 21.15312225428625
Your ' s , c . 5.651294036952323
<UNK> , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ? 10.391867747638909
" And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . 8.492923291330685
" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 13.902355089440452
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self importance and humility . 22.329026602695688
Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her . 10.731425187759802
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 14.118163864573068
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 7.697551549104044
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . 15.16178741942386
I know how much you dislike him . " " You know nothing of the matter . 7.318326351314006
If you ' <UNK> believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 15.601813121706106
Miss Darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . 13.457160360254846
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 19.36886448052739
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
My mother was in <UNK> , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! 12.818974415687354
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . " Kitty , who took all these <UNK> in a serious light , began to <UNK> . 20.304247273529807
It is highly improper . 10.013663354010173
Hurst and Miss Bingley . 4.96762657791055
yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . 17.91666838927797
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 13.048935105392108
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . 15.971875035261595
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . 16.352865113376513
Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . 8.234859354206803
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 14.065989071019894
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 21.281177074204408
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . 10.803537931518713
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <UNK> with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 16.125846711352395
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley . 9.491492825553452
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 10.96975508869388
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . 12.442570484975729
That such a consequence as this should <UNK> , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . " " When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . " " Not the slightest . 13.956548904153163
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the <UNK> of the first . 17.831353126494722
<UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her . 18.134071631482843
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . 12.76277095915528
In the first place , she persisted in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might be broken off . 15.945749659972329
If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 12.097676206987048
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two . 11.588543948140359
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . 10.438660705718554
He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia . 13.138201927427502
She continued in very <UNK> reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 20.81539811866895
<UNK> and <UNK> support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg tm ' s <UNK> and <UNK> that the Project Gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come . 56.62135260831639
" Can you come to morrow ? " Yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 11.965568746492838
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 14.224938390557467
Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s sufferings . 17.0687585313966
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . 17.420349781549373
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . 14.509098613420917
so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! 10.879060090218672
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 7.699051893769512
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . 18.36131033551168
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . 8.473964958041412
Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in <UNK> . 17.002185076563343
CHAPTER XII . 7.654260973594331
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 17.451984042850476
Jenkinson ' s room . 6.636485085577166
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 8.750650927657778
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley . 11.755164030721476
" My dear , dear aunt , " she <UNK> cried , " what delight ! 9.601469189394306
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , <UNK> my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " " It is well . 11.925533301974118
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . 18.35482039362958
Well , but now for my news it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? 10.921428129077757
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . 16.392637343769508
But I confess they would have no charms for me . 10.012191892629097
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . " " My beauty you had early <UNK> , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . 14.168488956093292
He had to be sure done much . 5.8101299160371145
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 16.364375722954616
Many small donations to , are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the <UNK> . 39.06231602342067
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 14.276708756981618
" While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . 11.163343333749637
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 17.055471706922415
Though Lydia ' s short letter to Mrs . 9.46923953658934
Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . " " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget . 17.828742487536662
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 15.268836175511366
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 20.187348190908306
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . 15.213543194127505
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that <UNK> is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . 31.31868701851208
. F . . F . . Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees <UNK> considerable effort to <UNK> , do copyright research on , <UNK> and <UNK> public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg tm collection . 43.704001621673896
He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable house . 11.014152422709728
<UNK> wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . 13.890371323686088
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 14.665212320802942
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . 9.486494057002549
His debts are to be paid , <UNK> , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased . 17.39272454144253
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening . 14.9518254561049
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 17.973777427132912
It became her turn to listen . 9.68484543462854
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . " " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . " " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " I am not . " Lady Catherine seemed pleased . 13.056821984944335
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what <UNK> his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 14.231754116875251
" There is nothing the matter with me . 6.267947361965901
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . 11.837224000893043
Bennet was <UNK> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and <UNK> in her <UNK> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the <UNK> happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 20.200008956294543
His revenge would have been complete indeed . 15.492024491869376
" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . 15.552634821676508
It was all conjecture . " " What is it you mean ? " " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing . " " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . " " And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . 12.319013959848819
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 21.684255396998026
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid . 33.169900200239496
Indeed he has no improper pride . 13.677569866116443
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 28.086899549461528
He was full of joy and attention . 7.70363337799973
" I am , dear Sir , c . 5.020202324091581
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? 31.462848136302497
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 7.761122827212696
She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . 18.039995076359585
I hope they will not meet at all . 6.563532302331216
But will they make you happy ? " " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " <UNK> at all . 11.429575814555012
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . 9.720588002620923
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . 14.871175473305152
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . 13.660512827001876
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband . 16.237770833823728
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not <UNK> , but haughty . 16.223864205460185
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins . 11.207799874912281
I know not what to think . 3.95453180953377
Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time . 5.707646402817355
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . 14.502045453770522
Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father . 15.757057759426326
Very well . 5.346737238797884
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . 8.802386101117282
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . 17.011530243047968
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . 21.609890003612612
They could describe an entertainment with <UNK> , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . 26.208163539258326
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 17.18067922306386
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . 11.32432335112658
If there were but such another man for you ! " " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . 11.238250163476325
GARDINER . " " Is it possible ! " cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . 8.91257856624962
The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in <UNK> and <UNK> , and the evening at one of the <UNK> . 16.703554449422008
What is your own opinion ? " " That it ought not to be attempted . 10.143479028387151
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . 12.363434989123304
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 23.44987882304445
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . " He is now gone into the army , " she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . " Mrs . 14.185744126208252
" Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . 8.468167504694591
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 17.43685929210334
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . 13.635814777807695
His reception however was of the most flattering kind . 12.315365462941758
And what sort of table do they keep ? 13.492399877462304
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . 15.56968288922172
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 17.626316883592036
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 15.156578121411822
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . 13.300642685609827
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . 10.680025377177502
If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was <UNK> done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . With respect to that other , more <UNK> <UNK> , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only <UNK> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 20.970473597823354
Lord bless me ! 14.514182217514211
A fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . 12.13774670477262
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . 14.592196608514282
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that . 11.802706286337534
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 11.417277738543975
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 17.23795646729334
Elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 17.752291137986408
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . 15.304231200068202
They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <UNK> <UNK> and head <UNK> there is not much the matter with me . 23.84608445905874
The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . 15.281981132002665
Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits <UNK> high . 14.072729882194432
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . " " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister . 14.418547690831964
Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . 14.624460974575163
A house in town ! 8.918726942315917
They will ruin your happiness . 10.323010717939065
But who was your mother ? 6.779968396767647
This cannot be ! engaged to Mr . Darcy ! 7.658341642971365
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a <UNK> space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . 13.857823190452581
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 7.502907065767249
Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? 22.733624618265885
Good Heaven ! 11.889366076924157
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 13.348634792480723
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the <UNK> , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening . 16.287882704333747
Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 13.012764963741633
Hurst ' s gown " Here she was interrupted again . 13.652631780228054
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 14.341629323498552
But my dear Lydia , I don ' t at all like your going such a way off . 14.340722383061546
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 13.623827454433506
You alluded to something else . 9.604630051040948
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . 9.695694339472801
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you . 10.93290793802533
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . 15.936633199256656
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s foot <UNK> , that she said , ' Mr . Collins , you must marry . 15.20780287754342
<UNK> the works from public domain <UNK> editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works , so the Foundation and you ! can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties . 44.62138464687527
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . 20.536598193283332
Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority . 18.991936013972836
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 17.737175851825
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 13.91852363936992
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . 18.209959468041184
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 18.009904248957397
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . 14.70257953862905
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . 19.14440674632072
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <UNK> ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 21.156840249322237
I am most seriously displeased . " Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . 16.828031216008934
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 16.74556524888752
Such were the gentle <UNK> of Mrs . 12.916522394793262
For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . 14.472890188076889
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . 16.464156082304875
A regard for the <UNK> would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . 23.439100800735048
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . 11.190877803252192
He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , <UNK> friend . 12.929006485641546
my sweetest Lizzy ! 10.533884584393354
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time . 8.416004101086145
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 14.701439864120394
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . 15.58040745126411
I know your disposition , Lizzy . 5.631501354761671
" From what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs . 6.808447457017559
I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 20.031950985072502
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 8.466570220526293
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to <UNK> the engagements that had been made for him . 20.128975593514163
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . 15.86975706325823
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 19.801089996689576
So much the better . 6.137490217645997
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will <UNK> excite . 24.102856398084324
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ' s beauty . 13.067057610588897
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . 9.0005944926538
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must <UNK> him from such <UNK> misconduct as I have suffered by . 13.806101642175822
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <UNK> . 17.429982731250238
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would <UNK> his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . 20.29854702363786
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . 10.347178309879576
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . 18.108897750341917
Her father <UNK> by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and <UNK> mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . 24.270014835898884
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . 16.519482754156318
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . 12.739056835814255
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 23.014180388737405
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . 13.202290548686344
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 16.287532739087755
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish . 11.927387783435842
I have a high respect for your nerves . 10.048980449319323
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her <UNK> of Mrs . 11.219466190040096
" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s <UNK> in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . 15.192822641555592
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley . 11.082763533108091
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child . 14.856808763708935
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . 12.30945194530299
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley ' s <UNK> on fine eyes . 12.74776195108998
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . 16.429597598161106
If I wished to think <UNK> of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however . " " If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . " " Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . " " This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . 12.329273743699957
" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . " " Is my father in town ? " " Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . " " And have you heard from him often ? " " We have heard only once . 11.949873202051766
But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . 18.54641066099931
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . 6.7698597672751095
You mentioned two instances . 11.82585046661443
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . 22.507786526918032
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . 11.812772784772472
But don ' t imagine it was from any silly cause . 18.516814672767804
Come be quick , be quick ! 12.0021196975819
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . 14.160237300924893
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> . 15.716446352584818
She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . 13.175574762756824
Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . 11.311378970121773
From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 21.983717070169416
A clear ten thousand per annum . 35.22648022033055
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 15.932770776908656
Where shall you change horses ? Oh ! 21.471167003307038
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 12.29103981711753
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 7.36044353109156
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company . 13.188713729532518
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . " It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . 23.072582060639274
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . 15.104003804922316
CHAPTER <UNK> . 9.330650692533268
END OF VOL . 18.550515436978106
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of <UNK> . " He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . 13.708361234728178
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 7.179000209712617
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 12.036237952214883
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 14.045764029853594
Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . 11.206580008786228
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . 17.56214870847216
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . " " Lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . " " I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a <UNK> of character . 13.861214333112082
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals . 13.10644710460245
" I am sorry it went off . 7.008660786368389
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . 10.678964418573177
Jane <UNK> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour . 11.640104383657524
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . " " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . " " Pride , " observed Mary , who <UNK> herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe . 13.85396832551301
" You are <UNK> , Lizzy . 7.402712864082398
Is not he a charming man ? 9.584483181709876
In this <UNK> state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 17.15869259690904
It would be dreadful ! 8.050170782722203
She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 11.523480905011658
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . " " She is a very fine looking woman ! 8.281351835056503
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 18.345268583709615
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 19.17975528181492
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <UNK> family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . 20.909199333001382
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . 14.506597089756498
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . 8.76189217405003
Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . 11.480007325877011
His disposition must be dreadful . " " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . " Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from <UNK> , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! " " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; <UNK> of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same <UNK> care . 16.91466434454304
" Did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ? 6.763129314178435
Your <UNK> must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance . 16.91267777345868
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . 16.6492693477134
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . " She was then proceeding to all the particulars of <UNK> , muslin , and <UNK> , and would shortly have <UNK> some very <UNK> orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted . 20.466255587519786
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . " " Oh ! " said Lydia <UNK> , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , I ' <UNK> the <UNK> . " The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . 13.612785967560976
Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously . " Mrs . 16.440146867508254
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon <UNK> deliberation , you find that the misery of <UNK> his two sisters is more than <UNK> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . " " How can you talk so ? " said Jane <UNK> smiling , " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . " " I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . " " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 16.856972461972536
Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a <UNK> to buy clothes for his daughter . 17.226161284016897
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears <UNK> the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the <UNK> . 19.707418351372084
I depend on you for that . " To these high <UNK> expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the <UNK> of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . 14.798011270810187
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 13.570161009030604
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 14.034973551434422
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . " " I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 20.493157034632404
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 10.375730912476604
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them . 14.237119543706312
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . 12.789452616574186
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley ' s heart were entertained . 18.84202350675669
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 23.836196024019735
You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not . 6.8862877511169875
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . 10.575635049785342
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
I write rather slowly . " " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! 13.722791659166157
Gardiner smiled . 5.7644365157793835
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should <UNK> an occasion of <UNK> his respect towards any body connected with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared . Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . 21.280836649468093
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit . 14.278811486307589
" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir . 9.992166167122308
But I dare not hope it . 5.550645624542193
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 17.760331938159812
A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it <UNK> from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . 18.875677552350194
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as <UNK> of derivative works , <UNK> , <UNK> and research . 37.70953763490234
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . 7.263532469976383
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " Ah ! 14.970603747140228
Pray forgive me , if I have been very <UNK> , or at least do not punish me so far , as to <UNK> me from <UNK> . 19.49291202865636
Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and <UNK> . 15.016265413812688
GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . 11.275167193312246
Her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . 18.176231476471422
Their manners are not equal to his . " " Certainly not ; at first . 8.268443018386314
After walking several miles in a <UNK> manner , and too <UNK> to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their <UNK> , that it was time to be at home . 17.722248603723553
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <UNK> circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her <UNK> and steady candour always <UNK> for <UNK> , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 26.933519887408135
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and <UNK> them , after a short <UNK> , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . 23.68489880610204
CHAPTER VI . 7.65426164366213
Bennet , having <UNK> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . 23.877510038800388
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . 19.93282361959972
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 11.913718027261936
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled . " A gentleman and a stranger ! 13.104166072085917
Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . 8.762678595473947
" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . 6.70390173494449
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 11.815064624528622
" When my eyes were opened to his real character . Oh ! 12.082465412040076
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . 10.314394992743802
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 10.3634831749952
Mr . Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . 16.979143915429226
He cannot know what Mr . Darcy is . " " <UNK> not ; but Mr . Darcy can please where he chuses . 10.710530812559902
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 16.276390118398393
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 16.49732594658315
But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! 9.488093974641806
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . 8.18674743802168
Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley <UNK> with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . 19.209746997299856
You provide , in accordance with paragraph . F . , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and <UNK> to you within days of receipt of the work . 21.62232243750108
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes <UNK> , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . 17.359825408172888
I hate such false friends . 11.001848130262085
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
Bennet very dull for several days . 12.610295019759581
" Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . 19.186906330576825
But your family owe me nothing . 10.02166968822956
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . 13.112737895239981
It was over at last however . 6.974831049086421
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 20.326966473338807
Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in Mrs . 11.550128375239476
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <UNK> recommendation , and to assert that I had <UNK> all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . 17.946030965339453
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . 12.140844583125498
They have some of the finest woods in the country . " Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <UNK> . 12.29677544410898
He was very fond of them . " This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham ' s being among them . 9.813871913058422
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 10.30054772804172
How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! 14.502942789556526
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 17.242887088780364
And who knows what may happen ? 16.832515248161545
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . 20.317904231337042
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 14.192082497546215
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 16.310226523664255
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . 13.678812847590768
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 17.60500665510831
A clergyman like you must marry . <UNK> properly , chuse a <UNK> for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . 22.864841164396335
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 15.937962809583487
My temper I dare not vouch for . It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world . 17.573005854787514
She had even learnt to <UNK> , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a <UNK> to disgust and weary . 18.71378541901424
Oh , Lizzy ! 5.0105061389543835
Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . 12.221169799562823
Oh ! 4.433688494507245
He studies too much for words of four <UNK> . Do not you , Darcy ? " " My style of writing is very different from yours . " " Oh ! " cried Miss Bingley , " Charles <UNK> in the most careless way imaginable . 20.92152107554929
Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . " Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . 14.678551364052788
But vanity , not love , has been my folly . <UNK> with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . 15.8249894085415
He is come Mr . Bingley is come . He is , indeed . 6.448047875817717
Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . 14.901410223213388
Jenkinson to make up her party . 7.982185755815223
Such a countenance , such manners ! 9.693933544602146
" <UNK> in other words , you are determined to have him . 8.567710140437558
I am impatient to see him . " " In point of <UNK> , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective . 11.740353957632498
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . " " But my father cannot . He wrote last week to hurry my return . " " Oh ! 15.185894949278005
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a <UNK> table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the <UNK> of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . 18.817972677667317
Had it been your uncle ' s doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . 19.342482740126663
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . 9.583083792737552
On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . 24.339958728589597
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 15.518889756171955
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . 9.442057337575399
" DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations . 12.369856716202856
I cannot do justice to his kindness . 7.568865907059262
Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon <UNK> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 26.18802497252132
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . 16.883761553374967
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two . 16.92471459844773
sir , I do indeed . 5.46262329320401
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few <UNK> , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <UNK> . " Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 22.063787440893677
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of <UNK> whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to <UNK> , she began to regret that he came . 16.38242660157389
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . 17.758088560619353
Now what have you to say ? " " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . " Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . 12.437313877599596
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! 8.0415607275129
I am not <UNK> you know . 7.355593721386585
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 21.265685294269634
I have no pleasure in talking to <UNK> children . Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body . 13.80619568658576
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him . 18.33001858964456
" Oh ! 3.9535946941154325
Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> . 15.143167794274946
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . 13.850372268472729
CHAPTER III . 7.414109323913755
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? 18.05763729821904
" Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . " " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . " " Oh ! 10.803281140077816
Hill began instantly to express her joy . 15.023911436086077
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , <UNK> painful to me . 11.328668507249684
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 12.70206200750119
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a <UNK> of emotion they excited . 15.549509344571488
Mrs . 2.3244201675878884
" Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " for Mrs . 5.135504642782469
To Mr . Bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 16.72333974997201
CHAPTER VII . 7.65426164366213
Did he know of their intending to go off ? 13.028180527832184
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . 10.082902546597417
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater <UNK> than first <UNK> often boast ; and so <UNK> did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were <UNK> to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 20.908136165476158
Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley . 12.670903888513186
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . 15.616370625815438
" How could you begin ? " said she . 6.353381840122787
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 16.441193003918876
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 13.502949531258997
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 10.949296919893712
In that case he would return no more . 9.020816403741613
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . 18.83175234274962
Elizabeth now began to <UNK> . 9.168837397329003
Annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs . 17.866988214574786
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> . 13.072011981176908
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 9.802063537734723
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 22.59678292759116
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago . " " I have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said Mrs . 12.578712268006536
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! 11.746073600588277
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is <UNK> the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken <UNK> , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . 16.35127624934613
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever . 14.014118631230083
What will Wickham say ? 8.723574325748288
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the <UNK> girls in the country . 16.854440604466728
There was another reason too for her opposition . 11.958893786756786
No thanks to his gallantry for that . 8.339101939230222
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . 13.853964327135037
I thought we never should have got into the coach . 11.286593573648833
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 12.814769724843071
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention . 13.186000077036097
CHAPTER XVI . 7.654260973594331
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 13.916665241126386
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . 10.035003397100562
How strange must it appear to him ! 10.83443015737108
<UNK> , of course . If you mention my name at the <UNK> , you will be attended to . " Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . 14.41539673815864
Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c . 11.057385184723135
" Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair . 5.20431679048262
" I am trying to make it out . " " And what is your success ? " She shook her head . 9.990701886945697
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 18.064169428849095
Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley ' s continued absence . 9.66722850079412
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 17.011564218460887
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 9.768175445782935
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 19.08287740597884
When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . " " Your plan is a good one , " replied Elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . 14.034178185261512
Bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . 14.473953914141651
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . 14.87122802848349
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . 14.044053223405598
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 18.471963731851034
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . 17.507015466850504
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 8.930242224674824
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . 10.940711425850894
Who could about such a <UNK> little <UNK> thing ? " Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <UNK> and fancied liberal ! 29.822556827288654
You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . 12.802124177306018
Mr . Bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is <UNK> with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . " She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . 16.50431758490115
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . 14.122774770787194
They <UNK> their wretchedness , however , by <UNK> after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . 25.842409252474237
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh . 10.969828169267311
Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 9.645154181117709
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " CHAPTER <UNK> . 19.612504410323346
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . 10.985898325211801
" A man who has once been refused ! 14.76993604688271
Her answer , therefore , was not <UNK> , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . 9.984812678634583
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 17.36890226960476
Consider Mr . Collins ' s respectability , and Charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . 13.5695555247908
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 11.769312066356125
<UNK> to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . 20.52839447453833
