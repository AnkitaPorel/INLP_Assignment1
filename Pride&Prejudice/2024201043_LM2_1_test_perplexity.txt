Mrs . 100000.00000000001
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 1.93069772888325
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . 2.2758459260747883
They are wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? " " They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . " " But if you have got them to day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered . " She did at last <UNK> from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . 1.3708385261355818
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs . 17.78279410038923
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . 6.812920690579612
Collins ' s <UNK> of meat were too large for her family . 5.878016072274914
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other . 3.593813663804627
She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . 1.557068404753731
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . 1.557068404753731
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <UNK> shewn . 1.7301957388458942
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . 2.51188643150958
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Dear me ! 2154.4346900318833
Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master . 3.593813663804627
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 1.778279410038923
" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . 4.216965034285822
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 1.93069772888325
She longed to see Mrs . 46.415888336127786
" Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal <UNK> , you last night laid to my charge . 2.51188643150958
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 1.5998587196060583
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 2.2122162910704493
They contained no actual <UNK> , nor was there any <UNK> of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 2.8480358684358014
Bennet , who <UNK> with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be <UNK> enough . 1.6876124757881477
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . 2.7213387683753076
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . " " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley . 1.8047217668271702
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , <UNK> love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means <UNK> , though it could not be exactly defined . 1.4873521072935114
Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley <UNK> with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . 1.8329807108324359
I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too . 5.179474679231212
Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the <UNK> ? 1.8329807108324359
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 2.4244620170823286
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . 6.812920690579612
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . " This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . 1.4412195967188537
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . 2.9935772947204895
We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . 2.2758459260747883
Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 2.346228848142263
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 17.78279410038923
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room . 2.0535250264571463
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . 3.359818286283782
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you . 1.632172128563275
" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . " While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . 1.778279410038923
Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes . 1.9684194472866121
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . 1.3894954943731377
<UNK> people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . 10.000000000000002
By tea time however the <UNK> had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . 1.7082763938087104
But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . 1.8632463119315603
You deserve no such attention . 46.415888336127786
<UNK> laws in most <UNK> are in a constant state of change . 5.878016072274914
On finding Mrs . 316.22776601683796
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her <UNK> , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . 1.5998587196060583
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
The morrow produced no <UNK> of Mrs . 17.78279410038923
You refuse , then , to oblige me . 12.915496650148839
He was <UNK> for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have <UNK> it . 2.51188643150958
Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it . 3.593813663804627
I am not equal to it . 26.82695795279726
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . 2.7213387683753076
There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . 2.9935772947204895
She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 10.000000000000002
In this <UNK> state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 1.3830728955554412
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 4.641588833612778
Most earnestly did she <UNK> to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . 2.7213387683753076
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . 2.1017480113324885
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said . 1.93069772888325
CHAPTER XIII . 2154.4346900318833
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 8.11130830789687
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . 2.51188643150958
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . 1.16957266874034
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 4.641588833612778
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference . 6.812920690579612
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 1.5706464294715548
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <UNK> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 1.4677992676220695
Society has claims on us all ; and I <UNK> myself one of those who consider intervals of <UNK> and amusement as desirable for every body . " Elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak <UNK> to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from <UNK> a <UNK> either from the <UNK> , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by <UNK> to dance . 1.1921636558879274
" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently . 3.593813663804627
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . 1.4497406703726319
<UNK> that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . 2.9935772947204895
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went <UNK> against the <UNK> ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <UNK> <UNK> , and give the praise where it was due . 1.333521432163324
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 2.346228848142263
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . 1.778279410038923
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 3.593813663804627
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <UNK> than to herself . 6.812920690579612
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction . 5.179474679231212
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 1.8329807108324359
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . 2.154434690031884
" Oh ! 2154.4346900318833
See paragraph . E below . 46.415888336127786
I am so grieved for him . 26.82695795279726
I only hope they may have half my good luck . 8.11130830789687
Mr . Collins made his declaration in form . 12.915496650148839
But we must <UNK> the tide of malice , and <UNK> into the wounded <UNK> of each other , the <UNK> of sisterly consolation . " Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " <UNK> as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is <UNK> that one false step <UNK> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <UNK> than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 1.2005080577484075
" I found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr . Darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . " She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . 1.2175031274276027
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their <UNK> concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 2.51188643150958
He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would <UNK> more birds on the first of <UNK> , than any body else in the country . 2.0535250264571463
You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs . 8.11130830789687
" Oh ! 2154.4346900318833
Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . 3.1622776601683795
You are not going to be <UNK> , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . 2.9935772947204895
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 1.338388753173757
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . 8.11130830789687
You must learn some of my philosophy . 17.78279410038923
He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , <UNK> friend . 3.8746751204561316
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . " " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . " " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . 1.4677992676220695
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his <UNK> . 1.8957356524063758
There is one point , on which I want your advice . 6.812920690579612
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . 2.51188643150958
Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> . 1.778279410038923
Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . 1.7082763938087104
It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your ' s seems to have been . 2.51188643150958
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . The possibility of his having really endured such <UNK> , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained . 1.228247006346923
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance . 3.8746751204561316
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 3.359818286283782
have you heard from my uncle ? " " Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . " " Well , and what news does it bring ? 2.0535250264571463
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <UNK> them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 1.6496480740980204
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
how shall I bear so much happiness ! " She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty . 1.9684194472866121
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears <UNK> the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the <UNK> . 2.0535250264571463
It <UNK> , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . 1.365007806546014
You supposed more than really existed . 26.82695795279726
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 2.8480358684358014
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 2.154434690031884
Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion . 5.179474679231212
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . 8.11130830789687
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him . 4.216965034285822
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling . 1.6876124757881477
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 1.4773776525985112
Four nieces of Mrs . 100.00000000000004
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . 1.93069772888325
When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs . 8.11130830789687
CHAPTER XII . 2154.4346900318833
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . " She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . 1.7534865500829584
Why must she be <UNK> about the country , because her sister had a cold ? 4.216965034285822
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . 2.51188643150958
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> . 1.7534865500829584
CHAPTER I . 2154.4346900318833
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ' s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . 1.3433993325989002
shocking ! " cried Miss Bingley . 26.82695795279726
but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley ' s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the <UNK> have no horses to theirs . " " I had much rather go in the coach . " " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure . 1.53174046370208
I quite forgot ! 316.22776601683796
There was no want of discourse . 26.82695795279726
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater <UNK> than first <UNK> often boast ; and so <UNK> did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were <UNK> to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 1.28792362543363
Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . 3.1622776601683795
They would doubtless be <UNK> with the generality of female minds . 6.812920690579612
That is all to be forgot . 26.82695795279726
It is useless to talk of it . " It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . 2.2122162910704493
But I have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous <UNK> , boy in the world . " Elizabeth almost stared at her . " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she . 1.4773776525985112
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however <UNK> its existence might prove , had at least <UNK> one day . 1.319720393061375
Lydia ' s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , <UNK> engaged with one of the <UNK> <UNK> in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little <UNK> , of his house and garden at Hunsford . 1.2451970847350329
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe . 1.8047217668271702
You are a gentleman ' s daughter . 17.78279410038923
" Do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; " that is rather singular . " " Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " <UNK> cards . 2.0092330025650473
Mary was obliged to <UNK> more with the world , but she could still <UNK> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <UNK> between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <UNK> to the change without much <UNK> . 1.53174046370208
There could not <UNK> in the world two men , over whom Mr . Darcy could have such <UNK> influence . 2.9935772947204895
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! 4.216965034285822
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 1.7534865500829584
But your family owe me nothing . 26.82695795279726
" Good gracious ! " cried Mrs . 17.78279410038923
And is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? 5.878016072274914
" It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . 2.1017480113324885
Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . 1.8329807108324359
" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . 1.8632463119315603
If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go . 6.812920690579612
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head <UNK> acutely . 3.593813663804627
" But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . " Elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . 1.4873521072935114
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . 3.593813663804627
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of <UNK> to others . 2.51188643150958
But he is an ugly fellow ! 26.82695795279726
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been <UNK> by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 1.8047217668271702
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . 10.000000000000002
This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better . 1.615598098439874
In <UNK> lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <UNK> in this interference . 2.2122162910704493
" Good gracious ! 316.22776601683796
I will not tell you what it is . 12.915496650148839
Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 1.2679227183627855
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . 1.93069772888325
" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 1.4174741629268053
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels . 3.593813663804627
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my <UNK> from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . 2.7213387683753076
His revenge would have been complete indeed . 17.78279410038923
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 2.154434690031884
People do not die of little trifling <UNK> . 12.915496650148839
With the <UNK> concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 2.51188643150958
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 1.9684194472866121
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 2.7213387683753076
Miss Lucas is married and settled . 26.82695795279726
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . 2.0092330025650473
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . 1.7534865500829584
" Gracechurch street , <UNK> . 46.415888336127786
At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . 3.359818286283782
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle . 3.8746751204561316
But I must write no more . 26.82695795279726
This room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . 2.7213387683753076
The <UNK> was <UNK> to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so <UNK> a <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . 2.154434690031884
" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . 1.9684194472866121
Who could about such a <UNK> little <UNK> thing ? " Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <UNK> and fancied liberal ! 1.6496480740980204
He can be a <UNK> companion if he thinks it worth his while . 5.179474679231212
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to <UNK> , and was but slightly affected by his <UNK> of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the <UNK> altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh . 1.295267744355328
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 2.9935772947204895
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <UNK> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . 1.4677992676220695
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged . 2.1017480113324885
Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a <UNK> over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was <UNK> Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <UNK> . 1.4585940117250362
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " As Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <UNK> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 2.0092330025650473
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . 1.2154742500762865
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious <UNK> , denoted a recollection of Jane , not <UNK> by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . 1.5085907086001784
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . 3.8746751204561316
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . 3.8746751204561316
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . 1.93069772888325
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! 2.9935772947204895
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ' s height , or rather <UNK> . " " How I long to see her again ! 2.51188643150958
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs . 5.179474679231212
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would <UNK> his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . 1.3768571648527583
In a <UNK> voice Mrs . 46.415888336127786
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 12.915496650148839
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been <UNK> , and it had actually been <UNK> that Colonel Forster was going to be married . 1.5848931924611136
" How could you begin ? " said she . 10.000000000000002
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . 1.5706464294715548
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . 4.216965034285822
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 2.8480358684358014
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 1.319720393061375
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . 2.0092330025650473
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 4.641588833612778
On entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . 1.5085907086001784
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very <UNK> reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to <UNK> and <UNK> to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 1.1773944540970325
how he must have felt it ! " " I never saw any one so shocked . 3.8746751204561316
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . 8.11130830789687
" When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! I who knew what he was . 2.1017480113324885
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party . 5.878016072274914
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to <UNK> these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 1.615598098439874
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 2.1017480113324885
She comes to us to day . 26.82695795279726
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 2.0535250264571463
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 2.2122162910704493
They saw him often , and to his other <UNK> was now added that of general <UNK> . 3.593813663804627
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 2.610157215682537
Who should suffer but myself ? 46.415888336127786
Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an <UNK> sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she <UNK> him . 1.5848931924611136
Darcy may be guessed . 100.00000000000004
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in <UNK> to the proposal before him . 1.93069772888325
My dear Mr . Bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? 3.593813663804627
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . 2.9935772947204895
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . 1.615598098439874
But our visitor was very obstinate . 26.82695795279726
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern . 8.11130830789687
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . 1.8957356524063758
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . " Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where Mrs . 1.2648552168552962
" My dear , dear aunt , " she <UNK> cried , " what delight ! 4.216965034285822
You cannot have been always at Longbourn . " Elizabeth looked surprised . 5.878016072274914
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . 2.7213387683753076
Elizabeth was <UNK> enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 2.8480358684358014
She will be taken good care of . 17.78279410038923
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . 12.915496650148839
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in <UNK> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " said Jane as she finished it . 1.4773776525985112
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable . 2.4244620170823286
yes ; there is nothing in that . 17.78279410038923
yes , " said Elizabeth drily " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a <UNK> deal of care of him . " " <UNK> of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care . 1.53174046370208
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . " Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . 1.6681005372000588
There is nothing else to be done . 17.78279410038923
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another . 2.1017480113324885
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . 1.8329807108324359
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . " Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . 2.4244620170823286
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . 3.359818286283782
" We can all plague and punish one another . 10.000000000000002
Very nonsensical to come at all ! 26.82695795279726
From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 1.3830728955554412
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 3.8746751204561316
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 2.8480358684358014
My father bears it better . 46.415888336127786
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . " " No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me . 1.557068404753731
" She is my youngest girl but one . 12.915496650148839
what felicity ! 2154.4346900318833
That he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . 4.641588833612778
She had been <UNK> pleased to approve of both the <UNK> , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . 2.610157215682537
But will they make you happy ? " " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " <UNK> at all . 2.0092330025650473
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . 3.593813663804627
CHAPTER XIV . 2154.4346900318833
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . 4.216965034285822
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . 12.915496650148839
Every thing , however , went on <UNK> , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ' s first sketch . 2.9935772947204895
Poor dear child ! 316.22776601683796
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen . 4.641588833612778
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . 3.1622776601683795
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall <UNK> a list , according to his information . 2.154434690031884
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . 6.812920690579612
I had no notion but he would go a <UNK> , or something or other , and not <UNK> us with his company . 2.610157215682537
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " This was invitation enough . 2.8480358684358014
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose <UNK> of <UNK> support . 2.9935772947204895
I will try again . 100.00000000000004
His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . 2.4244620170823286
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company . 8.11130830789687
I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . 5.179474679231212
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . 1.5706464294715548
Philips ' s <UNK> was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs . 3.1622776601683795
" Then , who taught you ? 26.82695795279726
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . 4.641588833612778
He <UNK> how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an <UNK> manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there . 2.1017480113324885
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . 17.78279410038923
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 2.2122162910704493
Lydia , my love , ring the bell . 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to <UNK> her confidence in it . 2.0092330025650473
" Where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door . 3.8746751204561316
They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . 1.4330125702369627
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . " " For heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr . Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . " Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . 1.3593563908785256
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse . 12.915496650148839
" I cannot see why Mrs . 26.82695795279726
<UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . 2.51188643150958
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 2.4244620170823286
<UNK> such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 3.1622776601683795
The <UNK> <UNK> of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in <UNK> with her opinion of each . 1.5199110829529336
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 1.28792362543363
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! 5.179474679231212

When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . 8.11130830789687

" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried Jane . 4.216965034285822
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you . 2.7213387683753076
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up . 3.359818286283782
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some <UNK> in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . 1.302994338575022
It is admirable ! " Elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 2.51188643150958
Oh , Lydia ! " " I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 1.93069772888325
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 2.154434690031884
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . 4.216965034285822
Believe her to be deceived by all means . 12.915496650148839
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <UNK> and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " Wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of accents , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right . 1.1747083882399671
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> . 17.78279410038923
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . 10.000000000000002
" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . " " It is no such thing . 2.8480358684358014

She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . 2.2758459260747883
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her <UNK> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . 1.6496480740980204
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . 1.8957356524063758
CHAPTER XVI . 2154.4346900318833
<UNK> for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public <UNK> , but I wrote to Mr . Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
We will go round the Park every day . 12.915496650148839
I send no compliments to your mother . 17.78279410038923
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the <UNK> of his confidence in his friend . 2.1017480113324885
Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 2.154434690031884
Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a <UNK> to buy clothes for his daughter . 2.7213387683753076
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 1.615598098439874
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . 2.51188643150958
that he had <UNK> his <UNK> in the first dance ! " " Oh ! 4.641588833612778
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? 6.812920690579612
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . 4.641588833612778
CHAPTER XVI . 2154.4346900318833
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 1.4977474763452014
She was ashamed to think how much . 17.78279410038923
Forster . 100000.00000000001
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 2.0092330025650473
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 3.8746751204561316
Bennet by admiring Mrs . 100.00000000000004
Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . 2.346228848142263
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 2.154434690031884
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . 1.8957356524063758
Elizabeth , after slightly <UNK> it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . 4.216965034285822
You <UNK> me for coming ? " " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you . 2.0092330025650473
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 1.8957356524063758
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . 2.51188643150958
Lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 1.8329807108324359
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies . 5.179474679231212
They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . " " <UNK> a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . 1.3708385261355818
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? " " Nearly three weeks . " " And you saw him frequently ? " " Yes , almost every day . " " His manners are very different from his cousin ' s . " " Yes , very different . 1.4330125702369627
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . 2.8480358684358014
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . " " Oh ! 2.610157215682537
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage . 1.4773776525985112
They must have seen them together for ever . " " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . 1.8329807108324359
<UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? " " Yes ; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . 1.93069772888325
Elizabeth now began to <UNK> . 46.415888336127786
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 1.213482767749144
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 1.5706464294715548
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 2.4244620170823286
It would be such a <UNK> scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . 3.1622776601683795
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . 5.878016072274914
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself . 1.8047217668271702
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 2.154434690031884
I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister . 4.216965034285822
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . 4.641588833612778
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 2.7213387683753076
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . 10.000000000000002
She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . Mr . Darcy said very little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all . 1.632172128563275
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! 4.641588833612778
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and <UNK> , and talk and laugh all the way home . 3.1622776601683795
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement . 4.216965034285822
The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . 1.5441135899948315
Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . 3.359818286283782
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . 4.641588833612778
is she handsome ? " " She is a most charming young lady indeed . 4.641588833612778
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair . 1.7534865500829584
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 1.615598098439874
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the <UNK> curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two <UNK> of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . The envelope itself was likewise full . <UNK> her way along the lane , she then began it . 1.4412195967188537
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . 3.8746751204561316

Yes , yes . 316.22776601683796
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 2.4244620170823286
Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , <UNK> him I believe very early in life . 1.8329807108324359
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . 5.878016072274914
He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . " " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . 1.9684194472866121
" I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . " " Perhaps I do . 2.1017480113324885
" Your affectionate friend , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " Oh ! 5.878016072274914
mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to day ? 5.179474679231212
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them . 5.179474679231212
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . " Hunsford , near <UNK> , Kent , th <UNK> . DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . " There , Mrs . 1.176041196368325
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough . 4.216965034285822
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 4.216965034285822
Elizabeth merely <UNK> to him , without saying a word . 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 3.359818286283782
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . 3.359818286283782
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . 10.000000000000002
Their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse . 4.216965034285822
They were hopeless of remedy . 46.415888336127786
It was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch street by noon . 2.51188643150958
This is your <UNK> resolve ! 46.415888336127786
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 1.3768571648527583
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different <UNK> ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . 2.51188643150958
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at Longbourn . 2.610157215682537
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 3.1622776601683795
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . 2.610157215682537
Though our kind uncle has done something towards <UNK> him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . 2.2122162910704493
" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . 2.0535250264571463
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr . Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and <UNK> the prospects of Mr . Wickham . <UNK> and <UNK> to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a <UNK> , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the <UNK> of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the <UNK> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd . I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ' s accidental information , that Bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . 1.0696452479219232
But that is one great difference between us . 12.915496650148839
The hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . 2.346228848142263
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over <UNK> , as I always am . 2.51188643150958
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 1.353876180022544
" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? 6.812920690579612
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and <UNK> pass away . 1.93069772888325
I have by no means done . 26.82695795279726
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . " " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . 1.333521432163324
Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not <UNK> . 2.0535250264571463
In the dining room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before . 2.154434690031884
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side . 1.3593563908785256
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation . 3.1622776601683795

But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . 3.1622776601683795
To Mr . Bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 1.7534865500829584
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty . 5.179474679231212
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 1.7301957388458942
She has two nieces of her own . 17.78279410038923
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else ! 3.8746751204561316
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget ' had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ' Those were your words . 2.2758459260747883
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 1.4030037231905736
They crossed it by a <UNK> bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a <UNK> , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the <UNK> <UNK> wood which bordered it . 1.4585940117250362
" Yes if Darcy does not put it off again . 8.11130830789687
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a <UNK> of emotion they excited . 2.346228848142263
This son was to join in <UNK> off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . 1.9684194472866121
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . 4.216965034285822
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . 1.5706464294715548
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 1.9684194472866121
<UNK> , <UNK> , . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations . 3.8746751204561316
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . 3.359818286283782
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . 2.0092330025650473
I can hardly write for laughing . 26.82695795279726
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . 3.359818286283782
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished <UNK> of integrity or benevolence , that might <UNK> him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the <UNK> of virtue , atone for those <UNK> errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . 1.396135390856794
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 4.641588833612778
I do think Mrs . 100.00000000000004
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the per <UNK> . 1.7301957388458942
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented . 3.593813663804627
A lively imagination soon settled it all . 17.78279410038923
The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood . 3.8746751204561316
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little <UNK> by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . 1.53174046370208
In that case he would return no more . 12.915496650148839
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . " " My beauty you had early <UNK> , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . 1.5085907086001784
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton . 3.359818286283782
It would have suited me in every respect . " " How should you have liked making sermons ? " " <UNK> well . 2.610157215682537
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a <UNK> ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 1.53174046370208
When is your turn to come ? 26.82695795279726
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 1.7301957388458942
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 2.0092330025650473
Nor was Darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 2.9935772947204895
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . 5.179474679231212
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs . 1.778279410038923
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <UNK> , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . 2.0535250264571463
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <UNK> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . 1.5085907086001784
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 1.5706464294715548
But I will not repine . 46.415888336127786
" If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . 2.154434690031884
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " <UNK> so I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . 1.28792362543363
The discussion of Mr . Collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . 1.778279410038923
But you know married women have never much time for writing . 6.812920690579612
Bennet . " My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received <UNK> at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right <UNK> Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose <UNK> and <UNK> has preferred me to the valuable <UNK> of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <UNK> myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those <UNK> and <UNK> which are <UNK> by the <UNK> of England . 1.2589254117941673
" It may perhaps be pleasant , " replied Charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . 1.8632463119315603
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . 1.4174741629268053
Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ' s <UNK> enough to <UNK> him from its <UNK> , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never <UNK> without him . " " So much the better . 1.4677992676220695
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield . 2.8480358684358014
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 2.2758459260747883
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . 6.812920690579612
Bennet . 100000.00000000001
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 2.8480358684358014
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . " " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " " Has your governess left you ? " " We never had any governess . " " No governess ! 1.5441135899948315
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . " " I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 1.2238249369681928
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother How is she ? 2.2122162910704493
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . 1.778279410038923
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 1.632172128563275
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 1.7534865500829584
" And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 1.8329807108324359
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . 1.4330125702369627
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . 4.641588833612778
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 1.6496480740980204
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . 1.8329807108324359
But , alas ! 316.22776601683796
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so <UNK> . 2.4244620170823286
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . 4.216965034285822
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . " " <UNK> out , " said Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for <UNK> Lodge , the <UNK> are dreadful . " Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . 1.8047217668271702
in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 2.7213387683753076
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . 3.1622776601683795
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . 3.359818286283782
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . 2.7213387683753076
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that <UNK> is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . 1.5848931924611136
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " Oh ! 2.154434690031884
Gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . 4.216965034285822
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . 3.593813663804627
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 2.8480358684358014
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <UNK> with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 2.154434690031884
Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . 3.8746751204561316
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . 4.216965034285822
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . 2.7213387683753076
His brother in law , Mr . Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr . Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble <UNK> ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . 1.4412195967188537
What did Colonel Forster say ? 46.415888336127786
Kitty was the only one who <UNK> tears ; but she did <UNK> from vexation and envy . 3.593813663804627
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 1.6496480740980204
She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . 2.610157215682537
Society , I own , is necessary to me . 10.000000000000002
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . 3.8746751204561316
" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . 2.8480358684358014
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <UNK> your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter . 1.6681005372000588
You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg tm works . 3.593813663804627
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 4.641588833612778
It was over at last however . 26.82695795279726
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 2.154434690031884
<UNK> he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 2.2122162910704493
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <UNK> , distance becomes no evil . 3.8746751204561316
They then went away . 100.00000000000004
Mr . Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the <UNK> and go to sleep . 2.7213387683753076
Bennet and Mrs . 316.22776601683796
I know it to be impossible . " " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! 4.216965034285822
And poor Mr . Darcy ! 46.415888336127786
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 2.4244620170823286
I knew you would be wishing me joy . " " Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . 2.154434690031884
Wickham is safe . " " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . " " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane . 1.4677992676220695
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . 1.4497406703726319
She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . 1.425102670302998
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . 3.8746751204561316
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . 5.878016072274914
But let me advise you to think better of it . 8.11130830789687
" It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . 1.5706464294715548
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 2.346228848142263
Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 1.7082763938087104
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . 2.51188643150958
And a special licence . 100.00000000000004
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 1.5998587196060583
I rather wonder now at your knowing any . " " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " I never saw such a woman . 1.8329807108324359
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . 1.5998587196060583
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . 2.2122162910704493
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was . 2.51188643150958
Lydia ' s going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . 2.346228848142263
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child . 2.4244620170823286
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . " " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! 1.7534865500829584
" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . 6.812920690579612
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . 1.7301957388458942
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . 1.2710617996147449
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and <UNK> , though <UNK> families . 1.9684194472866121
But , Lizzy ! 316.22776601683796
Collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . 5.878016072274914
No thanks to his gallantry for that . 17.78279410038923
They must all go to Brighton . 26.82695795279726
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . 8.11130830789687
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . 2.9935772947204895
Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . 1.9684194472866121
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . " " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . " Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . 1.353876180022544
Gardiner . 100000.00000000001
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . 2.4244620170823286
Have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs . 8.11130830789687
For , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken <UNK> , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the <UNK> reproof . 2.2758459260747883
<UNK> or twice she could discern a <UNK> blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . 3.359818286283782
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . 2.0092330025650473
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs . 1.4330125702369627
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my <UNK> and <UNK> are not usually <UNK> by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of <UNK> ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . Pardon me . It pains me to offend you . 1.0907766915109554
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . 3.359818286283782
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs . 5.878016072274914
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 4.641588833612778
But slyness seems the fashion . 46.415888336127786
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph . 3.8746751204561316
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 3.8746751204561316
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . 4.641588833612778
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 1.6496480740980204
It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . 4.216965034285822
GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . 2.1017480113324885
Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the <UNK> of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . 1.6876124757881477
I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . 5.878016072274914
" Excuse my interference . It was kindly meant . " " <UNK> girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . 1.778279410038923
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . 4.216965034285822
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 2.154434690031884
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . " Elizabeth was distressed . 4.641588833612778
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas . 1.6681005372000588
<UNK> you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters . 1.8632463119315603
Bennet one communication would , therefore , do for all . 8.11130830789687
Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . 2.1017480113324885
What will you think of my vanity ? 17.78279410038923
Mr . Darcy was <UNK> him with <UNK> wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . 2.1017480113324885
I thought we never should have got into the coach . 8.11130830789687
Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him . 3.593813663804627
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . 4.641588833612778
We dressed up <UNK> in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! 2.7213387683753076
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well . 3.8746751204561316
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . 3.359818286283782
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 2.154434690031884
That his anger could be carried to such a point of <UNK> resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem <UNK> , exceeded all that she could believe possible . 1.8047217668271702
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . 5.878016072274914
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 4.641588833612778
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 2.610157215682537
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 3.8746751204561316
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . 3.1622776601683795
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . 2.51188643150958

Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 1.6681005372000588
" I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . 1.4330125702369627

Bennet give up the point . 46.415888336127786
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 1.4873521072935114
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
Well , how pleased I am ! 26.82695795279726
Very well . 2154.4346900318833
Your <UNK> must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance . 2.1017480113324885
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane " I hope and trust they will yet be happy . 1.7301957388458942
You have delighted us long enough . 26.82695795279726
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were <UNK> your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month . " " You have only proved by this , " cried Elizabeth , " that Mr . Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . 1.2775649214671148
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . 12.915496650148839
<UNK> on Jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy ' s explanation , by <UNK> Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 1.8047217668271702
Their first subject was the <UNK> of the Rosings party . " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . 1.7534865500829584
He still loves me , and we are engaged . " Jane looked at her <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
How odious I should think them ! " " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " " I am afraid you do not like your pen . 1.425102670302998
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . 2.154434690031884
She turned from sister to sister , <UNK> their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . 1.53174046370208
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months . 1.615598098439874
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 2.1017480113324885
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . 10.000000000000002
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . 5.179474679231212
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <UNK> them . 5.179474679231212
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative . 2.2122162910704493
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . 2.2758459260747883
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . 3.593813663804627
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 2.4244620170823286
But I must tell you how it went off . 10.000000000000002
" You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . 1.6496480740980204
It <UNK> me . 316.22776601683796
Heaven forbid ! 2154.4346900318833

Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs . 5.878016072274914
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . 3.8746751204561316
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so <UNK> to you . 1.4873521072935114
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great <UNK> . 5.179474679231212
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
We must not all expect Jane ' s good fortune . " " True , " said Mr . Bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may <UNK> you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . " Mr . Wickham ' s society was of material service in <UNK> the gloom , which the late <UNK> occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family . 1.319720393061375
Adieu to disappointment and <UNK> . 46.415888336127786
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley is not he ? 4.641588833612778
She had also to <UNK> how her visit would pass , the quiet <UNK> of their usual employments , the vexatious <UNK> of Mr . Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings . 1.8957356524063758
If your feelings are still what they were last <UNK> , tell me so at once . 3.8746751204561316
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley . 3.593813663804627
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . 5.179474679231212
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very <UNK> in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . 1.4977474763452014

<UNK> as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> . 1.6496480740980204
Elizabeth , <UNK> all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . 1.4330125702369627
London Printed for T . 100.00000000000004
Every <UNK> <UNK> in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther <UNK> of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago <UNK> his <UNK> in the affair ; that proud and <UNK> as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had <UNK> brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be <UNK> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <UNK> or <UNK> habits . 1.2352165993694857
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? 5.878016072274914
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . 2.0535250264571463
Teaze him laugh at him . <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . " " But upon my honour I do not . 2.1017480113324885
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . 2.51188643150958
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . 3.1622776601683795
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! 3.8746751204561316
She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . 1.9684194472866121
" This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! 2.610157215682537
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last <UNK> , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were <UNK> answered . 1.8957356524063758
I have a high respect for your nerves . 12.915496650148839
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . 1.615598098439874
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . " However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather <UNK> , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . 1.5199110829529336
She saw herself the object of attention , to <UNK> and to <UNK> of them at present unknown . 3.359818286283782
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . " " Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> . 1.5848931924611136
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas ' s last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the <UNK> were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three <UNK> <UNK> at least . 1.6496480740980204
I am sure I <UNK> ' <UNK> get a wink of sleep all night . 4.641588833612778
It was in the <UNK> and the <UNK> , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . 2.610157215682537
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 2.2758459260747883
Miss Bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . 5.179474679231212

She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 1.7082763938087104
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . 1.7534865500829584
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . 2.610157215682537
The vague and unsettled suspicions which <UNK> had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 1.3894954943731377

His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy .

You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . " Elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . 2.610157215682537
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . 1.9684194472866121
Her own thoughts were <UNK> her . 26.82695795279726
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . " " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . " " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " I am not . " Lady Catherine seemed pleased . 1.2710617996147449
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . 2.346228848142263
Bingley was the principal <UNK> , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 5.878016072274914
" What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . 4.641588833612778
Good bye . " She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she <UNK> about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . 2.154434690031884
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . 2.7213387683753076
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it . 2.51188643150958

Bennet very dull for several days . 26.82695795279726
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . 4.641588833612778
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or <UNK> reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . 1.319720393061375
yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . 3.1622776601683795
Poor Charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . 1.7082763938087104
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 1.7534865500829584
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 1.9684194472866121
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 1.778279410038923
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 1.5848931924611136
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were <UNK> in her favour . 1.4497406703726319

Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give <UNK> confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr .

It originated in Mrs . 100.00000000000004
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . 4.641588833612778
At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! 1.5706464294715548
Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody ' s reserve , can be answerable for the event . 2.2758459260747883
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room . 1.4497406703726319
I am very , very sorry . 26.82695795279726
no it is not for me to be driven away by Mr . Darcy . 4.641588833612778
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 3.1622776601683795
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit . 1.778279410038923
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 6.812920690579612

" You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . 5.878016072274914
But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came . 2.8480358684358014
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 4.641588833612778
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <UNK> him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 1.6496480740980204
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age . 2.0092330025650473
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united <UNK> . 2.346228848142263
Her ladyship was highly incensed . 46.415888336127786
I thought it my duty to give the <UNK> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well <UNK> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . 1.2775649214671148
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . 1.7082763938087104
CHAPTER XI . 2154.4346900318833
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent <UNK> of <UNK> on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . 1.6496480740980204
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . 1.7301957388458942
<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 46.415888336127786
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . 3.593813663804627
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . 1.3768571648527583
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas . 12.915496650148839
CHAPTER XV . 2154.4346900318833
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . 2.4244620170823286
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 1.778279410038923
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 1.6876124757881477
Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . 6.812920690579612
My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his <UNK> in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . 1.3768571648527583
The t te t te surprised them . 17.78279410038923
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . 2.0092330025650473
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <UNK> . 5.179474679231212
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some <UNK> , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . " When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister . 1.1844845812380058
" Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss Bingley ; " and pray what is the result ? " " I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect . 1.7301957388458942
She has a very good notion of <UNK> , though her taste is not equal to Anne ' s . 3.1622776601683795
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . " " You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . 1.4677992676220695
" While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr . Bingley . " " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife . 1.8957356524063758
It was the last of the regiment ' s stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were <UNK> <UNK> . 2.51188643150958
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford . 17.78279410038923
If his own vanity , however , did not <UNK> him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . 1.8632463119315603
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . 3.8746751204561316
Oh ! 100000.00000000001
" There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London . 1.6681005372000588
Section . 100000.00000000001
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 1.4585940117250362
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! 8.11130830789687
I could hardly keep my countenance . 26.82695795279726
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <UNK> , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her <UNK> and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , Lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . 1.4497406703726319
How is half such a sum to be repaid ? " Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . 1.93069772888325
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of <UNK> , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 1.557068404753731
I told Mrs . 316.22776601683796
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <UNK> manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . 2.1017480113324885
how can it affect them ? " " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! 2.346228848142263
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . 6.812920690579612
It is of all subjects my delight . 17.78279410038923
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 2.1017480113324885
Such were the gentle <UNK> of Mrs . 17.78279410038923
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . 1.8632463119315603
Their reception at home was most kind . 17.78279410038923
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it . 2.610157215682537
What shall we do with him ? 26.82695795279726
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . 6.812920690579612
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us . 5.878016072274914
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the <UNK> , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 1.41011239906908

Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 2.154434690031884
has she any family ? " " She has one only daughter , the <UNK> of Rosings , and of very extensive property . " " Ah ! " cried Mrs . 2.0535250264571463
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and <UNK> . 1.8957356524063758
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . 1.338388753173757
So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 2.51188643150958

Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . 3.1622776601683795
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his <UNK> were at the same time so vague and <UNK> , that her mother , though often <UNK> , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . 1.6876124757881477

I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . 2.9935772947204895
Elizabeth did all she could , to <UNK> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 1.2478254704700218

You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . 3.1622776601683795
Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1.4873521072935114
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . 5.179474679231212
The adieu is <UNK> itself . 46.415888336127786
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . 2.154434690031884
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 17.78279410038923
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that <UNK> is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . 1.353876180022544
No sentiment of shame gave a <UNK> to her triumph . 8.11130830789687
I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . 1.425102670302998
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . 10.000000000000002
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . " " And I certainly never shall give it . 2.4244620170823286
And now here ' s Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 1.778279410038923
But though every thing seemed <UNK> and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <UNK> ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . 1.6876124757881477
That such a consequence as this should <UNK> , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . " " When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . " " Not the slightest . 1.5441135899948315
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . " " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . 1.7534865500829584
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet , " that is very unlucky . " " Can I have the carriage ? " said Jane . 3.1622776601683795
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . " " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . 1.2679227183627855
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . 2.346228848142263
Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . 3.359818286283782
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had <UNK> time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 1.4773776525985112
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . 3.8746751204561316
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . 1.5848931924611136
Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day . 1.7534865500829584
As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . 1.778279410038923
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening . 2.0535250264571463
Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . 1.4773776525985112
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done . 2.154434690031884
Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 3.8746751204561316
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . 4.216965034285822
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 1.6876124757881477
What is to become of us ! 26.82695795279726
Poor Lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . 2.2758459260747883
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 2.8480358684358014
But she is nothing to me now . 17.78279410038923
" <UNK> <UNK> . " CHAPTER XIII . 17.78279410038923
Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , <UNK> exclaimed , " Good Lord ! 2.1017480113324885
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . 1.6496480740980204
If this be the case , he deserves you . 10.000000000000002
Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . 2.1017480113324885
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 1.3708385261355818
" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . 12.915496650148839

" Wickham so very bad ! 46.415888336127786
" How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . You think it a faithful <UNK> undoubtedly . " " I must not decide on my own performance . " He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . 1.3894954943731377
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did . 8.11130830789687
Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your <UNK> appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . " " Oh ! 1.353876180022544
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week . 1.6876124757881477
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 2.2758459260747883
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . 3.1622776601683795
" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 2.1017480113324885
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of <UNK> for them . 2.346228848142263
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 1.8329807108324359
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . 4.641588833612778
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . 6.812920690579612
I must have employment and society . 26.82695795279726
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . " " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . " " Pride , " observed Mary , who <UNK> herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe . 1.396135390856794
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! 3.8746751204561316
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 4.641588833612778
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such <UNK> , and her intreaty that she would not give into it . 2.346228848142263
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . " " Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . 1.5998587196060583
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . 1.5848931924611136
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . 4.216965034285822
it is of no consequence . 46.415888336127786
" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " His misfortunes ! " repeated Darcy <UNK> ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . " " And of your <UNK> , " cried Elizabeth with energy . 1.5706464294715548
" <UNK> resentment is a shade in a character . 10.000000000000002
" Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 1.365007806546014
" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? " " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . " " La ! " replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . 1.4330125702369627
Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane ' s ? 3.359818286283782
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 1.8047217668271702
Be so kind as to <UNK> for us to Miss Darcy . 6.812920690579612
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 5.878016072274914
Did you see it ? " Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . 3.8746751204561316
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his <UNK> when he speaks . 4.641588833612778
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 6.812920690579612
where is your <UNK> my dear ? " But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 2.154434690031884
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . 5.179474679231212
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence . 1.5199110829529336
" Yes , Ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as <UNK> to the poor . " Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . 1.7534865500829584
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . 1.93069772888325
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . 1.8329807108324359
Mrs . 100000.00000000001
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . 2.9935772947204895
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 3.593813663804627
" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 26.82695795279726
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . 5.179474679231212
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . 12.915496650148839
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . 2.7213387683753076
Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority . 2.1017480113324885
Jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all . 8.11130830789687
Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 2.2758459260747883
CHAPTER IX . 2154.4346900318833
Mr . Darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . 3.359818286283782
Mr . Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . 2.51188643150958
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 3.359818286283782
" I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham . 2.0535250264571463
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " " But I was embarrassed . " " And so was I . " " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " " A man who had felt less , might . " " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 1.2560585988318853
<UNK> more than half a day ' s journey . 10.000000000000002
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 1.8047217668271702
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . 6.812920690579612
Bennet was quite in the <UNK> . 26.82695795279726
" Let us sit down . 46.415888336127786
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . 6.812920690579612
Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . " After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! 1.4497406703726319
<UNK> back the servant , therefore , she <UNK> him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost <UNK> , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly . 2.0092330025650473
Any other inconsistencies with modern <UNK> have been left as printed . 6.812920690579612
It adds even another motive . 46.415888336127786
You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " " You mistake me , my dear . 3.593813663804627
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 2.8480358684358014
I enquired after their brother , of course . 12.915496650148839
Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night <UNK> and <UNK> gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty <UNK> away . " " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " " You go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds ! 1.2532543355087804
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . 1.7082763938087104
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so <UNK> ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and <UNK> , " Let me call your maid . 1.557068404753731
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr . Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . 1.5706464294715548
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? " " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . " " Oh ! 1.632172128563275
But so they always are . 46.415888336127786
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her <UNK> being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 1.3768571648527583
We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation . 2.9935772947204895
" But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy . 1.5706464294715548
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . 6.812920690579612
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . 10.000000000000002
my sweetest Lizzy ! 316.22776601683796
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 17.78279410038923
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . 2.1017480113324885
Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> . 1.778279410038923
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can ' t write ; so I will <UNK> , and you write for me . 2.0535250264571463
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! 2.2122162910704493
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh . 1.8957356524063758
He was <UNK> his memory with <UNK> and noble names . 8.11130830789687
In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . 2.2758459260747883
She blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who <UNK> their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . 2.610157215682537
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <UNK> family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . 1.778279410038923
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , c . 1.7534865500829584
Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 2.610157215682537
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . " " Oh ! 1.6876124757881477
" He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 2.0092330025650473
