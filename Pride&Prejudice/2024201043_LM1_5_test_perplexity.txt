2692.763791747037
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " " That you certainly shall . " " And I have another favour to ask . 3856.5953383749834
I will try again . 370.0313730503433
Had Elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . 3152.5061436243345
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . 1340.5334713045909
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . 5101.947514426653
Who would have thought it ! 494.2864124851351
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so <UNK> ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and <UNK> , " Let me call your maid . 4388.448248323391
<UNK> Kitty ! 158.1505806503976
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . 1613.993590244549
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months . 4232.762112987985
Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at <UNK> , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs . 2992.6625103111555
He could number the <UNK> in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <UNK> . 2637.849227205018
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the <UNK> , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <UNK> . 4054.491466644859
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <UNK> <UNK> on the probability of each statement but with little success . 3077.0437080882634
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . 2911.6845425928673
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . 1477.5351600844028
CHAPTER II . 158.33268212522805
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! 629.3955713816622
They were in street . 368.5705063988503
Any other inconsistencies with modern <UNK> have been left as printed . 1339.2020570839534
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . 2438.5366581244534
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . 2821.0061547419223
For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . 3746.050031855265
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 3375.7279286705257
I am ashamed of you ! 497.2100411036086
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband . 4350.987464146766
He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable house . 2109.538942187088
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . 2330.9843311457607
" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face . 2543.3149399256486
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . 2908.804871049802
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 4194.4547974263005
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 4566.788304545211
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . " " And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? " " The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . 5062.014800308205
<UNK> me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . " Elizabeth could not refuse , though she <UNK> little pleasure in the visit . 2820.6212706925858
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . " " In what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought Elizabeth . 3504.9181456730603
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall <UNK> a list , according to his information . 3228.367165436321
Never mind Miss Lizzy ' s hair . " " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . " " Oh ! 4351.155614172039
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some <UNK> neighbour , who could not be enough <UNK> , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 4529.246648032311
Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and <UNK> its extent . 1477.5724732361195
His character was decided . 368.23125575062323
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself . 4193.181291649561
" You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . " " I should be sorry indeed , if it were . 3695.0634138038067
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay . 2109.8642972128496
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 3228.0074564320053
This Mrs . 158.26886958698736
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . 2331.705264552905
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 1342.2928245570304
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 913.052412004828
Are the <UNK> of Pemberley to be thus <UNK> ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . 2908.038215558867
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . " " I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want . " " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " No , indeed . 4597.429528383414
Her answer , therefore , was not <UNK> , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . 2909.0364117896966
My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . 2730.5340185465698
Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . " " No , no . 1992.2449421106462
Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . 1869.6307649662128
" What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut . 2336.6193174881705
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 5528.629165110393
You refuse , then , to oblige me . 913.8506085057882
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . 3960.265013990096
You <UNK> me for coming ? " " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you . 3440.3945581306293
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . 2638.980575952766
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . 1615.4211219469262
So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 2820.5937762251415
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . 1989.3119749081673
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 2823.232912283874
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister ' s being in town . 2438.56693753145
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 2993.220716199593
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . " " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be . 5396.875628412462
You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and <UNK> all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg tm works . 3690.225676195295
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 2330.752323467114
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 3573.499145921984
This information , however , startled Mrs . 770.0084332717727
Sir William had been delighted with him . 769.854466447891
U . S . laws alone <UNK> our small <UNK> . 1198.759173026012
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 1343.8221786947688
And is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? 1477.5591486659403
A clear ten thousand per annum . 629.5653576514842
Bennet was <UNK> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and <UNK> in her <UNK> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the <UNK> happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 4996.172407058999
On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . 5284.767058068236
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . 2822.209086554305
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . 1613.1103271928262
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . 1478.5909476870409
I have no pleasure in talking to <UNK> children . Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body . 2640.8105161754124
" My dear , dear aunt , " she <UNK> cried , " what delight ! 1872.447919173917
. F . . Some states do not allow <UNK> of certain implied <UNK> or the exclusion or limitation of certain <UNK> of damages . 2820.7313744362737
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . 1741.822119833971
But she is perfectly amiable , and often <UNK> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . " " Has she been presented ? 3155.2035366054993
You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " " You mistake me , my dear . 2109.25945173904
Now is your time . 367.8390420537478
They all <UNK> tables , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> . 1199.9283788907744
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . 3570.2861570965083
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 1867.1903776699187
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months . 4717.362028172394
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . 1478.0949380044483
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon <UNK> up every private care ; and covering her face with her <UNK> , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . 5631.446237100784
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . 4233.937211860136
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 2441.6706253481548
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its <UNK> . 2436.2473858011936
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as , by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . 4657.873883187419
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and <UNK> forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . 2732.9310811268138
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . 2108.1956247135317
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . 1745.9802992967238
Bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at <UNK> , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to <UNK> you when your father is dead . I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . 5866.3674595413
Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . 1741.9141551931912
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 2109.522020410724
Its <UNK> depended on others . 494.19534789624095
A most delightful place ! <UNK> Parsonage House ! 913.0024464072483
He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia . 1200.8627562662475
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . 1339.285108118253
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . 1741.9000892740332
CHAPTER <UNK> . 158.31344539901033
Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night <UNK> and <UNK> gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty <UNK> away . " " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " " You go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds ! 5490.452791460715
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . " " But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . " " Let me be rightly understood . 4500.442211004533
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . 3152.841798274015
" Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? 2735.1411913212046
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 3076.378015089888
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . " " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! 3908.004171114361
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . " " If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . 4716.2012087819
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . " " That is his notion of christian forgiveness ! 3856.97183347026
I am glad he is gone . 632.8197914654073
Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . 4625.711850080565
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . 3751.651021654041
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . 3752.244731541228
So near a <UNK> to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart . 2729.653215125222
What do I not owe you ! 629.6057660545334
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . " CHAPTER VII . 3153.071975399566
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been <UNK> by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 3801.668611757685
" When my eyes were opened to his real character . Oh ! 1481.4335120876262
On this subject , what can you have to say ? 1199.1324775869593
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 2733.2928585124696
She is gone down to her uncle at <UNK> ; gone to stay . 1614.1861047440607
When they were all in the drawing room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . 3689.443213463655
But still he would be her husband . Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . 4497.762509166555
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his <UNK> were at the same time so vague and <UNK> , that her mother , though often <UNK> , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . 4055.5833700890275
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and <UNK> pass away . 3568.0060586095715
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 2224.2328020463965
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 4798.701871511946
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an <UNK> of Mr . Darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . 3750.2758480498596
CHAPTER III . 158.33268212522805
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 913.3199917429986
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . 1200.2909448392325
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North . 3301.4210323925395
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . 1989.392425994373
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . 1741.8611004344662
" How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet ! 1615.7827859819608
" What will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are ! 2226.0119480661683
Mr . Collins made his declaration in form . 915.2174614679813
We seem to have been designed for each other . " Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she <UNK> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . 4054.8858309517927
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . 2908.9016281621534
With many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs . 3746.125639928012
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 5196.864485407398
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . 2638.9805504356077
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 5350.999574902626
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! 1056.2597097932407
It was the last of the regiment ' s stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were <UNK> <UNK> . 2824.088788929113
No , no I feel he may defy us there . 1199.08746386781
Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s sufferings . 3156.490475842843
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . 2732.850825663918
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " <UNK> so I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . 5334.290307209939
Lady Catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . 2221.327739459096
Bennet one communication would , therefore , do for all . 1200.5095444169076
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left <UNK> , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . 5622.524262781047
" How <UNK> have I acted ! " she cried . " I , who have <UNK> myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! 3375.959626213496
" I cannot make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by <UNK> for being next in the entail ? We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " No , my dear ; I think not . 4720.106954101259
Lydia , my love , ring the bell . 912.9332921623339
It is of all subjects my delight . 771.7627593173833
<UNK> would like to go too of all things ! 1056.2062306174107
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . " " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . 3907.9060733567476
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge . 3504.8529135619897
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 2221.6254635578707
Elizabeth merely <UNK> to him , without saying a word . 1200.0529500981356
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 2330.5055636381176
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs . 2730.5748588209517
" It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . 4355.987057884631
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 5409.456660057212
Kitty <UNK> and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . 1476.7747398701658
" I see what you are feeling , " replied Charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to marry you . 3510.511457952116
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 1058.0941615721547
How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? " " That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . 3439.4173102411787
Her report was highly favourable . 494.7044214679616
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 2823.0286527345133
Their table was <UNK> stupid . 494.36316504429476
is she handsome ? " " She is a most charming young lady indeed . 1741.0856932870101
London Printed for T . 367.8332608041528
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . 4530.845776645895
CHAPTER II . 158.33268212522805
" I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . " " Perhaps I do . 3306.6224512775975
How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . 2993.3180667202987
Her own thoughts were <UNK> her . 629.863209521124
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . " " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . 4357.447758500578
" She is so fond of Mrs . 773.2151304143594
Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the <UNK> . 2221.558178903131
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 1741.68218067517
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 1201.7559043018323
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . 1200.1656286373006
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before . 3228.249400437847
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . 2331.108202915437
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <UNK> of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James ' s , with very decent composure . 4056.666121885486
His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . 3228.4476738390413
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 4566.057449462855
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 2992.375860932227
I knew you would be wishing me joy . " " Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . 3232.55070439118
You are lucky in having such a master . " " Yes , Sir , I know I am . 2332.530495977858
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . 1867.547549035045
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 2107.424749249349
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . 4597.070725547545
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . 2635.985425580022
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . 4147.869984942318
" You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . 1203.3638773028847
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . 3692.293782035259
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . 3568.7569702611254
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . 4010.4119032008116
She will be down in a moment I dare say . " He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 3507.943428793661
Poor little Lizzy ! 254.27907262783975
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . 3634.6496232422073
Mr . Bennet accepted the <UNK> , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . 2638.5232224563983
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? " " I think she will . 3376.3845418797173
Well , how pleased I am ! 629.5494788086439
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 3152.975833712301
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . 1742.6468242791454
" Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 3634.1480685580045
dear me ! 158.1665955100683
But I have other <UNK> . 496.0692464961673
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 1867.6127329696228
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 2439.3915237164883
" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . " " You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! If my vanity had taken a <UNK> turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <UNK> . " On Miss Lucas ' s <UNK> , however , she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . " And gravely glancing at Mr . Darcy , " There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with ' <UNK> your breath to cool your <UNK> , ' and I shall keep mine to <UNK> my song . " Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . 6062.816110873079
" And this is always the way with him , " she added . " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . 3376.3183200022127
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . 2823.483152960279
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 5579.632054278636
CHAPTER XII . 158.33268212522805
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and <UNK> . 3629.964193981322
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <UNK> . 3909.262717557442
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . 4272.177837274053
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . 3228.4754369906286
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " CHAPTER <UNK> . 4054.991694091106
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have <UNK> either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . 4189.018418233369
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 1612.2283664000638
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been <UNK> , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . 3859.833953523643
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . 1344.0716900545683
and so extremely accomplished for her age ! 769.818077938509
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <UNK> , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 4773.872806039549
" But so we all do . 632.4911266419599
" You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . 1482.0873907111725
What could your ladyship propose by it ? " " At once to insist upon having such a report universally <UNK> . " " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . " " If ! 4826.227996222622
She is not such a simpleton . 631.533851371806
In a <UNK> voice Mrs . 494.69772161642766
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 5449.504663222153
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . 4231.5905883898395
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were <UNK> your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month . " " You have only proved by this , " cried Elizabeth , " that Mr . Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . 5378.859202697282
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the <UNK> on guard , and dressing a <UNK> and <UNK> . 3438.7200110262006
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . " " I am , " said he , with a firm voice . 3077.86219474353
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . 1476.7378541593441
<UNK> of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . " Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready <UNK> . 3958.074413210439
<UNK> that may be , you are <UNK> to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs . 2635.1842857033803
The <UNK> would be spoilt by <UNK> a fourth . 1058.6178853043616
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . 3629.6973090987512
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so doubtful , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea . 4878.250586249018
Elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . 2637.026948696687
She was humbled , she was grieved ; she <UNK> , though she hardly knew of what . 2110.9874795568403
It was really a very handsome thought . 772.0068381405921
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W . 2820.5110834935576
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <UNK> . 2730.588001655284
Gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , <UNK> of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 5317.031324101991
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . " " Oh ! 2735.604574598641
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 1994.25024917236
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 3505.385817595553
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was <UNK> for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . 5016.770460343902
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . 2993.207003933561
Believe her to be deceived by all means . 912.7145312872361
But that is not the case here . 771.8857178845008
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 2220.7673644794704
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united <UNK> . 2992.6080626788007
The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 4147.834713246684
There ' s for you ! 494.5375779663952
The Foundation ' s principal office is located at <UNK> Dr . S . 1613.6785844157412
She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . 3858.8867245711767
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . " <UNK> ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 3373.3524748491286
How much sooner one <UNK> of any thing than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . " No one made any reply . 3907.6355124945176
This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham . 4145.667561252998
As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it <UNK> and lovely as ever . 4461.013161778548
How are they even to be discovered ? 769.98130764279
that he had <UNK> his <UNK> in the first dance ! " " Oh ! 1741.3447084997724
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 2336.262636307237
They are gone off together from Brighton . 770.7840991754998
The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs . 1058.7250890705943
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a <UNK> , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . " " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . 5439.468070347237
He has children of his own , and may have more . 1341.5951817527903
If I were not afraid of judging <UNK> , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . 3152.882480990642
But really , Ma ' am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . 4688.7074512419695
Lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 3746.087845488481
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party . 1478.7018181010658
I will read you the passage which particularly <UNK> me . 1203.1204266903817
By Mrs . 158.1954002116691
CHAPTER X . 158.33268212522805
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 158.16979894891088
but from what the report of their engagement could <UNK> , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . 4771.472686322904
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 4009.518584938005
yes ; there is nothing in that . 769.7635833273945
The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion . 1341.9486062178214
Mr . Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . 1614.0328385316518
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . " Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative . 4354.682892380351
" What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . 1746.0382092436905
Elizabeth silently attended her . 368.4429162376445
We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . 4529.588136373668
Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , <UNK> him I believe very early in life . 3746.214084459994
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 1744.0766446570733
It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . 2994.8361686984854
Mr . Collins received and returned these <UNK> with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <UNK> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 4746.173612848761
It is impossible for me to be impartial . 915.0121318634503
" To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . 2112.0578597009153
See paragraph . C below . 494.2163744472452
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . 4055.1475188176414
<UNK> such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 2330.1759477408646
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . 3439.678354677119
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such <UNK> sisters , home could not be <UNK> , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake . 3629.888772467772
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever . 1339.581486719589
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . 2223.116379469555
Elizabeth took up some <UNK> , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . 2437.1630126677737
He leaves out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <UNK> . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must <UNK> reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility . 5103.75740766314
" Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our <UNK> way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . " Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and <UNK> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 4904.759011294173
" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! 4662.022153095688
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . 1477.0207928974862
I was ready to die of laughter . 773.2109767117785
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a <UNK> of emotion they excited . 2995.470668669937
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 5363.915112482444
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . 1612.291818329687
" Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . 1872.487752328312
This is your <UNK> resolve ! 494.44704775412634
<UNK> back the servant , therefore , she <UNK> him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost <UNK> , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly . 3438.6146235190868
Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . " Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . 4007.7735037402595
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . 1990.8042327291269
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious <UNK> , denoted a recollection of Jane , not <UNK> by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . 4529.41750715871
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . 3747.4364822690586
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> . 3300.6628229709163
" This will not do , " said Elizabeth . 1060.8324204944706
<UNK> back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write <UNK> . 1989.09728947122
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " Ah ! 3632.673180535827
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . 2330.5197757716446
Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her . 1341.900383176839
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair . 3910.395204139062
Our poor mother is sadly grieved . 629.3388280648762
He was angry . 255.23362683628335
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . 1872.1370942979113
" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . 1616.6184055081628
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , <UNK> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . 4460.893664198762
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . 1743.9230473409887
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage . 3855.393088239781
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . 2635.6955595288396
She <UNK> the days that must <UNK> before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . 2333.5806072738364
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane . 3374.541415816021
I had no notion but he would go a <UNK> , or something or other , and not <UNK> us with his company . 2734.6783099044196
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . 1990.64409864496
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <UNK> to that evening , " said Elizabeth . 3157.7002396187
It was gratitude . <UNK> , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <UNK> and <UNK> of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 4103.223705533423
I write without any intention of <UNK> you , or <UNK> myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the <UNK> , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . 4802.13679212328
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . 1198.9177656068136
Nothing could be more delightful ! 494.2583885359537
If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 2730.6308976584646
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago . " " I have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said Mrs . 3444.173113682467
You must and shall be married by a special licence . 1200.2562544382124
You thought me then <UNK> of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . 1868.9915202365714
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . 1342.1008672878847
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn house . 1339.3443160772094
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . 1990.8176539162887
I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . " Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . 4429.328845614123
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . 1867.955708420512
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook , complying with the rules is very easy . 2331.204681704936
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . 3439.298829347483
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 4231.475809678865
<UNK> recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be <UNK> . 1740.8908691943113
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 1744.323697695577
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 1613.828619217399
A little time therefore . I shall certainly try to get the better . " With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . " " My dear Jane ! " exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good . 5017.517145956129
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> . 4147.57847732286
You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs . 1200.2789384467999
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <UNK> by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . 4312.791582649515
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being <UNK> dressed . 1611.2238927543806
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 4193.140479645481
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . 5059.732879295157
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 3912.8882910152124
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . 2537.8064337124156
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 3504.644640766773
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . 4102.644338500825
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . " CHAPTER VI . 4193.402903908557
" I am , dear Sir , c . 917.3677296617279
But our visitor was very obstinate . 631.2073908283422
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . 4188.461078130257
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . 1992.7256514286444
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 3504.357137695485
my dear , " continued Mrs . 629.5820467689091
Mr . Collins was carefully <UNK> them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <UNK> them . 3632.453647709095
<UNK> Michael S . 254.23402745560935
Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 2909.0261761843904
Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . 1870.5565046368465
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . 4350.976329244459
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . 2820.8966837873236
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . 4974.485630509932
Collins well . " " Yes , very well . 1057.1569810827712
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 2331.0935821437024
" But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . " " <UNK> , headstrong girl ! 3962.940387719422
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia ' s marriage . 2110.198699931166
They had long wished to see him . 770.7931927392104
Consider Mr . Collins ' s respectability , and Charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . 1989.6203702390267
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 1478.7018181010658
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . 494.23737707393224
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . 1990.978789346519
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . " " I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your <UNK> what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . 3960.860830676328
" <UNK> resentment is a shade in a character . 1060.253561837222
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . 2330.711989135357
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one <UNK> in it an object of compassion , while they are <UNK> of our intimacy at Rosings . " <UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> . 5038.935975593214
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented . 2107.045783686965
GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . 3301.0236409280405
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 4233.086891640607
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . 1867.3753618809815
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Mr . Robinson . " " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? 4529.695340234377
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . 2330.71166517537
Elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 4146.504837242345
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 5061.86758241138
In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . 3074.652164625028
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . 3157.320985308582
This was very amiable , but Charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . 4146.031354440782
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the <UNK> property of some one or other of their daughters . 4350.338296241235
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s . 3228.4210126143066
" If they had uncles enough to <UNK> all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one <UNK> less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . 4316.450183916988
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 2992.962055128289
And one of my own daughters . 629.8473782285186
Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces . 2436.013972548155
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . " Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . 3504.474799555624
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . 3441.1518994629114
where is your <UNK> my dear ? " But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 3227.6177838662793
When the ladies were <UNK> for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> . 3153.044861052096

Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . " " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . 5887.604486773873
Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . 4994.6884258894215
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can ' t write ; so I will <UNK> , and you write for me . 3372.0402106374204
And it is the more to be <UNK> , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte <UNK> me , that this <UNK> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs . 4529.949586408373
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general . 1867.0845214914707
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 3691.822527441439
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged <UNK> of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . 4189.23718753199
You must therefore allow me to follow the <UNK> of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . 3302.0814792630267
Long and the Gouldings soon . 494.3003596028635
The Foundation is <UNK> to complying with the laws <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> donations in all states of the United States . 2540.468518090383
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been <UNK> , and it had actually been <UNK> that Colonel Forster was going to be married . 4311.493976758035
Kitty and Lydia take his <UNK> much more to heart than I do . 1610.8312657957115
" It certainly is a most <UNK> affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . 3233.660696694665
She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . Mr . Darcy said very little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all . 4192.316737502611
My mind was more agreeably engaged . 629.8071668182307
On entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . 4529.4282339688625
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 3957.9405433235524
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . 1867.5730466867544
They had frequently been staying with her in town . 1057.5240943661524
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia . 3300.7166451944317
Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon <UNK> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 3439.324950170745
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some <UNK> , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . " When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister . 5834.653146622001
The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who <UNK> it , were familiar to them . 2823.5630694534007
There was no want of discourse . 629.8484944026326
Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in <UNK> . 3152.046390755748
" How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . You think it a faithful <UNK> undoubtedly . " " I must not decide on my own performance . " He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . 4929.841493971759
The vague and unsettled suspicions which <UNK> had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 4927.737796301999
He has not an ill natured look . 771.4888420577922
When you told Mrs . 368.1620941243502
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees . 3441.7284064433984
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 5017.6063324906345
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <UNK> of elegant nuptials , fine <UNK> , new carriages , and servants . 4427.269697071551
They will ruin your happiness . 494.98871027374076
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . 4388.436887508588
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . 1477.1928099110598

Mrs . 84.28665600062531
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs . 4771.8002962976525
He has the promise of an <UNK> in General ' s regiment , now quartered in the North . 2223.2258990775113
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 3152.8304137999653
CHAPTER XI . 158.33268212522805
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . 2636.206810165278
Jane was not happy . 368.04147598212506
But , alas ! 255.3945688910086
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . 2220.9584086404475
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had <UNK> to his amusement . 2537.8197193249975
This was agreed to , and Mrs . 770.1266407107075
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . 5351.745017159081
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
She is quite a little creature . 631.533851371806
Your ' s , c . " Mr . Darcy ' s letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last . 4147.287415572255
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 1989.7273808637503
" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . 1482.2570642033481
Bennet ' s <UNK> looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . 2109.2243214696346
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . " " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 4498.496876400672
We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 2436.3028656897486
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 3749.265446414244
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . 2436.2761082835
Do not let us quarrel about the past . 912.8736839977157
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . 5317.031005182422
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? 1198.8044977316074
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 3154.8269940867212
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 1479.612815608219
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <UNK> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . 3077.234514518786
If there were but such another man for you ! " " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . 3301.3951147711664
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and <UNK> way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to morrow evening . 4145.913664466753
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . 1342.8383131972948
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " Darcy mentioned his letter . 2441.06514281089
has she any family ? " " She has one only daughter , the <UNK> of Rosings , and of very extensive property . " " Ah ! " cried Mrs . 3370.8758452911325
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . 2330.984451092136
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . 4687.638010318585
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . 2731.244793229114
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 5123.360812189798
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 1744.5207440753165
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , <UNK> painful to me . 3691.325464396632
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother . 1615.5228343172964
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . 4190.753943514828
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . 3958.6194851660425
I will speak to her about it myself directly . 1060.3560745075515
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . 3691.747751177886
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very <UNK> <UNK> for Netherfield were got by <UNK> . 2729.7772799319796
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 1198.90640512948
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? 1198.8951041145106
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 1611.248919876501
It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed <UNK> ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among <UNK> woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its <UNK> parts . 3959.8526242811745
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . 2107.8705794442235
It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . " " Oh ! 3572.267553199648
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . 3959.6777250108876
She now lost every expectation of pleasure . 772.0602735547817
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . 3152.3840869418395
But she is nothing to me now . 771.9312840182994
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his <UNK> when he speaks . 1741.3967289830177
Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . 915.0681741561683
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . 5060.827872170815
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them . 1479.5758100732264
Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . " " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . 4193.448979072196
. 34.63748678533662
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 5039.207643168147
But don ' t imagine it was from any silly cause . 1342.0057654492362
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . 1745.798219611
She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent . 4353.750152427768
Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . 2635.765108868569
My feelings in every respect forbid it . 770.2886750468273
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! " cried Elizabeth when she had finished it . 1610.8566569821332
" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . " " I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice . 4777.590304402735
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . 2221.1499467552408
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away . 2436.7696914058815
What are you telling Miss Bennet ? 629.6138784854971
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 5504.1065570489
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? 3747.3796842149113
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 4746.615077835025
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . 2540.952644330428
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . 2909.5385894151104
Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <UNK> at whist , enumerating all the <UNK> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he <UNK> his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . 4271.892952757318
Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment . 915.0083688239466
But you have chosen your fault well . I really cannot laugh at it . 1744.0506281246571
intending to trace their route . 494.19535782522115
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . " He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 5551.967885137016
Mary was obliged to <UNK> more with the world , but she could still <UNK> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <UNK> between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <UNK> to the change without much <UNK> . 4460.491158420327
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <UNK> , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the <UNK> way for happiness . 4994.880924019437
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 3227.7789535034244
Four nieces of Mrs . 367.8216714904913
<UNK> are settled so <UNK> . " " You <UNK> perhaps to the entail of this estate . " " Ah ! 2537.80557076525
We will go round the Park every day . 913.1215703957448
It was not all settled before Monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . 2439.322407382057
I told my sister Philips so the other day . 1060.2166886624996
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . 3152.0599171775666
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 4594.997384666953
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . " " Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly . 3571.6462794730633
Gardiner , rendered <UNK> by Elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . 2107.8709257125547
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . 5041.300073904004
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 1056.2704032244876
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? 1199.5946238076688
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . 4657.756197996636
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . " Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . 4101.26058540108
That he was surprised by the <UNK> was evident ; he <UNK> it however with <UNK> , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner . 3746.138152867169
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! 2221.095768721341
The supposition did not pain her . 631.1601642056075
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 2908.9821268454484
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <UNK> in so small a family as her ' s , and <UNK> her as to the care of her <UNK> and her poultry . 4717.956525600578
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . 5039.262042859516
After a slight <UNK> for good news , the letter was read aloud . 1611.1729493395223
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 1995.0545816354543
Elizabeth did all she could , to <UNK> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 5515.700477093051
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first <UNK> his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . 3689.378166923491
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to <UNK> the fruits of her own <UNK> offence . 4007.133580635388
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <UNK> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . 4529.884999025777
" Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated . 1615.592045337302
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . 4715.421862958468
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . 2439.4053534758623
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 2223.863659595239
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . " " Indeed ! " " Yes the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> . 4903.392603631186
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <UNK> her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 4272.792785869195
" While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . 3306.891797963569
" If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs . 1481.5446323771555
He is come Mr . Bingley is come . He is , indeed . 1613.2626943057567
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 629.8875639829727
You know I have . 368.52957186039436
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater <UNK> concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being <UNK> by <UNK> , <UNK> inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . 4006.6384642817457
The first week of their return was soon gone . 1058.7465214034821
<UNK> <UNK> the face of Mrs . 629.2577381448499
" But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not <UNK> his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . 3860.6470506515866
The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 4057.1540741906997
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her . 3154.46459250619
This son was to join in <UNK> off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . 3505.087954291472
" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . 3694.6094857919697
<UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill . 912.6747171360256
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . 4744.384039802221
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! 3746.728932066765
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe . 3801.76929342921
Nobody wants him to come . 494.20236326659005
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for <UNK> him also with Lizzy . 2822.612875177618
Their powers of conversation were considerable . 629.5168841779788
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . 2435.8071118151543
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . 4352.898284739043
But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . " " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " Yes . 3960.869395429627
He owns it himself without disguise . " " No " said Darcy , " I have made no such pretension . 2540.541186355354
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 1610.7932579391145
Such was Miss Lucas ' s scheme ; and <UNK> were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . 3855.4181828198516
" Good gracious ! 256.0003073026137
<UNK> , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . 4230.819855214444
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 1613.7269667201958
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many <UNK> of that nature . 4145.747755758955
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . 1477.6201473617598
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <UNK> at the <UNK> of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time <UNK> her natural degree of sense , since the <UNK> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be <UNK> , was likely to be <UNK> in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a <UNK> place and a camp . 5489.35736010463
Let Wickham be your man . 494.3213192419087
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 4851.925071803023
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern . 1199.1775668268747
<UNK> you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters . 3688.426332637772
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . " The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . 3691.3295487121272
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 4657.318995579261
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . 1339.2613890537607
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . 3227.8593923972985
Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s <UNK> , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any <UNK> of sentiment . If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error . 5016.95241645062
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . 1199.61626744982
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 1203.0800915452432
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general <UNK> to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . 4188.600754999321
<UNK> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 2909.3893457361864
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may <UNK> to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund . 2732.767808651679
Oh , no . " " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . " " No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . " " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . " She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . 5081.71265959298
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 2220.8632008807367
<UNK> to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . 3745.873173978999
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 2732.2763157718355
What say you , Mary ? 494.4539658674431
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . 3803.646418071954
Philips were now <UNK> of the most interesting intelligence . 1056.4091840144379
How odious I should think them ! " " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " " I am afraid you do not like your pen . 4801.5566408331415
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their <UNK> , <UNK> , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty ' s and Lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it . 4529.662815900417
Lydia was Lydia still ; <UNK> , <UNK> , wild , noisy , and <UNK> . 1867.269497013615
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States . 2107.0594120556475
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare <UNK> to listen to . 3747.1017248738417
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . 2221.0673103821555
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . 1342.3522799739412
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley ' s <UNK> on fine eyes . 4852.895900369713
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? " " Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . 3228.515205372645
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 4656.784397245651
You alluded to something else . 494.9951846314517
" I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ' s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . 3695.1691989729516
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . 2331.067163225409
The journey would moreover give her a <UNK> at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . 3374.013082193774
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uncle Philips , <UNK> <UNK> wine , who followed them into the room . 4927.379417788166
Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to <UNK> it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . 3504.6967134705687
Your ' s , very sincerely , " <UNK> . 1056.5801362552595
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over <UNK> evils , or <UNK> them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . 3155.935559799773

In spite of her deeply <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger . 4799.437979302458
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 770.7022039510969
After <UNK> their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ? 3300.7024137188173
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . 1613.6531811616796
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <UNK> of Mrs . 2333.223010184707
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . <UNK> staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . 5664.032005451241
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling <UNK> on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give . 5478.238280597468
But he is an ugly fellow ! 631.2643198949762
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 4852.955440726238
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s . 1992.7436408240799
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . 4146.70447148495
" Yes , Ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as <UNK> to the poor . " Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . 3912.177691330896
<UNK> has she condescended to give me her opinion <UNK> too ! on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our <UNK> at quadrille , while Mrs . 3688.4135314990904
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world . 2537.668516688194
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 2911.242430236649
But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . 1342.6591353131412
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time . 3629.389261279304
I am not at all afraid of her dying . 1060.9547464373218
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 1741.1763664665125
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . 1056.3879381797824
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . 915.008945903465
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and <UNK> to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head . 3374.2249919293786
I hope we may often meet again . " Elizabeth smiled . 1343.6503666299836
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . 1341.4288690419335
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . 2994.915554027343
Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their <UNK> in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . 4994.780185387598
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern <UNK> , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . 5642.82213201723
" Oh ! 159.45205162549917
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 4352.988030362815
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . 1615.8717670180527
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit . 3856.650115733003
Bennet . 84.29501402535595
" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . " Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . 4499.5638411357595
It <UNK> me . 255.044967688282
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity . 4716.309367124748
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <UNK> them . 1610.9832777096303
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . 2537.6269224690363
" When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! I who knew what he was . 3305.8904000614384
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ' s visit . 4054.4559941545003
<UNK> was the least of her feelings on this developement . 1198.7478477380632
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . " She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . " Again his astonishment was <UNK> ; and he looked at her with an expression of <UNK> incredulity and mortification . 5987.190792263227
I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 3634.3219427942745
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 5451.196990353604
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went <UNK> against the <UNK> ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <UNK> <UNK> , and give the praise where it was due . 5142.338600449675
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . 3371.734478681334
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of <UNK> the mind of his wife . 4903.248001765868
Mr . Collins ' s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . 2110.8656265043755
Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody ' s reserve , can be answerable for the event . 3073.662428116244
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . " " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . 4598.39622485005
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . 770.7111683669365
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater <UNK> than first <UNK> often boast ; and so <UNK> did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were <UNK> to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 5332.129988996529
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 2635.2673012836794
She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . 1614.059212575189
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
Long . 84.01585288197488
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . 1198.827151092007
" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . 3574.0855981036125
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 3151.965218169043
Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . 2994.9258905563693
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . 2820.923626791431
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 3629.222276221084
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 4008.400311631969
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 3073.662428116244
I know how much you dislike him . " " You know nothing of the matter . 1995.0294523085493
Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . 1867.2564665793561
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . 1343.8817355695742
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . 2730.5491141628218
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . 2538.2322743403083
Though Lydia ' s short letter to Mrs . 912.8040433434604
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 5123.4670781832365
how unlucky ! 158.19220124296285
This is my advice . 368.02982539059826
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . 1989.1107352868921
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . 3855.1823673343697
But let me advise you to think better of it . 1201.4590600259235
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! <UNK> our surprise . 4271.699027919494
At length Darcy spoke , and in a <UNK> manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . " " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with <UNK> , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . " Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . 5332.868978176578
Sir William did not say much . 629.4361038041003
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 4686.365807910854
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 3373.058313499921
Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . 2911.477533367944
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 2992.867368086152
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 4272.189561751619
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . 2997.433321814729
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . 1478.192569460245
Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . 2996.033212191526
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . 1610.9326497313289
And , besides , no <UNK> of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then supposing them to be in London . 3153.071218827818
By this time she is actually with them ! 912.8139826283409
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . 2993.1658549569734
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . 2220.698942056359
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 2221.1225472435476
Have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs . 1198.917752767318
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 914.9889913960826
She declared her resolution . 369.30891374757914
II . 83.98610986891775
But make a virtue of it by all means . 1058.7766133255238
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 3152.3570618873828
How I long to see her ! 629.5816880654951
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . 2995.6375958023004
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 4313.798047837566
She saw with the <UNK> eye of fancy , the <UNK> of that gay bathing place covered with officers . 2333.663277745808
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . 1990.0336651976215
" Yet why did he come ? " She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . 3305.50244544667
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . 3231.026826745154
" It may perhaps be pleasant , " replied Charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . 3693.629341014248
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . 3750.9118120805956
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 2110.092564181481
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . But good lord ! 2331.262238613785
That is all to be forgot . 629.5169689701993
I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . " " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <UNK> of you . 5396.415267081794
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . 4312.474539888654
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
I do not know who is good enough for him . " Mr . and Mrs . 1995.5413252432252

After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F . 1477.1064476767056
Gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . 3630.0812549499783
I am perfectly satisfied . 370.31560582597615
<UNK> ' s note <UNK> and <UNK> changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book . 2329.9832725838537
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she . 1616.2521765834451
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . " Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of <UNK> such reflections . 4392.474575603531
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ' s height , or rather <UNK> . " " How I long to see her again ! 2824.376480782922
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . 2225.8549338381586
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ' s two sisters . 3960.9933484969124

But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to <UNK> her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever <UNK> . 4531.709259626753
<UNK> me in silence . 367.78111956580926
" They have both , " said she , " been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . 3307.079189147189
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 2332.6646430072433
Bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone . 1058.115591761389
She answered with equal indifference and <UNK> , and the other said no more . 1744.3517551607597
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . 3505.598200981653
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My <UNK> were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte . 4798.918583587345
" Don ' t keep <UNK> so , Kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! 1872.0765832083312

I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . 1872.0177401155147
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , soon collected them round the table . 3907.929446286182
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . 1991.751182548419
" I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . " " Not at all , " he replied ; " they were <UNK> by the exercise . " A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . 4721.199107319972

She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . 4688.872520877133
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent . 1341.8891720490014
Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? 2330.2997629252422
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 2911.777956664356
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . " Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . 4774.199134045755

Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . 1867.4283002122797
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy ' s regard . " " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? " " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . " " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy . 4776.975183029737
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 1612.1656871520618
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . 2541.035736764894
good or bad ? " " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . 4100.715267845308
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <UNK> society . " " But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . " " Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . 4147.050149781818
His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 2637.7445325390336

The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . " He is now gone into the army , " she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . " Mrs . 4853.911696345705
How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr . Bingley ? " " Not at all . " " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . 3439.5097015750084
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 4388.27030852398

Till this moment , I never knew myself . " From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . 4351.18910846206
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 5759.573557878547
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the <UNK> of my father ' s will , has been <UNK> acquainted with every particular of these transactions . 4529.278830162632
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to <UNK> , and was but slightly affected by his <UNK> of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the <UNK> altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh . 5300.628558767547
With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were <UNK> understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged . 4851.187057220579
They <UNK> their wretchedness , however , by <UNK> after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . 4007.9698840069664
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . 4659.654111864733
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <UNK> the excellent understanding , and <UNK> excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 5317.2589402798085
Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . 3857.125313303824
" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any <UNK> , rather adds to your other perfections . 3078.850739221333
Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general <UNK> , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . 4057.021560542166
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , <UNK> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 2908.8584200135124
It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 1743.810098257313
There was another reason too for her opposition . 913.3498817755317
Why should they try to influence him ? 769.8180920961341
dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . 1476.7501661563456
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ' s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . 3629.8900526489965
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . 2823.483151004168
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back . 1056.6869775895898
CHAPTER XVIII . 158.31985829036464
Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? 2729.694631972582
From what can it proceed ? 494.3143705826925
Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other . 4314.577970458095
She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> . 3961.6019020199683
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . 4853.456601490172
They are destined for each other by the voice of every <UNK> of their <UNK> houses ; and what is to divide them ? 2731.1759013681735
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . 2635.4056716252894
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 3746.7539710129277
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent <UNK> of <UNK> on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . 4145.4795072361385
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? 1476.7501661563456
Charles , when you <UNK> your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 4351.810092530926
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . 1056.2704032244876
An union of a different tendency , and <UNK> the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . 2729.625594464434
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention . 2911.863270287327
Have you had any flirting ? 494.2583925041145
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long . 2537.378193093185

My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him . 1990.1142632741187
can it be really so ! 494.19535782522115
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . 1203.8454055332807
He is gone to my father already . 771.4888420577922
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> . 1203.2904326652765
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . 4312.2288021675
I shall be back by dinner . " " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . 5182.657197816038
He was the <UNK> , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . 2732.8259156076124
A <UNK> life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . 2220.958060811021
Mr . Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . 3374.3171612637702
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 2735.0797381147154
The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in <UNK> and <UNK> , and the evening at one of the <UNK> . 2638.41329940822
I never was . 255.94843071832344
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . 2331.0935821437024
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <UNK> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 4686.802557939617
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his <UNK> , all honoured with the <UNK> of <UNK> , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . 3631.83998575329
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . 3860.6289867685077
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . 3689.025224799081

Hurst ' s gown " Here she was interrupted again . 1199.0194630870026
But it is so strange ! " " Yes that is what makes it amusing . 1870.4494470850766
If he fears me , why come hither ? 913.3988816443591
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . " " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . " " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " I am not . " Lady Catherine seemed pleased . 5408.395905578278
No , no , you shall not deceive me . 1056.5589321943721
Wickham ! 84.00594177133013
<UNK> are too much like <UNK> . 629.249628003732
<UNK> will be absolutely <UNK> , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . 1867.0183487224251
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . 2107.8559760695935
Have a little compassion on my nerves . 769.7544903248415
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh . 3630.029320516526
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? 3751.301193879456
His reception however was of the most flattering kind . 1056.994275348679
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . " " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " And how impossible in others ! " " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? " " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . 5554.07034894245
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . 1057.6951229818358
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . 2223.078061195989
what is it about ? 367.8506245278803
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . 4189.918344904673
In that case he would return no more . 913.3983042072219
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 4312.138872532203
<UNK> and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was <UNK> and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . 3370.7829251104217
He replied , and was again silent . 771.3977711512991
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 3228.249046739455
Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 2635.695561490112
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . 4055.315347700504
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . 3370.849327309949
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> . 1341.9604987603652
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <UNK> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . 5784.95319232021
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 4231.692784665155
" Oh ! 159.45205162549917
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . 1995.0353881837623
Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it . 2107.208616611329
Oh ! 84.05153936934833
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . " Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . 4901.816306832674
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy ' s meditated elopement . 1741.2803314018845
Her <UNK> are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . 3689.3399019370777
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . 2823.9054209529772
single , my dear , to be sure ! 912.9332893408971
This cannot be ! engaged to Mr . Darcy ! 1056.8791792393388
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . 494.3213192419087
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . 2331.6914926202007
The Miss <UNK> all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . Do you draw ? " " No , not at all . " " What , none of you ? " " Not one . " " That is very strange . 4391.529076433088
<UNK> was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . 3745.9742251056186
" We can all plague and punish one another . 1060.328713346027
Is not he a charming man ? 629.3874594644163
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her <UNK> intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . 4563.50445980906
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most <UNK> character ! 2540.687461250257
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 3152.93586792527
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . 2730.3429034334554
CHAPTER VI . 158.32627053238474
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 5553.150469901012
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? " Nothing less than the complaisance of a <UNK> could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most <UNK> courtesy . 5178.493644654926
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " There can be no doubt of that . 2820.579989051451
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 3912.276173670392
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . 4145.891498063726
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 2540.67543024457
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . 2223.770363771073
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> . 3629.2993305224786
so much the man of fashion ! 629.3307260716773
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 3745.860545703573
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . " " I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 4745.261095431268
it is of no consequence . 494.2443870801154
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 2107.357120393592
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . 1199.5947097311982
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 2540.5516575090114
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <UNK> than to herself . 1339.8403360158893
But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 3960.7719056771593
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the <UNK> , and was soon out of sight . 3438.8122457090826
The party did not supply much conversation . 771.7963143228671
Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg tm <UNK> upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and <UNK> works that can be freely distributed in <UNK> readable form <UNK> by the widest <UNK> of equipment including <UNK> equipment . 4656.506505985798
What is it you are talking of ? 770.0628748823699
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 1477.3772998158804
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 2330.3410757358874
CHAPTER VIII . 158.33268212522805
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . 1867.5203506724179
" I never heard any thing so abominable . 917.1979095636507
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ' s regiment . " His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative . 4314.180019187055
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to <UNK> these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 4233.582108321577
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley is not he ? 1741.6170320764631
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of <UNK> was delightful to her , and she began her song . 4100.514036505513
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 1479.9569492195046
Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 1990.7057883024881
" Kitty and I are going <UNK> to sit in my dressing room . " Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room . 4235.132453727242
Poor Lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . 3073.6760554163952
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it . 5162.8973048513935
Mr . Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . 2823.7692224344005
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . 1477.6078263652373
" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! " said she . 1481.4581969837914
I remain , dear sir , with <UNK> compliments to your lady and daughters , your well <UNK> and friend , <UNK> <UNK> . " " At four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he <UNK> up the letter . 4499.688241617164
Bennet ' s <UNK> was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter . 2222.895129216935
I dare say he often <UNK> worse things said than I am going to say . 1872.057524608555
Mrs . 84.28665600062531
London Printed for T . 367.8332608041528
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . 913.3589176897902
It was then <UNK> in the following manner . 915.1994082157562
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! 4353.019303394002
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . 3910.3213000436854
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of <UNK> should not be broken in on . 2729.6808282419406
Mr . Darcy was <UNK> him with <UNK> wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . 3303.9282535930743
" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . " " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . " Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . 5105.713100612538
It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ? 1992.7455289140257
But she would not be secure . 631.2805783864613
He had to be sure done much . 771.5525214023329
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him . 1742.3612421312614
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 4355.422525631685
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 4798.928080272544
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus <UNK> my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to <UNK> your authority in my behalf . 4461.93123462266
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . " " Your first <UNK> is false . 3229.288771177238
And to be kept back on such a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . " " Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? " " With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . " Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . 5663.523079917762
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford . 769.6999538881013
" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! 1994.5383926391326
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 3907.525408308044
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . 1477.6324684610192
" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr . Darcy ? " " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . " " I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . 5480.492769073361
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . 1870.1339921558588
" Oh ! 159.45205162549917
