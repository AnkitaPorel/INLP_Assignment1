This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true <UNK> will derive benefit from such as are given . 1.7082763938087104
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you . 2.51188643150958
" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of <UNK> in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ' s regard for me . 1.7082763938087104
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle . 3.359818286283782
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . 1.8632463119315603
Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
I had not an idea of it . " Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . 1.8329807108324359
A most delightful place ! <UNK> Parsonage House ! 8.11130830789687
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> . 1.93069772888325
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 2.610157215682537
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 1.6876124757881477
She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 1.6681005372000588
She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . 1.5199110829529336
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . 3.359818286283782
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . 4.216965034285822
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 1.93069772888325
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 2.9935772947204895
" And that , " said Mrs . 10.000000000000002
If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 2.610157215682537
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill <UNK> of Lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . 1.6681005372000588
In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <UNK> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 1.3433993325989002
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister . 6.812920690579612
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 1.3708385261355818
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . 2.7213387683753076
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 6.812920690579612
It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . 3.359818286283782
I am not qualified to form one . 10.000000000000002
His surprise was great . 26.82695795279726
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . 6.812920690579612
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . " Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . 1.632172128563275
The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of <UNK> , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her <UNK> <UNK> . 1.3593563908785256
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 2.0535250264571463
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . " " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an <UNK> , <UNK> disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will <UNK> the whole room , and be handed down to <UNK> with all the <UNK> of a <UNK> . " " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he . 1.16127496875312

but no one can throw any blame on them . 6.812920690579612
But , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 2.8480358684358014
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 1.7301957388458942
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 2.51188643150958
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very <UNK> in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . 1.4773776525985112
She longed to see Mrs . 17.78279410038923

Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . The possibility of his having really endured such <UNK> , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained . 1.2238249369681928
These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 2.154434690031884
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . 1.8329807108324359
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley ' s behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . 1.3485595530525598
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . " " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 1.4677992676220695
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much . 1.5199110829529336
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her <UNK> you . " Mrs . 1.5706464294715548
Long has promised to introduce him . " " I do not believe Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 2.610157215682537
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 1.557068404753731
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 1.632172128563275
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . 8.11130830789687
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 3.1622776601683795
My courage always <UNK> with every attempt to <UNK> me . " " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . " Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . 1.221677348996792
That is all to be forgot . 12.915496650148839
When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . 1.8329807108324359
I had no notion but he would go a <UNK> , or something or other , and not <UNK> us with his company . 2.4244620170823286
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . 4.216965034285822
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they <UNK> with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy . 1.3708385261355818
But we must <UNK> the tide of malice , and <UNK> into the wounded <UNK> of each other , the <UNK> of sisterly consolation . " Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " <UNK> as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is <UNK> that one false step <UNK> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <UNK> than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 1.19708503049573
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 6.812920690579612
Every thing , however , went on <UNK> , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ' s first sketch . 2.7213387683753076
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . 1.632172128563275
<UNK> , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . 2.610157215682537
She will not be able to help calling . " " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 1.3485595530525598
I would keep a pack of <UNK> , and drink a bottle of wine every day . " " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . 1.8632463119315603
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 2.610157215682537
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ' s <UNK> , and complimented her on bearing it so well . 2.8480358684358014
There is a <UNK> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . 2.9935772947204895
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . 1.365007806546014
They entered it in one of its <UNK> points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , <UNK> over a wide extent . 2.2758459260747883
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the <UNK> of a considerable <UNK> , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . 1.5199110829529336
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement <UNK> the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be <UNK> to make the <UNK> disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law . 1.7301957388458942
" If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs . 4.641588833612778
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . " " Good <UNK> ! " cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? How could his will be <UNK> ? Why did not you seek legal <UNK> ? " " There was just such an <UNK> in the terms of the <UNK> as to give me no hope from law . 1.324192791886045
you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 1.2096079377043663
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . 2.8480358684358014
It is Mr . Bingley I am sure . 8.11130830789687
In ran Mrs . 46.415888336127786
It was a fortnight since Mrs . 12.915496650148839
There was also a postscript to this effect . 8.11130830789687
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . 1.8632463119315603
They are gone off together from Brighton . 10.000000000000002
came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the <UNK> , and at the <UNK> in Barnet and <UNK> , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . 1.8047217668271702
Give me farther particulars . 26.82695795279726
Mr . Collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . 1.8632463119315603
My poor father ! 46.415888336127786
When they repaired to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 1.8047217668271702
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a <UNK> , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! 2.2122162910704493
Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . 1.3485595530525598
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " I never heard that it was . " " And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . 1.5441135899948315
This letter is from Mr . Collins . " " From Mr . Collins ! 3.8746751204561316
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . 1.6876124757881477
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . 2.51188643150958
Perhaps I am not doing her justice . 10.000000000000002
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . 1.8957356524063758
mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to day ? 4.216965034285822
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 6.812920690579612
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . 1.778279410038923
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . " " Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . 1.4873521072935114
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . " Hunsford , near <UNK> , Kent , th <UNK> . DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . " There , Mrs . 1.1733955704930705
But Georgiana would not join her . 12.915496650148839
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 1.3593563908785256
<UNK> donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any <UNK> concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States . 2.4244620170823286
Bennet . 316.22776601683796
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling . 1.6496480740980204
" Oh ! 100.00000000000004
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of <UNK> whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to <UNK> , she began to regret that he came . 1.4497406703726319
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . " " But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . " " Let me be rightly understood . 1.4977474763452014
has she any family ? " " She has one only daughter , the <UNK> of Rosings , and of very extensive property . " " Ah ! " cried Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
Lord bless me ! 46.415888336127786
But Mrs . 100.00000000000004
Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night <UNK> and <UNK> gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty <UNK> away . " " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " " You go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds ! 1.2478254704700218
" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? " " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . " " La ! " replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . 1.4174741629268053
<UNK> was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . 1.778279410038923
When is your turn to come ? 12.915496650148839
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . 2.610157215682537
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr . Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and <UNK> the prospects of Mr . Wickham . <UNK> and <UNK> to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a <UNK> , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the <UNK> of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the <UNK> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd . I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ' s accidental information , that Bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . 1.0692266318431725
But I knew I should persuade you at last . 6.812920690579612
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 2.610157215682537
But let me advise you to think better of it . 5.878016072274914
and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! 5.878016072274914
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . 1.8047217668271702
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 2.8480358684358014
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . 1.5441135899948315

Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 26.82695795279726
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <UNK> her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 1.5706464294715548
My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . 2.4244620170823286
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what <UNK> his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 1.3768571648527583
CHAPTER V . 100.00000000000004
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . 3.8746751204561316
Till this moment , I never knew myself . " From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . 1.5441135899948315
Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their <UNK> in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . 1.3593563908785256
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 3.1622776601683795
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <UNK> satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 1.8047217668271702
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . " " In what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought Elizabeth . 1.8957356524063758
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon <UNK> deliberation , you find that the misery of <UNK> his two sisters is more than <UNK> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . " " How can you talk so ? " said Jane <UNK> smiling , " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . " " I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . " " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 1.1380983017100623
so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! 8.11130830789687
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 1.5441135899948315
" Yours , c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . 1.8957356524063758
He readily agreed to it . 17.78279410038923
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 1.9684194472866121
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my <UNK> on your privilege of universal good will . 2.610157215682537
Adieu to disappointment and <UNK> . 17.78279410038923
Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active <UNK> , and when immediately before my father ' s death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . " " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth . 1.3433993325989002
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 1.8047217668271702
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold enough to say before how much I like him . 1.8957356524063758
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . 1.93069772888325
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . " " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . 1.5441135899948315
She was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . 1.5085907086001784
She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 2.2122162910704493
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 2.7213387683753076
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> . 1.7082763938087104
Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . " Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . 1.8957356524063758
It cannot last long . 26.82695795279726
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ' s . 3.359818286283782
He could number the <UNK> in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <UNK> . 2.51188643150958
" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 1.4030037231905736
Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon <UNK> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 1.93069772888325
Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions , all of which are confirmed as <UNK> <UNK> in the U . S . unless a copyright notice is included . 1.93069772888325
" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not <UNK> declare that Caroline neither <UNK> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <UNK> the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly ! to put me on my guard ? 1.4412195967188537
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 2.0092330025650473
I enquired after their brother , of course . 8.11130830789687
" DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations . 4.216965034285822
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 3.593813663804627
" Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . 3.593813663804627
My mother was in <UNK> , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! 1.8957356524063758
He still loves me , and we are engaged . " Jane looked at her <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
where is your <UNK> my dear ? " But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 2.0535250264571463
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . 1.4773776525985112
He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia . 5.878016072274914
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! 3.359818286283782
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please . 2.346228848142263
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family ! 1.5085907086001784
The adieu is <UNK> itself . 17.78279410038923
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two <UNK> with Jane again , and the two <UNK> with Lizzy , and the <UNK> " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! 1.4174741629268053
" ' Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much . 3.593813663804627
The express was sent off directly . 12.915496650148839
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 1.4412195967188537
In this <UNK> state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 1.3708385261355818
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! 2.8480358684358014
Mr . Wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a <UNK> as she could . 1.8957356524063758
As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it <UNK> and lovely as ever . 1.5085907086001784
" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living . 2.9935772947204895
CHAPTER XVII . 100.00000000000004
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 3.1622776601683795
But pride where there is a real <UNK> of mind , pride will be always under good <UNK> . " Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . 2.154434690031884
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an <UNK> on every subject . 4.216965034285822
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . " Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . 1.4585940117250362
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . " " I should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother . 1.5998587196060583
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 1.5848931924611136
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield . 2.610157215682537
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with <UNK> civility , " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ? 1.7082763938087104
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 4.641588833612778
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been <UNK> , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . 1.7301957388458942
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . 2.51188643150958
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 2.8480358684358014
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . 3.593813663804627
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry . 2.0092330025650473
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will <UNK> excite . 1.7301957388458942
She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . 2.154434690031884
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 1.2589254117941673
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard . 3.593813663804627
To Mr . and Mrs . 17.78279410038923
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> . 1.8329807108324359
There is a mixture of <UNK> and self importance in his letter , which promises well . 3.359818286283782
Bennet was most <UNK> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 1.4977474763452014
" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . 1.8957356524063758
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 2.154434690031884
A few weeks , he believed . 12.915496650148839
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <UNK> , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . 1.9684194472866121
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . 1.2505106035854068
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 1.5848931924611136
Mr . Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . 1.41011239906908
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . 1.425102670302998
Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a <UNK> chaise . " " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , <UNK> against the <UNK> conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . 1.3768571648527583
" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . 2.0535250264571463
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <UNK> family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . 1.7301957388458942
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 1.778279410038923
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 2.2758459260747883
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 1.557068404753731
They <UNK> their wretchedness , however , by <UNK> after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . 1.6681005372000588
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . 5.878016072274914
" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party . 2.0535250264571463
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " As Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . 2.2122162910704493
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the <UNK> Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . 1.4873521072935114
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . 1.5848931924611136
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . 3.359818286283782
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <UNK> of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James ' s , with very decent composure . 1.6496480740980204
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <UNK> <UNK> on the probability of each statement but with little success . 2.154434690031884
Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . 1.5848931924611136
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 2.0092330025650473
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word . 3.8746751204561316
My affections and wishes are <UNK> , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . " Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very <UNK> , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . 1.295267744355328
Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side . 1.9684194472866121
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 6.812920690579612
Her report was highly favourable . 17.78279410038923
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did . 5.878016072274914
" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . 3.593813663804627
My feelings will not be repressed . 12.915496650148839
On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . 2.610157215682537
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . 4.641588833612778
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . 3.593813663804627
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 2.7213387683753076
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr . Darcy . " She then sought her eldest sister , who had <UNK> to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . 1.7534865500829584
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <UNK> <UNK> her there . 3.359818286283782
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . 2.9935772947204895
It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ? 3.359818286283782
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 2.8480358684358014
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . 1.3768571648527583
and so extremely accomplished for her age ! 10.000000000000002
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have <UNK> domestic felicity in so <UNK> a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . 1.2990813969063477
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 2.2122162910704493
Kitty and Lydia take his <UNK> much more to heart than I do . 4.216965034285822
Oh , sister ! 46.415888336127786
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley . 3.1622776601683795
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 1.7301957388458942
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 2.2758459260747883
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 1.4497406703726319
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . 2.610157215682537
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . 1.5199110829529336
Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . 2.8480358684358014
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 3.8746751204561316
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . 3.359818286283782
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 3.593813663804627
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? 5.878016072274914
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 3.8746751204561316
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 5.878016072274914
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very <UNK> manner , with all the <UNK> which he supposed a regular part of the business . 1.425102670302998
To no creature had it been revealed , where <UNK> was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 1.5199110829529336
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . 4.641588833612778
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and <UNK> every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the <UNK> of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 1.5199110829529336
<UNK> , teazing , man ! 17.78279410038923
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . 2.51188643150958
On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . 1.2915496650148839
And poor Mr . Darcy ! 17.78279410038923
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . 3.359818286283782
She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most <UNK> by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . 1.7082763938087104
But the case is this . 17.78279410038923
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . 2.0535250264571463
One day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . 2.1017480113324885
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . 5.179474679231212
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 2.2758459260747883
Where does discretion end , and <UNK> begin ? 8.11130830789687
They called at various times of the morning , sometimes <UNK> , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . 2.4244620170823286
As for your Elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what <UNK> could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye <UNK> , so remarkably fine , might be copied . " At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . 1.3433993325989002
Her answer was warmly in his favour . 10.000000000000002
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation . 2.1017480113324885
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 1.4677992676220695
Have not you always hated him ? " How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! 2.154434690031884
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 3.359818286283782
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 3.8746751204561316
Ten thousand a year ! 26.82695795279726
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . 2.8480358684358014
When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs . 5.878016072274914
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " " Ten thousand pounds ! 2.346228848142263
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 10.000000000000002
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side . 1.3485595530525598
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 2.8480358684358014
Jane was by no means better . 12.915496650148839
Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 2.2122162910704493
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though <UNK> with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 1.3768571648527583
Her <UNK> are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . 1.8047217668271702
Mr . Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . 2.2758459260747883
The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 3.593813663804627
At present we have nothing to guide us . 8.11130830789687
His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . 2.0535250264571463
She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . 1.41011239906908
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . " Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . 1.4174741629268053
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you . 3.359818286283782
To know that her daughter would be married was enough . 5.878016072274914
I expected you to stay two months . 10.000000000000002
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it . 1.319720393061375

Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated . 1.53174046370208
After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . 5.878016072274914
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ' s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . 1.333521432163324
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 1.5441135899948315
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . 5.878016072274914
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . 5.179474679231212
" Oh ! 100.00000000000004
They followed her into the dining parlour . 10.000000000000002
It was all conjecture . " " What is it you mean ? " " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing . " " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . " " And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . 1.324192791886045
<UNK> , of course . If you mention my name at the <UNK> , you will be attended to . " Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . 1.365007806546014
Heaven and <UNK> ! of what are you thinking ? 6.812920690579612
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " " Are you , indeed ? 2.9935772947204895
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! 12.915496650148839
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 3.359818286283782
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . 6.812920690579612
Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . 1.7534865500829584
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! 1.778279410038923
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party . 4.641588833612778
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 1.6496480740980204
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " Their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . 1.28792362543363
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . " " In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . 1.6681005372000588
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 1.6496480740980204
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh . 12.915496650148839
Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody ' s reserve , can be answerable for the event . 2.154434690031884
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . 1.4497406703726319
oh ! 316.22776601683796
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 1.7301957388458942
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . 3.1622776601683795
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . " CHAPTER IV . 1.7534865500829584
U . S . laws alone <UNK> our small <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . 1.6876124757881477
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 2.0535250264571463
She blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who <UNK> their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . 2.4244620170823286
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 3.8746751204561316
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 3.359818286283782
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . 1.425102670302998
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten . 2.8480358684358014
" <UNK> . 100.00000000000004
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . 2.9935772947204895
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so doubtful , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea . 1.3894954943731377
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 10.000000000000002
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had <UNK> to his amusement . 2.610157215682537
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . 5.878016072274914
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . 3.359818286283782
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 2.0535250264571463
That tall , proud man . " " Good gracious ! 5.878016072274914
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! 3.1622776601683795
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , <UNK> , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . 1.5848931924611136
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . 1.2648552168552962
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 1.6681005372000588
Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . 5.179474679231212
" I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the <UNK> and public places . 2.4244620170823286
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . " As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . 1.324192791886045
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . 2.2758459260747883
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 1.778279410038923
" Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . 2.8480358684358014
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . 2.154434690031884
It was a rational scheme to be sure ! 8.11130830789687
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 1.8957356524063758
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . 2.346228848142263
intending to trace their route . 17.78279410038923
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 2.51188643150958
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " cried Elizabeth . 2.0535250264571463
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley . 1.778279410038923
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time . 1.8329807108324359
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as <UNK> , were in very good time . 1.8329807108324359
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long . 2.610157215682537
CHAPTER <UNK> . 100.00000000000004
Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him . 2.2758459260747883
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . 5.878016072274914
I know your disposition , Lizzy . 12.915496650148839
His temptation is not <UNK> to the risk . " " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment . 2.2122162910704493
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile it was decided . 2.346228848142263
" If they had uncles enough to <UNK> all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one <UNK> less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . 1.557068404753731
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . 2.7213387683753076
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . 2.2122162910704493
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins . 1.9684194472866121
Jenkinson to make up her party . 12.915496650148839
CHAPTER XIX . 100.00000000000004
I always said it must be so , at last . 5.878016072274914
She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 5.878016072274914
can it be really so ! 17.78279410038923
The old lady is Mrs . 17.78279410038923
She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr . Darcy , she moved again towards the gate . 2.0092330025650473
Elizabeth , after slightly <UNK> it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . 3.593813663804627
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . 1.6876124757881477
Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1.4677992676220695
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . 3.593813663804627
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 1.5085907086001784
CHAPTER IX . 100.00000000000004
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to <UNK> as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was . 1.6876124757881477
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . 2.2758459260747883
Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party . 2.610157215682537
My dear Charles , what do you mean ? " " Yes , all of them , I think . 2.8480358684358014
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . 6.812920690579612
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with <UNK> and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as <UNK> an air as possible . " Mr . Bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . 1.3153690504363762
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 1.2238249369681928
But , in my opinion , it is a paltry <UNK> , a very mean art . " " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is <UNK> in all the arts which ladies sometimes <UNK> to employ for <UNK> . 1.557068404753731
Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . 2.8480358684358014
Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <UNK> . 1.4773776525985112
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 2.154434690031884
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . 1.8329807108324359
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 2.7213387683753076
But I will no longer <UNK> my young cousin . " Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his <UNK> at backgammon . 2.2122162910704493
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 3.593813663804627
They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy . 1.4977474763452014
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . 3.593813663804627
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . " " She is a very fine looking woman ! 2.2122162910704493
" How <UNK> have I acted ! " she cried . " I , who have <UNK> myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! 1.9684194472866121
" While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . 2.0092330025650473
what felicity ! 100.00000000000004
I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . 2.9935772947204895
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . 2.346228848142263
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . 4.216965034285822
If I wished to think <UNK> of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however . " " If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . " " Yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . " " This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . 1.353876180022544
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . 10.000000000000002
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 4.641588833612778
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <UNK> ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had <UNK> , in his offer to herself . 1.5848931924611136
Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . 1.8957356524063758
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . 4.216965034285822
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments . 2.4244620170823286
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 5.878016072274914
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 1.632172128563275
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees . 1.93069772888325
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> ! 4.216965034285822
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . 2.346228848142263
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . 2.8480358684358014
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . 1.93069772888325
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . 3.8746751204561316
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our <UNK> ! 1.3894954943731377
Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 2.2122162910704493
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or <UNK> distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more <UNK> blind . 1.557068404753731
" He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 1.93069772888325
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook , complying with the rules is very easy . 2.8480358684358014
She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . 2.4244620170823286
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 2.610157215682537
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . 3.1622776601683795
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . " " What should not you mind ? " " I should not mind any thing at all . " " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . " " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail . 1.3894954943731377
CHAPTER XII . 100.00000000000004
The Foundation makes no <UNK> concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States . 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . 6.812920690579612
Mr . Darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . 5.878016072274914
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels . 3.1622776601683795
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . 1.7082763938087104
I am most seriously displeased . " Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . 2.0092330025650473
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 5.878016072274914
" You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 2.2758459260747883
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh ! 6.812920690579612
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 2.9935772947204895
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 2.2122162910704493
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . 3.8746751204561316
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled . " A gentleman and a stranger ! 4.641588833612778
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it <UNK> , has surprised me a good deal . 1.8957356524063758
But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . 5.179474679231212
<UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . 1.4773776525985112
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 1.5998587196060583
The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . 1.5199110829529336
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . 1.8957356524063758
Mr . Darcy ! 46.415888336127786
<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 17.78279410038923
Your mother <UNK> upon your accepting it . 10.000000000000002
Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical . 8.11130830789687
I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 1.8329807108324359
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 2.7213387683753076
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more . 5.179474679231212
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <UNK> by the possessor , and often without any attention to the <UNK> of the performance . 2.154434690031884
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . 2.0535250264571463
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . 2.51188643150958
I have no such <UNK> to resent . 10.000000000000002
He begged pardon for having displeased her . 10.000000000000002
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . 5.179474679231212
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . " " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose . 2.346228848142263
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . 2.9935772947204895
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <UNK> by Wickham . 1.93069772888325
She <UNK> the days that must <UNK> before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . 2.8480358684358014
Collins , did I tell you of Lady <UNK> ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? 3.359818286283782
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . 1.615598098439874
They will ruin your happiness . 17.78279410038923
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . 3.593813663804627
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general <UNK> to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . 1.5998587196060583
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well . 3.359818286283782
Besides , it will not much signify what one <UNK> this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . " " Are they indeed ? " cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . 1.6681005372000588
" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt . 2.346228848142263
Why any fear of detection ? 17.78279410038923
After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F . 4.641588833612778
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 10.000000000000002
Section . 316.22776601683796
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 1.557068404753731
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional <UNK> in praise of his own humble abode , and the <UNK> it was receiving , he was happily employed <UNK> the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . 1.5848931924611136
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1.8047217668271702
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . 2.7213387683753076
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . 2.51188643150958
How strange must it appear to him ! 10.000000000000002
How well it <UNK> . 26.82695795279726
Pray read on . " " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she <UNK> so disgraceful a match . 1.3768571648527583
But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . 1.5441135899948315
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . 1.8632463119315603
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . 3.8746751204561316
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . 10.000000000000002
She saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . 1.615598098439874
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . 2.7213387683753076
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be <UNK> from it . 2.1017480113324885
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ' s height , or rather <UNK> . " " How I long to see her again ! 2.346228848142263
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 2.9935772947204895
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . " " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 1.778279410038923
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . 2.8480358684358014
GARDINER . " " Is it possible ! " cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . 3.359818286283782
She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa . 4.216965034285822
" It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . 2.0092330025650473
This cannot be ! engaged to Mr . Darcy ! 6.812920690579612
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . " Elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . 2.4244620170823286
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . " Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right . 1.8957356524063758
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ' s folly . " " Indeed you are mistaken . 2.1017480113324885
. <UNK> . The copyright laws of the place where you are located also <UNK> what you can do with this work . 2.51188643150958
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions . 1.778279410038923
Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 2.51188643150958
<UNK> , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . 4.641588833612778
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . 2.7213387683753076
I know no harm of her . " " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her <UNK> ' s death made her mistress of this fortune . " " No why should he ? 1.778279410038923
You refuse , then , to oblige me . 8.11130830789687
The t te t te surprised them . 10.000000000000002
And his behaviour , so <UNK> altered , what could it mean ? 4.641588833612778
You are so strange ! 26.82695795279726
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <UNK> for Mr . Darcy ' s pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham . 1.1164695682554597
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . 2.610157215682537
" Of music ! 46.415888336127786
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to <UNK> her confidence in it . 1.93069772888325
" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . 4.216965034285822
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for <UNK> him also with Lizzy . 2.346228848142263
shocking ! " cried Miss Bingley . 12.915496650148839
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . 1.8632463119315603
When the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , <UNK> her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment <UNK> . 1.4773776525985112
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 2.346228848142263
I do not know who is good enough for him . " Mr . and Mrs . 3.359818286283782
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . " " If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . 1.4497406703726319
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room . 1.9684194472866121
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . 1.6876124757881477
She then took a large house in <UNK> street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . 2.9935772947204895
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such <UNK> , and her intreaty that she would not give into it . 2.2122162910704493
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell . 3.8746751204561316
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long . 3.8746751204561316
When the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a <UNK> to her mother ' s <UNK> for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . 1.396135390856794
" You look pale . 26.82695795279726
Bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . 3.593813663804627
But now it was all too natural . 10.000000000000002
All field <UNK> were over . 17.78279410038923
Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . " " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . " " I believe , Ma ' am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . " " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . 1.2775649214671148
But don ' t imagine it was from any silly cause . 5.179474679231212
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , c . 1.7082763938087104
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . 3.359818286283782
My father bears it better . 17.78279410038923
<UNK> are settled so <UNK> . " " You <UNK> perhaps to the entail of this estate . " " Ah ! 2.610157215682537
After walking several miles in a <UNK> manner , and too <UNK> to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their <UNK> , that it was time to be at home . 1.778279410038923
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in <UNK> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " said Jane as she finished it . 1.4585940117250362
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . 6.812920690579612

As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner ' s hope of Lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its <UNK> . 1.8957356524063758
I congratulate her . 46.415888336127786
But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! 10.000000000000002
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . 2.0535250264571463
Why must their marriage be private ? 12.915496650148839
But now it comes out . " " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows . 3.1622776601683795
Their manners are not equal to his . " " Certainly not ; at first . 3.593813663804627
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . 1.53174046370208
As she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs . 5.878016072274914
Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for . 4.641588833612778
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . " " I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 1.2195704601594413
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . 1.4677992676220695
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head <UNK> acutely . 3.1622776601683795
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
On entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . 1.4873521072935114
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 1.4773776525985112

I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 1.9684194472866121
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . " " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " And how impossible in others ! " " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? " " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . 1.2352165993694857
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <UNK> ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 2.346228848142263
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . 2.1017480113324885
This will never do . " " You need not distress yourself . 4.641588833612778
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 3.1622776601683795
Elizabeth , <UNK> all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . 1.4174741629268053
Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach . 2.4244620170823286
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . " " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were <UNK> and insolent . 1.242623671911505
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . 1.7534865500829584
We acted with the best intentions . " " Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " He brought it with him for us to see . " Jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to Elizabeth . 1.53174046370208
" Yes , Ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as <UNK> to the poor . " Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . 1.7082763938087104
Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . 1.6496480740980204
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday . 1.3485595530525598
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 2.0535250264571463
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . 5.179474679231212
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 3.8746751204561316
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . 5.179474679231212
Any other inconsistencies with modern <UNK> have been left as printed . 5.179474679231212
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <UNK> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . 1.1905772393787835
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over <UNK> , as I always am . 2.346228848142263
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . 3.1622776601683795
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 1.4977474763452014
Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces . 2.7213387683753076
" Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 1.3830728955554412
" It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . 1.5441135899948315
In Three Volumes . 46.415888336127786
<UNK> wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . 1.632172128563275
But think no more of the letter . 10.000000000000002
When Mrs . 100.00000000000004
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . 1.396135390856794
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 100.00000000000004
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 2.9935772947204895
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening . 1.9684194472866121
On the following Monday , Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Bennet was <UNK> in her acknowledgments . 12.915496650148839
We have heard nothing from town . " " Dear madam , " cried Mrs . 3.593813663804627
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . 2.8480358684358014
" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister . 1.9684194472866121
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! 5.878016072274914
She will follow wherever Lydia leads . 12.915496650148839
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy . 2.0092330025650473
The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 1.7301957388458942
She could not <UNK> him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . 2.610157215682537
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her <UNK> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . 1.615598098439874
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . 4.641588833612778
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . 2.154434690031884
The possibility of Mr . Collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins ! 1.324192791886045
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
A fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little . 6.812920690579612
He takes them now for people of fashion . " The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she <UNK> a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his <UNK> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . 1.4330125702369627
" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . 3.8746751204561316
I am very glad you liked her . 10.000000000000002
Annesley is with her . 26.82695795279726
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . 3.593813663804627
She has known him only a fortnight . 10.000000000000002
Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the <UNK> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . 1.53174046370208
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 2.346228848142263
My temper I dare not vouch for . It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world . 2.346228848142263
. F . . Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph . F . , this work is provided to you ' <UNK> <UNK> ' , <UNK> NO <UNK> WARRANTIES OF ANY <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF <UNK> OR <UNK> FOR ANY <UNK> . 1.4677992676220695
Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age . 1.93069772888325
Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . 3.593813663804627
I think I have heard you say that you know them . " " I know them a little . 2.8480358684358014
Mr . Darcy may <UNK> himself . " " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried Elizabeth . 2.51188643150958
<UNK> is subject to the trademark license , especially <UNK> <UNK> . 5.179474679231212
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost . 2.2758459260747883
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . 3.8746751204561316
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! 4.216965034285822
Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . 6.812920690579612
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard <UNK> in any of the family . 1.93069772888325
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 1.4412195967188537
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 1.93069772888325
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 8.11130830789687
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? 3.8746751204561316
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 1.6876124757881477
But slyness seems the fashion . 17.78279410038923
are quite well . " " But you How are you ? " cried Elizabeth . 3.593813663804627
" I am sure there is not on his . 6.812920690579612
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . " To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . 1.778279410038923
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open <UNK> rejected . 2.2122162910704493
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . 5.878016072274914
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! 5.179474679231212
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the <UNK> , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 1.4873521072935114
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 1.7301957388458942
Forster , the delight of Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Dear me ! 100.00000000000004
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world . 2.610157215682537
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <UNK> . 4.216965034285822
Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . " Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . 1.6681005372000588
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" Good gracious ! " cried Mrs . 10.000000000000002
<UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her . 1.5706464294715548
Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley . 3.593813663804627
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . 1.5441135899948315
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 1.4977474763452014
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 1.6876124757881477
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 5.179474679231212
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 1.93069772888325
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 1.4677992676220695
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 1.3485595530525598
Is not he a charming man ? 12.915496650148839
See paragraph . E below . 17.78279410038923
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 5.179474679231212
no , no , this is not likely . 8.11130830789687
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 2.2758459260747883
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 3.8746751204561316
But so they always are . 17.78279410038923
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane " I hope and trust they will yet be happy . 1.6876124757881477
it cannot be . 46.415888336127786
And for this we are to be thankful . 8.11130830789687
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 5.179474679231212
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . 2.51188643150958
Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , <UNK> that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ? 1.2154742500762865
Lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 1.778279410038923
In the first place , she persisted in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might be broken off . 1.5199110829529336
Good bye . " She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she <UNK> about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . 2.0535250264571463
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 4.641588833612778
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . 1.9684194472866121
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 3.359818286283782
She dared not even mention that gentleman . 10.000000000000002
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . 5.878016072274914
" We can all plague and punish one another . 6.812920690579612
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Their visits to Mrs . 26.82695795279726
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . " " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . 2.154434690031884
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . 4.216965034285822
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <UNK> them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 1.615598098439874
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . 1.8957356524063758
Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise . 8.11130830789687
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <UNK> with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 2.0535250264571463
my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned . 3.359818286283782
Lydia laughed , and said , " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . 3.1622776601683795
<UNK> or twice she could discern a <UNK> blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . 2.9935772947204895
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 5.179474679231212
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . 2.8480358684358014
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 1.93069772888325
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . " " You observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . " " Certainly not . " " To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! 1.302994338575022
How odious I should think them ! " " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " " I am afraid you do not like your pen . 1.41011239906908
<UNK> more than half a day ' s journey . 6.812920690579612
The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . 1.8632463119315603
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . 2.51188643150958
Bennet was <UNK> the fire . 17.78279410038923
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 2.7213387683753076
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? 3.1622776601683795
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified . 3.8746751204561316
" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . " Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . 1.5441135899948315
" And is this all ? " cried Elizabeth . 6.812920690579612
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <UNK> of a bad day . 2.2758459260747883
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . 2.346228848142263
You must not suspect me . 17.78279410038923
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . 2.346228848142263
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such <UNK> as these . 2.7213387683753076
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 1.8957356524063758
You know my sentiments . " " You are then resolved to have him ? " " I have said no such thing . 2.4244620170823286
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . 6.812920690579612
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . 2.4244620170823286
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . 2.8480358684358014
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . 1.8632463119315603
I was uncomfortable enough . 26.82695795279726
Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . 3.593813663804627
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 1.7082763938087104
Thank Heaven ! 100.00000000000004

You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that <UNK> is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . 1.3433993325989002
<UNK> Kitty ! 100.00000000000004
" <UNK> Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at <UNK> , if the drawing room were larger ; but <UNK> is too far off ! 1.7534865500829584
They have at least that advantage . " " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . 2.1017480113324885
How could I be so silly as to wish it ! 5.878016072274914
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . 3.593813663804627
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . 1.5848931924611136
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <UNK> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 2.0535250264571463
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater <UNK> than first <UNK> often boast ; and so <UNK> did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were <UNK> to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 1.2809343786525484
Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 1.3433993325989002
Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits <UNK> high . 2.0535250264571463
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . 4.216965034285822
A regard for the <UNK> would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . 2.346228848142263
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 1.53174046370208
Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . 1.6876124757881477
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . 2.154434690031884
" Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair . 4.641588833612778
She had no fear of its <UNK> farther , through his means . 4.641588833612778
Mr . Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . 2.610157215682537
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 2.9935772947204895
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . 5.179474679231212
But I suppose you had no opportunity . 10.000000000000002
She continued in very <UNK> reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 1.8047217668271702
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . 3.1622776601683795
They <UNK> it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . 2.51188643150958
CHAPTER XV . 100.00000000000004
But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . 2.9935772947204895
His letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in <UNK> business , he was quick in its execution . 2.8480358684358014
Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . 3.359818286283782
Hill and the two <UNK> . 17.78279410038923
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs . 1.7301957388458942
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall <UNK> a list , according to his information . 2.0535250264571463
But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . 1.8047217668271702
" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face . 2.610157215682537
Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
Your ' s , very sincerely , " <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? " " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . 1.3593563908785256
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 2.154434690031884
I remain , dear sir , with <UNK> compliments to your lady and daughters , your well <UNK> and friend , <UNK> <UNK> . " " At four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he <UNK> up the letter . 1.4977474763452014
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent . 1.7301957388458942
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . 2.346228848142263
Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other . 1.557068404753731
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 2.154434690031884
Is not general incivility the very <UNK> of love ? " " Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . 2.1017480113324885
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a <UNK> space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . 1.3768571648527583
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . 4.641588833612778
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . 1.9684194472866121
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . 3.8746751204561316
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 1.2990813969063477
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . 1.6496480740980204
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 1.5848931924611136
I will read it to you " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles <UNK> to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <UNK> <UNK> . 1.2775649214671148
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 1.2775649214671148
Bennet could hardly comprehend it . 17.78279410038923
Mr . Collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . 4.216965034285822
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time . 2.8480358684358014
How is half such a sum to be repaid ? " Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . 1.8632463119315603
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned . 1.2195704601594413
Hurst ' s gown " Here she was interrupted again . 5.878016072274914
But I am at his disposal . 12.915496650148839
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy . 8.11130830789687
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this <UNK> recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy ! 1.4412195967188537
Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " This walk is not wide enough for our party . 2.7213387683753076
<UNK> , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . " " And do you <UNK> it to either of those ? " " Yes ; to the last . 1.6876124757881477
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 1.6876124757881477
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 1.557068404753731
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? " " I think she will . 1.9684194472866121
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more <UNK> , and less <UNK> than the other had ever seen him . 1.7534865500829584
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . 3.359818286283782
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " " You may as well call it impertinence at once . 1.8329807108324359
He <UNK> , and <UNK> , and makes love to us all . 4.641588833612778
CHAPTER VIII . 100.00000000000004
c . " Mr . Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . 1.93069772888325
I fancy she was wanted about the <UNK> <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 1.5998587196060583
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 1.7534865500829584
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or <UNK> reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . 1.3111339374215643
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . 2.346228848142263
But no such recollection <UNK> her . 12.915496650148839
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . 4.216965034285822
And one of my own daughters . 12.915496650148839
She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband . 6.812920690579612
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . 2.346228848142263
CHAPTER V . 100.00000000000004
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 1.557068404753731
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them . " This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret . 1.3485595530525598
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " " You have . 1.5441135899948315
Lady Catherine de Bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . 2.7213387683753076
You deserve no such attention . 17.78279410038923
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley . 2.7213387683753076
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . 2.51188643150958
" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 2.0092330025650473
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 2.8480358684358014
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth <UNK> out the coffee , in so close a <UNK> , that there was not a single <UNK> near her , which would admit of a chair . 1.632172128563275
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 2.154434690031884
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . " Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . 1.8957356524063758
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . 3.359818286283782
Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 2.4244620170823286

It will save me a world of trouble and economy . 5.878016072274914
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s . 3.359818286283782
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . 3.8746751204561316
I promised them so <UNK> ! 17.78279410038923
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their <UNK> concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 2.346228848142263
He danced only four dances ! 17.78279410038923
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane . 1.93069772888325
You must therefore allow me to follow the <UNK> of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . 2.0092330025650473
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go . 6.812920690579612
I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . 1.41011239906908
What are men to <UNK> and mountains ? 10.000000000000002
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were <UNK> the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . 1.6681005372000588
" Oh , yes ! if one could but go to Brighton ! 4.641588833612778
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . 2.8480358684358014
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us . 4.641588833612778
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? 5.878016072274914
So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 2.346228848142263
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . 1.7301957388458942
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <UNK> , distance becomes no evil . 3.359818286283782
Her mind was less difficult to <UNK> . 10.000000000000002
" It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . 3.593813663804627
Again she read on . 26.82695795279726
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 2.51188643150958
" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . 3.359818286283782
They will never be distressed for money . 10.000000000000002
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so <UNK> ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and <UNK> , " Let me call your maid . 1.53174046370208
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 1.9684194472866121
" Are you not diverted ? " " Oh ! 6.812920690579612
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . 2.4244620170823286
These are <UNK> , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . 2.1017480113324885
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister ' s being in town . 2.7213387683753076
He studies too much for words of four <UNK> . Do not you , Darcy ? " " My style of writing is very different from yours . " " Oh ! " cried Miss Bingley , " Charles <UNK> in the most careless way imaginable . 1.5998587196060583
Lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . 1.9684194472866121
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to <UNK> these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 1.5848931924611136
But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! 2.154434690031884
" You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . 1.615598098439874
" I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth . 4.641588833612778
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long <UNK> . " Mrs . 1.93069772888325
" What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut . 2.8480358684358014
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . 3.593813663804627
Bennet give up the point . 17.78279410038923
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . 1.3830728955554412
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . 8.11130830789687
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . 4.641588833612778
Have you seen any pleasant men ? 12.915496650148839
Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . 3.8746751204561316
Lydia ' s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , <UNK> engaged with one of the <UNK> <UNK> in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little <UNK> , of his house and garden at Hunsford . 1.2401035305418566
Thank God ! 100.00000000000004
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took <UNK> in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 2.0535250264571463
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 2.0535250264571463
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 3.1622776601683795
" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . 1.8047217668271702
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . 1.8632463119315603
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as <UNK> of derivative works , <UNK> , <UNK> and research . 2.610157215682537
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 1.4677992676220695
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s <UNK> her coming so far alone . 1.9684194472866121
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? 3.8746751204561316
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 8.11130830789687
" Don ' t keep <UNK> so , Kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! 3.593813663804627
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would I do congratulate you but are you certain ? 3.1622776601683795
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . 2.8480358684358014
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 3.359818286283782
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 1.7082763938087104
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> . 3.593813663804627
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . 1.6681005372000588
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 10.000000000000002
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 1.3111339374215643
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he did I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Mr . Robinson . " " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? 1.4873521072935114
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <UNK> . " " And this is your real opinion ! 1.4330125702369627
I am so pleased so happy . 12.915496650148839
" Oh ! 100.00000000000004
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others . 1.8632463119315603
All Meryton seemed striving to <UNK> the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . 2.4244620170823286
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . 3.359818286283782
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library . " Mrs . 1.1987818459583777
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . 2.0535250264571463
Are the <UNK> of Pemberley to be thus <UNK> ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . 2.2758459260747883
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . 3.8746751204561316
It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . 1.7301957388458942
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 2.51188643150958
" Oh ! 100.00000000000004
but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley ' s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the <UNK> have no horses to theirs . " " I had much rather go in the coach . " " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure . 1.5085907086001784
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 3.8746751204561316
<UNK> Michael S . 46.415888336127786
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . 2.9935772947204895
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over <UNK> evils , or <UNK> them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . 2.1017480113324885
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it . 2.346228848142263
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 2.2122162910704493
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 2.2122162910704493
I knew how it would be . 12.915496650148839
have you heard from my uncle ? " " Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . " " Well , and what news does it bring ? 1.9684194472866121
" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . 5.878016072274914
You provide , in accordance with paragraph . F . , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and <UNK> to you within days of receipt of the work . 1.5998587196060583
" You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . 2.9935772947204895
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . 1.4977474763452014
CHAPTER XVI . 100.00000000000004
" The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . 2.2122162910704493
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth felt Jane ' s pleasure . 12.915496650148839
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 2.2758459260747883
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 2.2122162910704493
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane . 5.878016072274914
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some <UNK> , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings . 1.632172128563275
Bennet was <UNK> engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <UNK> them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather <UNK> than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . 1.3768571648527583
Mr . Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the <UNK> and go to sleep . 2.51188643150958
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him . 2.4244620170823286
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing room . 2.4244620170823286
Who would have thought it ! 17.78279410038923
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 1.8632463119315603
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . 3.1622776601683795
in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 2.51188643150958
But that is one great difference between us . 8.11130830789687
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . 2.0535250264571463
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ? 2.7213387683753076
I did for you . 26.82695795279726
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . 2.8480358684358014
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <UNK> society . " " But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . " " Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . 1.615598098439874
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe . 1.7534865500829584
Thank Heaven ! 100.00000000000004
Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and <UNK> its extent . 4.641588833612778
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . 1.4677992676220695
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 1.93069772888325
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 2.346228848142263
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . 2.0092330025650473
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . 2.346228848142263
When this was done , she had a less active part to play . 4.216965034285822
" No ; but it must be done soon . " Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . 2.2122162910704493
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . " " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . " " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " I am not . " Lady Catherine seemed pleased . 1.2648552168552962
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 1.5199110829529336
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . 8.11130830789687

If his own vanity , however , did not <UNK> him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . 1.8047217668271702
A lively imagination soon settled it all . 10.000000000000002
No , no , you shall not deceive me . 6.812920690579612
" With my mother up stairs . 12.915496650148839
<UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 2.4244620170823286
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . 6.812920690579612
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 1.8632463119315603
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . 1.5848931924611136
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s <UNK> . 2.51188643150958
Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by <UNK> to his sister . 1.8957356524063758
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 1.7082763938087104
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . 3.1622776601683795
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs . 2.4244620170823286
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 2.7213387683753076
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . 2.2758459260747883
Lady Catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . 2.9935772947204895
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . 2.9935772947204895
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . 3.8746751204561316
This information , however , startled Mrs . 10.000000000000002
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 1.3287913432286882
With the <UNK> concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 2.346228848142263
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . " Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative . 1.5441135899948315
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . 3.593813663804627
" And pray may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a <UNK> tone , " Is it in address that he improves ? 2.154434690031884
<UNK> as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . 2.8480358684358014
See paragraph . C below . 17.78279410038923
Mary was obliged to <UNK> more with the world , but she could still <UNK> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <UNK> between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <UNK> to the change without much <UNK> . 1.5085907086001784
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 1.3485595530525598
No , no , let me <UNK> for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret . 1.5848931924611136
Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . 3.8746751204561316
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . 2.4244620170823286
Though our kind uncle has done something towards <UNK> him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . 2.1017480113324885
Mr . and Mrs . 26.82695795279726
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her <UNK> , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . 1.5706464294715548
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 3.359818286283782
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 2.7213387683753076
I am not to be <UNK> into anything so wholly unreasonable . 5.179474679231212
" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! " said she . 4.641588833612778
is she handsome ? " " She is a most charming young lady indeed . 3.8746751204561316
I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 1.425102670302998
Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . 3.593813663804627
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? 2.0092330025650473
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her <UNK> spirits , and of teaching her that her present <UNK> are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 1.615598098439874
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . 1.4677992676220695
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 2.2122162910704493
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . 1.7534865500829584
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 1.4873521072935114
I know not what to think . 12.915496650148839
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . 6.812920690579612
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before . 1.53174046370208
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much . 5.179474679231212
The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood . 3.359818286283782
CHAPTER XIX . 100.00000000000004
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the <UNK> kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . 1.8957356524063758
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . 1.778279410038923
sir , I do indeed . 17.78279410038923
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund . 1.8957356524063758
What congratulations will then flow in ! 12.915496650148839
I shall now know how to act . 10.000000000000002
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . 5.878016072274914
how rich and how great you will be ! 8.11130830789687
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease . 2.1017480113324885
Good Heaven ! 100.00000000000004
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . <UNK> immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . " " What is his name ? " " Bingley . " " Is he married or single ? " " Oh ! 1.2505106035854068
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of <UNK> on Mr . Collins ' s side , and as many bows on Sir William ' s , they departed . 1.7301957388458942
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . 2.2122162910704493
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 2.610157215682537
Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . 1.8047217668271702
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 12.915496650148839
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you ! 3.8746751204561316
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . 1.7534865500829584
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 2.9935772947204895
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole <UNK> of <UNK> , as was here collected in one individual . 2.0535250264571463
nonsense , how can you talk so ! 10.000000000000002
Mr . Darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . 2.9935772947204895
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . 1.8329807108324359
He placed himself by her . 17.78279410038923
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you . 3.8746751204561316
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his <UNK> to myself . 1.9684194472866121
We passed each other several times . 12.915496650148839
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his <UNK> to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm . 1.6681005372000588
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of <UNK> in that way . 3.359818286283782
" Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . 1.557068404753731
Poor Jane ! 100.00000000000004
It is really too distressing . 17.78279410038923
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uncle Philips , <UNK> <UNK> wine , who followed them into the room . 1.3768571648527583
When the ladies were <UNK> for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> . 2.1017480113324885
CHAPTER XV . 100.00000000000004
do not repeat what I then said . 10.000000000000002
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? " " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . " " Oh ! 1.5998587196060583
Forster . 316.22776601683796
" But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . " Elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . 1.4677992676220695
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? 5.179474679231212
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <UNK> of elegant nuptials , fine <UNK> , new carriages , and servants . 1.5199110829529336
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 1.2560585988318853
" Oh ! 100.00000000000004
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . 2.610157215682537
Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . 3.593813663804627
" What do you think ? 17.78279410038923
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! 2.1017480113324885
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 2.2758459260747883
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 1.2843862635897427
Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 1.7301957388458942
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . 3.1622776601683795
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object . 4.216965034285822
Sir William did not say much . 12.915496650148839
" Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " I have , Sir . " " Very well . 2.4244620170823286
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . 5.179474679231212
He was angry . 46.415888336127786
You know I have . 26.82695795279726
If I were not afraid of judging <UNK> , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . 2.1017480113324885
At length however Mrs . 26.82695795279726
" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . 1.8632463119315603
" Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever <UNK> , that your resentment once created was <UNK> . 1.4497406703726319
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! 8.11130830789687
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . 4.641588833612778
She certainly did not hate him . 12.915496650148839
His apparent partiality had <UNK> , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . 2.8480358684358014
Mr . Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . 2.346228848142263
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ? 1.4773776525985112
I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . " Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . 1.5199110829529336
By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <UNK> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 1.8047217668271702
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " <UNK> you ! 3.359818286283782
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 2.51188643150958
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 1.353876180022544
I am glad he is gone . 12.915496650148839
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . 5.179474679231212
It cannot be concealed from any one . 10.000000000000002
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr . Bingley ? " " When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . 1.557068404753731
<UNK> may sometimes be purchased too dearly . 10.000000000000002
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 5.878016072274914
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 1.6496480740980204
are sufficiently known . 46.415888336127786
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her <UNK> being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 1.365007806546014
Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . 5.878016072274914
At length Darcy spoke , and in a <UNK> manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . " " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with <UNK> , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . " Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . 1.2809343786525484
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . " Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where Mrs . 1.2589254117941673
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 6.812920690579612
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . 2.0535250264571463
She is not such a simpleton . 12.915496650148839
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 2.0092330025650473
" But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not <UNK> his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . 1.7301957388458942
Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 2.1017480113324885
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 1.7301957388458942
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . 3.359818286283782
" I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . 2.51188643150958
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . 1.5441135899948315
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 1.41011239906908
The children have been wanting me this half hour . 6.812920690579612
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted <UNK> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <UNK> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . 1.8632463119315603
The dejection was almost universal . 17.78279410038923
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . 2.8480358684358014
There can be no occasion for your going so soon . 5.878016072274914
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible . 1.5848931924611136
You will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . " He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit <UNK> long . 1.4677992676220695
I am not at all afraid of her dying . 6.812920690579612
She will be taken good care of . 10.000000000000002
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was <UNK> for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . 1.353876180022544
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas . 1.632172128563275
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . 5.179474679231212
Bingley and talked of Mrs . 17.78279410038923
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 2.2758459260747883
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the <UNK> of his confidence in his friend . 2.0092330025650473
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . " From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . 1.7082763938087104
No thanks to his gallantry for that . 10.000000000000002
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and <UNK> study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . " And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his <UNK> she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . 1.302994338575022
His debts are to be paid , <UNK> , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased . 1.8329807108324359
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . 3.1622776601683795
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , Mrs . 3.359818286283782
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to <UNK> the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 2.0535250264571463
I have by no means done . 12.915496650148839
<UNK> Lady Catherine as well as you can . 8.11130830789687
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . 4.216965034285822
That his anger could be carried to such a point of <UNK> resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem <UNK> , exceeded all that she could believe possible . 1.7534865500829584
Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 6.812920690579612
" Oh ! 100.00000000000004
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 2.0092330025650473
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . " " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . 1.4677992676220695
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . 1.7534865500829584
She is unfortunately of a sickly <UNK> , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who <UNK> her education , and who still <UNK> with them . 1.5998587196060583
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . 3.593813663804627
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs . 3.593813663804627
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
Let her go then . 26.82695795279726
Mr . Bennet ' s <UNK> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! 1.3894954943731377
" What can be the meaning of this ! " said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone . 2.8480358684358014
His attachment to Rosings , certainly <UNK> . " Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 1.8632463119315603
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 2.1017480113324885
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 3.1622776601683795
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , <UNK> painful to me . 1.8047217668271702
Adieu . 316.22776601683796
" Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? 2.4244620170823286
It was gratitude . <UNK> , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <UNK> and <UNK> of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 1.632172128563275
Not these two or three years perhaps . " " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can . 2.2122162910704493
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . 2.1017480113324885
He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 1.5706464294715548
The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who <UNK> it , were familiar to them . 2.346228848142263
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . 2.8480358684358014
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . 1.9684194472866121
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is <UNK> . " " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
It was over at last however . 12.915496650148839
CHAPTER VII . 100.00000000000004
" I am , dear Sir , c . 8.11130830789687
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . " Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . 1.5998587196060583
Your ' s , c . " Mr . Darcy ' s letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last . 1.615598098439874
I am going away myself . " " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . " And upon Elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr . Collins . " Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . 1.2115276586285884
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 1.4412195967188537
You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not . 4.641588833612778
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . 3.593813663804627
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . " " I would wish not to be hasty in <UNK> any one ; but I always speak what I think . " " I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder . 1.53174046370208
An union of a different tendency , and <UNK> the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . 2.4244620170823286
Yes , I call it a very easy distance . " " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth . 1.9684194472866121
" They have both , " said she , " been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . 2.0092330025650473
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? 5.179474679231212
Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her . 2.4244620170823286
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 4.641588833612778
" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
good or bad ? " " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . 1.632172128563275
But you have chosen your fault well . I really cannot laugh at it . 3.8746751204561316
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away . 2.7213387683753076
Bennet could hardly contain herself . 17.78279410038923
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s . 3.593813663804627
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 1.93069772888325
Be so kind as to <UNK> for us to Miss Darcy . 5.179474679231212
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <UNK> your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter . 1.632172128563275
CHAPTER I . 100.00000000000004
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . 1.9684194472866121
" He only told me , what I have now told you . " Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart <UNK> with indignation . 2.1017480113324885
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 2.4244620170823286
<UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . 5.878016072274914
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . 1.615598098439874
It was then <UNK> in the following manner . 8.11130830789687
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 2.2758459260747883
Lydia , my love , ring the bell . 8.11130830789687
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <UNK> , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the <UNK> way for happiness . 1.3593563908785256
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
<UNK> them next to your great uncle the judge . 6.812920690579612
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she <UNK> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . " Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . 1.365007806546014
Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the <UNK> and smiles of the whole party . 1.7301957388458942
Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master . 3.1622776601683795
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . 3.593813663804627
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention . 2.2758459260747883
Do not let us quarrel about the past . 8.11130830789687
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little <UNK> by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . 1.5085907086001784
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . 2.8480358684358014
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . 3.593813663804627
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the per <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477
<UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill . 8.11130830789687
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . 1.425102670302998
A clergyman like you must marry . <UNK> properly , chuse a <UNK> for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . 1.557068404753731
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . 3.1622776601683795
He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . 3.1622776601683795
" She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . " Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . 1.295267744355328
" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . 3.8746751204561316
And then we were so merry all the way home ! 5.878016072274914
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else ! 3.359818286283782
But Mrs . 100.00000000000004
What <UNK> money , what <UNK> , what carriages you will have ! 4.641588833612778
GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 1.9684194472866121
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . 2.610157215682537
There is nothing he would not do for her . " The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . 1.93069772888325
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 1.3070104796093682
How he lived I know not . 12.915496650148839
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . 1.333521432163324
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . 2.2122162910704493
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . " Elizabeth could not <UNK> a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . 1.3768571648527583
Mr . Wickham ' s chief object was <UNK> my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of <UNK> himself on me , was a strong inducement . 1.7301957388458942
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 5.179474679231212
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . 3.8746751204561316
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . 4.216965034285822
Brighton , and a whole <UNK> of <UNK> , to us , who have been <UNK> already by one poor regiment of militia , and the <UNK> balls of Meryton . " " Now I have got some news for you , " said Lydia , as they sat down to table . 1.5199110829529336
Darcy may be guessed . 26.82695795279726
My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . 1.5441135899948315
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . 2.154434690031884
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . 3.359818286283782
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <UNK> , readily obeyed . 2.7213387683753076
" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 2.154434690031884
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham . 8.11130830789687
I rather wonder now at your knowing any . " " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " I never saw such a woman . 1.778279410038923
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been <UNK> from the world , in some distant farm house . 1.6876124757881477
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . 5.878016072274914
The discussion of Mr . Collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . 1.7301957388458942
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s . 2.610157215682537
Her affections had been continually <UNK> , but never without an object . 4.641588833612778
" Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our <UNK> way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . " Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and <UNK> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 1.3830728955554412
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . 5.179474679231212
This was very amiable , but Charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . 1.615598098439874
The moral will be perfectly fair . 12.915496650148839
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 4.641588833612778
My feelings in every respect forbid it . 10.000000000000002
Other schemes too came into her head . 10.000000000000002
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . 1.615598098439874
" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . 2.7213387683753076
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 1.9684194472866121
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 1.28792362543363
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 8.11130830789687
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to <UNK> his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be <UNK> <UNK> . 1.3433993325989002
He was very fond of them . " This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham ' s being among them . 2.610157215682537
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however <UNK> its existence might prove , had at least <UNK> one day . 1.3111339374215643
" <UNK> it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . " " Gracechurch street , Monday , <UNK> . 2.0535250264571463
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . 2.9935772947204895
A house in town ! 26.82695795279726
I never saw such <UNK> , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " Mrs . 2.4244620170823286
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
And do you really love him quite well enough ? 6.812920690579612
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year . 2.154434690031884
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 1.396135390856794
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 2.7213387683753076
And , besides , no <UNK> of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then supposing them to be in London . 2.1017480113324885
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <UNK> what <UNK> felicity really was . 3.359818286283782
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . " " Very true ; and if I had my will , we should . 2.1017480113324885
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs . 5.878016072274914
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley is not he ? 3.8746751204561316
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . 1.6876124757881477
She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . 1.7534865500829584
It is impossible that he should still love me . " After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on <UNK> their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water <UNK> , there <UNK> to be a little alteration . 1.4412195967188537
She comes to us to day . 12.915496650148839
Her cousin <UNK> his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the <UNK> of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . " It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . 1.3894954943731377
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . 1.7301957388458942
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been <UNK> by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 1.7534865500829584
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . 1.8047217668271702
He is come Mr . Bingley is come . He is , indeed . 4.216965034285822
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 1.41011239906908
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <UNK> . 3.593813663804627
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 3.1622776601683795
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 2.2758459260747883
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 1.5998587196060583
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . 5.179474679231212
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and <UNK> mercenary ; and the <UNK> of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to <UNK> at any thing . 1.7301957388458942
Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
<UNK> those who are at all his <UNK> in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . 2.2758459260747883
His character was to speak for itself . 10.000000000000002
" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! 1.4497406703726319
and his sisters are charming women . 12.915496650148839
<UNK> to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax <UNK> to the full extent permitted by U . S . federal laws and your state ' s laws . 2.0535250264571463
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring . 5.179474679231212
How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . 2.2122162910704493
I am sure my sisters must all envy me . 6.812920690579612
She directly replied , " You need not be frightened . 5.878016072274914
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . 2.346228848142263
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ' s way . " Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <UNK> . 1.5706464294715548
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
and what can he have to say ? " " Something very much to the purpose of course . 2.9935772947204895
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 1.4873521072935114
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my <UNK> . " " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . 2.0535250264571463
I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 1.8329807108324359
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 1.8632463119315603
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 5.878016072274914
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 5.878016072274914
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? 5.878016072274914
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . 3.8746751204561316
I am prodigiously proud of him . 12.915496650148839
" Did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ? 2.9935772947204895
" Oh , Jane , take care . " " My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . " " I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . " They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs . 1.4174741629268053
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? 1.5441135899948315
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . 2.51188643150958
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? 4.641588833612778
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 3.359818286283782
If she does not object to it , why should we ? " " Her not objecting , does not justify him . 2.51188643150958
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 10.000000000000002
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw . 2.0535250264571463
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 2.0535250264571463
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . 1.4873521072935114
She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . 1.7301957388458942
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <UNK> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . 1.4873521072935114
Most people start at our Web site which has the <UNK> <UNK> search <UNK> www . gutenberg . org This Web site <UNK> information about Project Gutenberg tm , including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation , how to help produce our new eBooks , and how to <UNK> to our <UNK> <UNK> to hear about new eBooks . 1.4174741629268053
In <UNK> lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <UNK> in this interference . 2.1017480113324885
I wonder what he can be doing there . " " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth . 2.346228848142263
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a <UNK> situation , and always spending more than they ought . 2.51188643150958
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . " " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . 1.3894954943731377
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 2.2758459260747883
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . 3.8746751204561316
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . 1.557068404753731
By you , I was properly humbled . 10.000000000000002
You thought me then <UNK> of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . 3.593813663804627
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . 8.11130830789687
Make haste , make haste . 17.78279410038923
They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . 2.346228848142263
She performed her part indeed without much <UNK> , but Mrs . 5.179474679231212
The business was therefore soon settled . 12.915496650148839
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . " " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? " " Indeed I had . 1.8632463119315603
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely . 2.2122162910704493
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all <UNK> , if she <UNK> more , and could have the advantage of a London master . 1.6876124757881477
Collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too . 1.8047217668271702
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . " " Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . 1.5441135899948315
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which were scattered over the <UNK> lawn . 1.8047217668271702
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . 3.359818286283782
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . 1.4585940117250362
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . " " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 1.4977474763452014
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 5.179474679231212
A great deal more passed at the other table . 6.812920690579612
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 8.11130830789687
<UNK> was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth " My dearest Lizzy , " I <UNK> myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . 1.632172128563275
She would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house . " Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer . 1.7301957388458942
" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . 2.4244620170823286
We dressed up <UNK> in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! 2.51188643150958
I have no pleasure in talking to <UNK> children . Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body . 2.51188643150958
Of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was <UNK> with admiration was evident enough . 2.346228848142263
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . 2.8480358684358014
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . " Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . 1.4330125702369627
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 1.4585940117250362
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <UNK> , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 1.4174741629268053
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 1.4677992676220695
<UNK> as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . 2.7213387683753076
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . 8.11130830789687
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . " <UNK> ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 1.9684194472866121
CHAPTER XVII . 100.00000000000004
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . 2.0535250264571463
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <UNK> . 1.8632463119315603
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 2.1017480113324885
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 2.346228848142263
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . 2.4244620170823286
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas ' s last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the <UNK> were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three <UNK> <UNK> at least . 1.615598098439874
<UNK> to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . 1.778279410038923
Bennet was <UNK> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and <UNK> in her <UNK> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the <UNK> happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 1.3593563908785256
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 1.3593563908785256
To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough . 3.593813663804627
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . " " Oh ! 1.8047217668271702
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 3.359818286283782
She studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . 3.593813663804627
how acutely did she now feel it . 10.000000000000002
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " Elizabeth could not but look surprised . 1.6496480740980204
Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane ' s ? 2.9935772947204895
<UNK> these efforts , Project Gutenberg tm electronic works , and the medium on which they may be <UNK> , may contain " <UNK> , " such as , but not limited to , <UNK> , <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> errors , a copyright or other intellectual property <UNK> , a defective or <UNK> <UNK> or other medium , a computer <UNK> , or computer <UNK> that <UNK> or cannot be read by your equipment . 1.333521432163324
Lizzy <UNK> she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . " " And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems an hopeless business . " " <UNK> to Lizzy about it yourself . 1.5441135899948315
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . 1.6876124757881477
Not like the wild young men now a days , who think of nothing but themselves . 3.359818286283782
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . 2.2758459260747883
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . 6.812920690579612
She represented to him all the <UNK> of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . 2.0535250264571463
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have <UNK> either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . 1.5998587196060583
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare <UNK> to listen to . 1.778279410038923
London Printed for T . 26.82695795279726
She turned from sister to sister , <UNK> their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . 1.5085907086001784
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <UNK> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 1.4497406703726319
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 1.28792362543363
Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 1.2618568830660204
" Yours , c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a <UNK> fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . " " Oh ! 1.3768571648527583
Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . 1.9684194472866121
He is so excessively handsome ! 17.78279410038923
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 2.2758459260747883
" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <UNK> , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss <UNK> ' s . " " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . " " Oh ! 1.3287913432286882
The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . 3.1622776601683795
It is unaccountable ! 46.415888336127786
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . 2.0535250264571463
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . 2.2758459260747883
At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s <UNK> him entirely , for she was a most determined <UNK> ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making <UNK> and exclaiming after <UNK> , to have attention for any one in particular . 1.4585940117250362
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 1.2352165993694857
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so <UNK> with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and <UNK> of her own family ! 1.6876124757881477
Section . 316.22776601683796
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . 2.0535250264571463
They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . 4.216965034285822
Bingley was the principal <UNK> , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away . 1.9684194472866121
But , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . 2.610157215682537
" I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel <UNK> ' s regiment went away . 2.346228848142263
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . 1.557068404753731
Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , <UNK> exclaimed , " Good Lord ! 2.0092330025650473
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of inviting him . " " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . 1.615598098439874
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . 2.346228848142263
" And this is always the way with him , " she added . " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . 1.9684194472866121
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " There can be no doubt of that . 2.346228848142263
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . 4.641588833612778
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 1.2451970847350329
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . 4.641588833612778
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy . 2.8480358684358014
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . 1.4412195967188537
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 2.1017480113324885
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! 3.359818286283782
" Your ' s , c . " This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be <UNK> , by the sister at least . 1.8329807108324359
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . " " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . 1.7082763938087104
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " CHAPTER XVIII . 3.1622776601683795
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . 1.8632463119315603
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . 2.2122162910704493
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . 2.2122162910704493
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 1.557068404753731
Our poor mother is sadly grieved . 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> . 1.302994338575022
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <UNK> , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her <UNK> and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , Lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . 1.4330125702369627
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him . 3.8746751204561316
CHAPTER II . 100.00000000000004
I was ready to die of laughter . 10.000000000000002
" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . " " You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . 2.2758459260747883
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 1.778279410038923
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . 17.78279410038923
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 1.3433993325989002
Its banks were neither formal , nor <UNK> adorned . 6.812920690579612
Her hair so <UNK> , so <UNK> ! " " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six <UNK> deep in <UNK> , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . " " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . 1.3485595530525598
A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . 4.216965034285822
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . 1.6496480740980204
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . 3.1622776601683795
But these things happen so often ! 12.915496650148839
What is your own opinion ? " " That it ought not to be attempted . 3.593813663804627
The first week of their return was soon gone . 6.812920690579612
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . 4.641588833612778
It will not do . 26.82695795279726
CHAPTER III . 100.00000000000004

It originated in Mrs . 26.82695795279726
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . 1.4873521072935114
This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham . 1.615598098439874
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? 5.878016072274914
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as , by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . 1.4497406703726319
" Can you come to morrow ? " Yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 2.154434690031884

It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy . 1.7534865500829584
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 2.9935772947204895
If he fears me , why come hither ? 8.11130830789687
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . 3.593813663804627
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , <UNK> my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " " It is well . 1.6681005372000588
I thought we never should have got into the coach . 5.878016072274914
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 1.615598098439874
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 1.7534865500829584
If your feelings are still what they were last <UNK> , tell me so at once . 3.359818286283782
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 2.2758459260747883

To Mrs . 100.00000000000004
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 1.7301957388458942
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . " " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us . 1.3894954943731377
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 1.557068404753731
It <UNK> me , I confess ; for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . 2.7213387683753076
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . " Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <UNK> at the <UNK> of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time <UNK> her natural degree of sense , since the <UNK> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be <UNK> , was likely to be <UNK> in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a <UNK> place and a camp . 1.2478254704700218
Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 2.2122162910704493
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 1.4873521072935114
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty <UNK> , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . 1.8329807108324359
She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs . 8.11130830789687
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 2.9935772947204895
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 1.7082763938087104
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . 1.8329807108324359

But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to <UNK> you when your father is dead . I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day .

" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the <UNK> that is laid on them , as nonsense ? 2.7213387683753076
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 1.8047217668271702
I am so happy . 26.82695795279726

He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child . 2.2758459260747883
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most <UNK> character ! 2.610157215682537
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all <UNK> , was still <UNK> <UNK> . 2.346228848142263
No , no I feel he may defy us there . 5.878016072274914
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! 4.216965034285822
And then when we came away it was such fun ! 5.878016072274914
The letter was to this effect " MY DEAR <UNK> , " I wish you joy . 3.359818286283782
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . 2.0092330025650473
It was really a very handsome thought . 10.000000000000002
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . 3.593813663804627
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 5.878016072274914
<UNK> as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . 2.2122162910704493
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . 5.878016072274914
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united <UNK> . 2.2122162910704493
It adds even another motive . 17.78279410038923
Kitty and Lydia were far from <UNK> Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . 1.778279410038923
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one <UNK> of perfect <UNK> in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his <UNK> that her manners were not those of the <UNK> world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . 1.4773776525985112
She saw with the <UNK> eye of fancy , the <UNK> of that gay bathing place covered with officers . 2.8480358684358014
I shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will <UNK> and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " Elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 1.1830216722875087
How are they even to be discovered ? 10.000000000000002
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . 1.2843862635897427
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 3.8746751204561316
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern <UNK> , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . 1.2175031274276027

Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <UNK> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . 1.2679227183627855
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . 4.216965034285822
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 2.0092330025650473
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 1.8957356524063758

She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 2.51188643150958
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . 2.0092330025650473
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . 1.6876124757881477
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . 5.878016072274914
" She is my youngest girl but one . 8.11130830789687
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would <UNK> you about to all the balls . 2.4244620170823286
They must be a great loss to your family . " In Darcy ' s presence she dared not mention Wickham ' s name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <UNK> in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , <UNK> herself <UNK> to <UNK> the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . 1.3485595530525598
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . 5.179474679231212
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . " Mrs . 3.1622776601683795
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . " " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . " " I beg your pardon . 1.9684194472866121
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 1.6876124757881477
Lady Catherine ' s great attentions to Mrs . 8.11130830789687
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . 1.778279410038923
Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority . 2.0092330025650473
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford . 10.000000000000002
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . 1.5848931924611136
<UNK> sons cannot marry where they like . " " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . " " Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . " " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl ' s younger son ? 1.2328467394420661
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . 1.4977474763452014
They all <UNK> tables , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . 1.778279410038923
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . 1.2775649214671148
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 1.3894954943731377
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and <UNK> , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <UNK> her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . 1.353876180022544
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London . 3.8746751204561316
But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my <UNK> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . 1.5848931924611136
" And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . 2.7213387683753076
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two . 2.0092330025650473
" While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr . Bingley . " " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife . 1.8329807108324359
" He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived . 2.7213387683753076
Gardiner , rendered <UNK> by Elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . 3.1622776601683795
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a <UNK> as that , it might be of essential consequence . 2.0535250264571463
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , <UNK> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . 1.5085907086001784
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 1.8047217668271702
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as <UNK> <UNK> as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . 1.5998587196060583
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . 3.8746751204561316
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character . 2.154434690031884
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be <UNK> to her nieces . 2.2122162910704493
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! 1.5441135899948315

You are lucky in having such a master . " " Yes , Sir , I know I am . 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better <UNK> room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . 1.3287913432286882
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . 1.2915496650148839
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 4.641588833612778
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " <UNK> in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . 1.5085907086001784
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 1.425102670302998
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , <UNK> , absurd . 2.0535250264571463
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 1.3593563908785256
Well ! 316.22776601683796
Collins was settled near her family . " " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . 8.11130830789687
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 1.4873521072935114
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 1.93069772888325
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her . 6.812920690579612
CHAPTER XII . 100.00000000000004
Collins knew not what to make of him . 8.11130830789687
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 1.4497406703726319
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an <UNK> man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a <UNK> , had nothing to say to her . 1.4030037231905736
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . 3.8746751204561316
He knows where we live . 17.78279410038923
Well , how pleased I am ! 12.915496650148839
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 2.4244620170823286
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 1.8329807108324359
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . 1.3287913432286882
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . 1.2096079377043663

Yours ever , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " With the officers ! " cried Lydia . 3.359818286283782
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . 12.915496650148839
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? " " Oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all . 2.0535250264571463
" I did not know that you intended to walk , " said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . 2.2758459260747883
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . 4.641588833612778
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . 5.878016072274914
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , <UNK> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 2.2758459260747883
<UNK> was the least of her feelings on this developement . 5.878016072274914
CHAPTER II . 100.00000000000004
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . 1.4330125702369627
Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . 2.0535250264571463
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . 2.9935772947204895
What am I to do ? " " Nothing child , nothing . 4.641588833612778
And now here ' s Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 1.7301957388458942
She had got rid of two of the <UNK> which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . 1.778279410038923
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . 2.7213387683753076
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . " " Oh ! " said Lydia <UNK> , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , I ' <UNK> the <UNK> . " The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . 1.2990813969063477
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph . 3.359818286283782
But here , by carrying with me one <UNK> source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <UNK> . 1.9684194472866121
The loo table , however , did not appear . 6.812920690579612
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . 2.2122162910704493
A thousand things may arise in six months ! " The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . 2.4244620170823286
His sense of her inferiority of its being a <UNK> of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . 1.5998587196060583
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose <UNK> of <UNK> support . 2.7213387683753076
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . 3.593813663804627
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
The path just admitted three . 17.78279410038923
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " My eldest sister has been in town these three months . 2.0535250264571463
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . 2.1017480113324885
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 2.8480358684358014
Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! 2.0092330025650473
Had his character been known , this could not have happened . 5.179474679231212
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . 1.2478254704700218
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 2.4244620170823286
Let me do it without farther loss of time . 6.812920690579612
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B . 5.878016072274914
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . 2.1017480113324885
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church . 2.346228848142263
You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her <UNK> , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . 1.6681005372000588
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does . 10.000000000000002
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent <UNK> of <UNK> on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . 1.615598098439874
She is quite a little creature . 12.915496650148839
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 1.5848931924611136
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , <UNK> Lucases . 1.9684194472866121
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I cannot blame myself for having done thus much . 1.93069772888325
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " " And they must marry ! 3.359818286283782
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . 2.0092330025650473
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a <UNK> . 1.365007806546014
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . 2.4244620170823286
How I long to see her ! 12.915496650148839
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 1.5706464294715548
Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . " " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK> accordingly . " " You did ! 1.3433993325989002
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 2.9935772947204895
I knew that Mr . Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . 4.641588833612778
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the <UNK> of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . 1.8329807108324359
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . " " Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> . 1.557068404753731
Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its <UNK> , to think of any thing else . 1.4873521072935114
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of <UNK> , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 1.53174046370208
The <UNK> would be spoilt by <UNK> a fourth . 6.812920690579612
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . 1.6681005372000588
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 4.641588833612778
She <UNK> Miss <UNK> a treasure . 12.915496650148839
It was only said , ' <UNK> , George Wickham , <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
We must not all expect Jane ' s good fortune . " " True , " said Mr . Bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may <UNK> you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . " Mr . Wickham ' s society was of material service in <UNK> the gloom , which the late <UNK> occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family . 1.3111339374215643
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . 1.4585940117250362
Let Wickham be your man . 17.78279410038923
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 3.593813663804627
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . 1.93069772888325
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth now began to <UNK> . 17.78279410038923
One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! 2.610157215682537
You see on what a footing we are . 8.11130830789687
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid . 1.8047217668271702
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 2.0535250264571463
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 1.8329807108324359
For , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken <UNK> , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the <UNK> reproof . 2.154434690031884
<UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
Jane was distressed . 46.415888336127786
Good gracious ! 100.00000000000004
His reception however was of the most flattering kind . 6.812920690579612
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned . 1.4677992676220695
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . 3.359818286283782
It was very little less . 17.78279410038923
what has she to do with it ? 10.000000000000002
" Gracechurch street , <UNK> . 17.78279410038923
" Lizzy , you must not do so . 8.11130830789687
and to see dear Wickham too ! 12.915496650148839
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . 2.4244620170823286
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 2.0535250264571463
Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar . 1.7301957388458942
If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 1.8632463119315603
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? " " Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . 2.0535250264571463
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
But on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . 1.8047217668271702
With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . 1.8632463119315603
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . 3.1622776601683795
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . 1.7082763938087104
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before . 2.0535250264571463
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only <UNK> off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . " When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . 1.4174741629268053
that he had <UNK> his <UNK> in the first dance ! " " Oh ! 3.8746751204561316
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . 2.4244620170823286
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . 3.1622776601683795
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative . 2.1017480113324885
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . 2.9935772947204895
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! 2.51188643150958
You must learn some of my philosophy . 10.000000000000002
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 4.216965034285822
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 2.610157215682537
He replied , and was again silent . 10.000000000000002
CHAPTER IV . 100.00000000000004
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 1.324192791886045
Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . 3.593813663804627
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . 3.593813663804627
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . " " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . " " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . 1.4497406703726319
" You may well warn me against such an evil . 5.878016072274914
how shall I bear so much happiness ! " She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty . 1.8957356524063758
Those who do not complain are never pitied . " Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or <UNK> her would only increase the irritation . 1.8632463119315603
. 2154.4346900318833
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . 1.333521432163324
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 1.19708503049573
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 2.0535250264571463
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the <UNK> curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two <UNK> of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . The envelope itself was likewise full . <UNK> her way along the lane , she then began it . 1.425102670302998
Long will do any such thing . 12.915496650148839
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of <UNK> , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than <UNK> anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 1.5199110829529336
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 3.8746751204561316
A younger son , you know , must be <UNK> to self denial and dependence . " " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either . 1.8632463119315603
. 2154.4346900318833
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 1.3768571648527583
He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . " " Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . " He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . 1.1389303737044376
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . 2.2758459260747883
I knew you would be wishing me joy . " " Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . 2.0535250264571463
Philips were now <UNK> of the most interesting intelligence . 6.812920690579612
My father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . 1.615598098439874
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter . 1.8329807108324359
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . 1.4585940117250362
The officers will find women better worth their notice . 6.812920690579612
It would be such a <UNK> scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . 2.8480358684358014
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? 8.11130830789687
CHAPTER IX . 100.00000000000004
They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . 1.4174741629268053
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . 1.4412195967188537
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 1.2451970847350329
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 1.365007806546014
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character . 2.9935772947204895
The <UNK> letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 1.8957356524063758
<UNK> as she was to admit an idea so <UNK> of Jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the <UNK> of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . 1.8957356524063758
CHAPTER VI . 100.00000000000004
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 2.154434690031884
" I see what you are feeling , " replied Charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to marry you . 1.8957356524063758
Hurst and Miss Bingley . 26.82695795279726
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 1.8329807108324359
" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . 2.346228848142263
Elizabeth was <UNK> enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 2.610157215682537
Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . 10.000000000000002
" Of a fine , stout , <UNK> love it may . 5.179474679231212
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months . 1.4330125702369627
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of <UNK> , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . 1.2990813969063477
" But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with <UNK> , and rob it of a few <UNK> <UNK> without his perceiving me . " The period of expectation was now <UNK> . 1.7534865500829584
You are safe from me . " " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . " " And your defect is a <UNK> to hate every body . " " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . " " Do let us have a little music , " cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . " Louisa , you will not mind my <UNK> Mr . Hurst . " Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . 1.1773944540970325

I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . " Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . 1.4174741629268053
Yet he knew to the contrary himself . 10.000000000000002
I wonder who first discovered the <UNK> of poetry in driving away love ! " " I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy . 1.93069772888325
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . 5.878016072274914
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 1.8957356524063758
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do ! 4.216965034285822
Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c . 2.2758459260747883
Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and <UNK> her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family . 1.778279410038923
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 2.9935772947204895
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . 2.7213387683753076
He was the <UNK> , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . 2.4244620170823286
that abominable Mr . Darcy ! My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to <UNK> it . 2.154434690031884
Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . 3.1622776601683795
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? " " Nearly three weeks . " " And you saw him frequently ? " " Yes , almost every day . " " His manners are very different from his cousin ' s . " " Yes , very different . 1.4174741629268053
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . " This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . 1.425102670302998
it is just as he <UNK> . 12.915496650148839
" Do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; " that is rather singular . " " Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " <UNK> cards . 1.93069772888325
Her ladyship was highly incensed . 17.78279410038923
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . " " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . " " In <UNK> your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were <UNK> . 1.2618568830660204
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation . 2.8480358684358014
This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better . 1.5848931924611136
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . 2.2758459260747883
" It certainly is a most <UNK> affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . 2.0535250264571463
At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . 2.9935772947204895
Here , <UNK> , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . 2.9935772947204895
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self importance and humility . 1.338388753173757
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . 3.359818286283782
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . 2.8480358684358014
They were natural and just . 17.78279410038923
" Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy . 3.593813663804627
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 3.593813663804627
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 1.6681005372000588
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 1.41011239906908
Not handsome enough to dance with ! 12.915496650148839
what does he say ? 26.82695795279726
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the coachman ' s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs . 1.3485595530525598
Gardiner ' s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are <UNK> against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 1.3894954943731377
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , glancing at her sister and Bingley , shall take place . 1.5441135899948315
Elizabeth immediately <UNK> the livery , guessed what it meant , and <UNK> no small degree of surprise to her relations , by <UNK> them with the honour which she expected . 1.9684194472866121
I dare say the <UNK> upon Mrs . 10.000000000000002
CHAPTER XVI . 100.00000000000004
Bennet ' s <UNK> looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . 3.1622776601683795
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . 3.8746751204561316
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 1.5441135899948315
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 2.9935772947204895
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest <UNK> , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any <UNK> display of regard , or any <UNK> of manner , where their two <UNK> only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 1.3708385261355818
yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . 2.8480358684358014
Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? 2.4244620170823286
Bennet , was not so well pleased with it . 6.812920690579612
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . 5.878016072274914
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 4.216965034285822
Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . 2.9935772947204895
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 1.1708281368909708
" I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . " " Not at all , " he replied ; " they were <UNK> by the exercise . " A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . 1.4330125702369627
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 4.641588833612778
Bennet , " to walk to <UNK> Mount this morning . 5.878016072274914
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 2.2122162910704493
Elizabeth was delighted . 46.415888336127786
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 1.6876124757881477
They must all go to Brighton . 12.915496650148839
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . " Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . 1.2305240043592616
Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 2.1017480113324885
Why does she not come in ? " " Oh ! 5.878016072274914
Miss Bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . 4.216965034285822
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 2.7213387683753076
And she was only sixteen last June . 10.000000000000002
But what is that to me ? 12.915496650148839
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . 4.216965034285822
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . 1.4677992676220695
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 2.4244620170823286
Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her <UNK> and <UNK> , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with Miss Bennet . 2.2758459260747883
If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession . 1.8632463119315603
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . 4.641588833612778
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 6.812920690579612
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s t te t te with Mrs . 2.2758459260747883
Bennet said only , " <UNK> , nonsense ! " " What can be the meaning of that <UNK> exclamation ? " cried he . 2.346228848142263
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . 2.51188643150958
" I found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr . Darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . " She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . 1.213482767749144
But it is so strange ! " " Yes that is what makes it amusing . 3.593813663804627
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . " They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . 1.3153690504363762
I told Mrs . 46.415888336127786
But make a virtue of it by all means . 6.812920690579612
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 2.154434690031884
<UNK> inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in <UNK> ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the <UNK> Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . 1.4677992676220695
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 3.593813663804627
Gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the <UNK> fashions . 2.9935772947204895
I will not tell you what it is . 8.11130830789687
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . 8.11130830789687
<UNK> , wretched , mistake ! " Darcy made no answer . 5.179474679231212
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <UNK> by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . 1.557068404753731
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 2.51188643150958
Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
On both sides it was only assertion . 10.000000000000002
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 1.7534865500829584
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 1.53174046370208
One seems so <UNK> without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth . 2.2122162910704493
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 1.93069772888325
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 1.5998587196060583
But self , though it would intrude , could not <UNK> her . 4.641588833612778
Mr . Bennet accepted the <UNK> , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . 2.51188643150958
What do I not owe you ! 12.915496650148839
" Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . 1.7534865500829584
What shall we do with him ? 12.915496650148839
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . 2.2122162910704493
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . 3.1622776601683795
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . 4.641588833612778
Mr . what ' s his name . 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . " " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . " " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " I honour your circumspection . 1.295267744355328
If the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the <UNK> . 2.51188643150958
They are destined for each other by the voice of every <UNK> of their <UNK> houses ; and what is to divide them ? 2.4244620170823286
But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . 1.7082763938087104
Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 1.8957356524063758
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . 2.4244620170823286
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . 4.216965034285822
She is grown so <UNK> and <UNK> ! 10.000000000000002
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Her ladyship ' s carriage is <UNK> ordered for us . 5.878016072274914
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . 2.8480358684358014
<UNK> such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 2.8480358684358014
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears <UNK> the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the <UNK> . 1.9684194472866121
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother . 4.216965034285822
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . " Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire . 1.242623671911505
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . 2.8480358684358014
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . 1.3768571648527583
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due . " " My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . 1.295267744355328
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 1.7082763938087104
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 2.2758459260747883
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and <UNK> of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their <UNK> . 1.396135390856794
By tea time however the <UNK> had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . 1.6681005372000588
" Oh ! 100.00000000000004
But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 1.4773776525985112
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 2.9935772947204895
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies . 4.216965034285822
<UNK> an only son , for many years an only child I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , my father particularly , all that was <UNK> and amiable , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and <UNK> , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . 1.302994338575022
Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . 2.2758459260747883
He can be a <UNK> companion if he thinks it worth his while . 4.216965034285822
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . 1.778279410038923
who could have done less for her ? 10.000000000000002
In Three Volumes . 46.415888336127786
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 1.5441135899948315
why did she come ? 26.82695795279726
Had it been your uncle ' s doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . 2.1017480113324885
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 6.812920690579612
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ' s performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste . 2.7213387683753076
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! 3.8746751204561316
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an <UNK> of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . 2.0092330025650473
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . 4.216965034285822
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 1.7082763938087104
I must have employment and society . 12.915496650148839
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . 2.7213387683753076
Consider Mr . Collins ' s respectability , and Charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . 3.359818286283782
The <UNK> <UNK> of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in <UNK> with her opinion of each . 1.4977474763452014
A <UNK> life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . 2.9935772947204895
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity . 1.4330125702369627
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . 2.0092330025650473
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity . 1.9684194472866121
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 2.7213387683753076
Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn . 4.216965034285822
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . 6.812920690579612
After a short silence , the lady first spoke . 6.812920690579612
I am sure you will be very comfortable there . 6.812920690579612
In a few minutes , Mrs . 12.915496650148839
<UNK> had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and <UNK> her disgust of Mr . Collins . 2.9935772947204895
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . 2.9935772947204895
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . 5.878016072274914
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 1.8632463119315603
" What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? 2.9935772947204895
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . 1.8329807108324359
He leaves out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <UNK> . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must <UNK> reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility . 1.333521432163324
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 1.302994338575022
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . 1.5706464294715548
They would doubtless be <UNK> with the generality of female minds . 5.179474679231212
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . 2.51188643150958
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . 2.2758459260747883
Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! Yes certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . " And <UNK> her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma ' am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr . Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . 1.2710617996147449
" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . 1.557068404753731
London Printed for T . 26.82695795279726
He was my <UNK> , and excessively attached to me . 5.878016072274914
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 1.8957356524063758
Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . 2.9935772947204895
Nothing could be more delightful ! 17.78279410038923
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . 2.2758459260747883
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle . 3.1622776601683795
Society , I own , is necessary to me . 6.812920690579612
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . 4.641588833612778
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . 1.4330125702369627
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her <UNK> , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . " " She had better have <UNK> at home , " cried Elizabeth ; " perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours . 1.2843862635897427
We must have Mrs . 26.82695795279726
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish . 1.1937766417144364
END OF VOL . 46.415888336127786
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . 10.000000000000002
But I dare not hope it . 12.915496650148839
He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable house . 3.1622776601683795
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 1.7301957388458942
People do not die of little trifling <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <UNK> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <UNK> , and paid off every <UNK> of civility to Elizabeth . 1.4677992676220695
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . 1.632172128563275
Her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 1.6681005372000588
<UNK> has she condescended to give me her opinion <UNK> too ! on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our <UNK> at quadrille , while Mrs . 1.8047217668271702
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . 3.359818286283782
Hurst was observing their game . 17.78279410038923
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . 3.8746751204561316
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . 3.8746751204561316
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . 1.8632463119315603
I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 1.4174741629268053
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister . 2.154434690031884
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! 3.8746751204561316
only think ! 100.00000000000004
She is gone down to her uncle at <UNK> ; gone to stay . 4.216965034285822
Your <UNK> must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance . 2.0092330025650473
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last <UNK> , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were <UNK> answered . 1.8329807108324359
Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . 1.4677992676220695
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . 2.346228848142263
I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . 4.216965034285822
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . " " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! 1.7082763938087104
There was no want of discourse . 12.915496650148839
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn house . 5.179474679231212
Jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all . 5.878016072274914
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . 3.1622776601683795
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . 3.359818286283782
You have delighted us long enough . 12.915496650148839
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . 1.5848931924611136
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . " " I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want . " " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " No , indeed . 1.4677992676220695
I dare say he often <UNK> worse things said than I am going to say . 3.593813663804627
<UNK> , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . 1.6496480740980204
Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . " CHAPTER XIII . 2.7213387683753076
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 2.51188643150958
Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at <UNK> , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
Nor was Darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 2.7213387683753076
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 1.2401035305418566
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . 2.610157215682537
You take delight in <UNK> me . 12.915496650148839
Philips ' s manners and politeness . 12.915496650148839
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged . 2.0535250264571463
And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined . 1.7082763938087104
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . <UNK> are never of so much consequence to a father . 2.4244620170823286
She practises very constantly . " " So much the better . 5.179474679231212
She is almost three and twenty ! 12.915496650148839
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 2.0535250264571463
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <UNK> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <UNK> . 1.6496480740980204
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . 2.610157215682537
I speak nothing but the truth . 12.915496650148839
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone . 1.7301957388458942
Bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . 1.8957356524063758
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " This was invitation enough . 2.610157215682537
Her father <UNK> by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and <UNK> mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . 1.5706464294715548
Very well . 100.00000000000004
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . 3.593813663804627
You cannot have been always at Longbourn . " Elizabeth looked surprised . 4.641588833612778
Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a <UNK> to buy clothes for his daughter . 2.51188643150958
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
The <UNK> and yet the noise ; the <UNK> and yet the self importance of all these people ! What would I give to hear your <UNK> on them ! " " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . 1.6876124757881477
Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . " Then addressing her daughter , " Oh ! 2.346228848142263
Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 2.0535250264571463
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 3.593813663804627
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My <UNK> were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte . 1.41011239906908
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . " " My dear , you flatter me . 1.5085907086001784
" His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . 5.179474679231212
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . 4.641588833612778
But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . " " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " Yes . 1.6876124757881477
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , <UNK> to invite him to sit by herself . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 2.346228848142263
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged . 1.9684194472866121
She had very little notice from any but him . 6.812920690579612
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 1.6496480740980204
<UNK> and <UNK> I can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart . 2.4244620170823286
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage . 2.610157215682537
Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ' s arm <UNK> to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s . 2.0535250264571463
Your idea of the ponies is delightful . 10.000000000000002
Have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs . 5.878016072274914
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . 1.8329807108324359
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North . 2.0092330025650473
" A <UNK> ! " she cried . 10.000000000000002

CHAPTER XIV . 100.00000000000004
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 4.641588833612778
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . 2.4244620170823286
We seem to have been designed for each other . " Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she <UNK> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . 1.6496480740980204
F . 316.22776601683796
I speak <UNK> . 46.415888336127786
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 1.8957356524063758
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 1.632172128563275
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly <UNK> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . 1.7082763938087104
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 1.3287913432286882
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 3.8746751204561316
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . 2.4244620170823286
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . 1.3287913432286882
A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it <UNK> from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . 2.4244620170823286
It was all pride and <UNK> . 12.915496650148839
CHAPTER VIII . 100.00000000000004
" Kitty and I are going <UNK> to sit in my dressing room . " Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room . 1.5848931924611136
" Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 1.353876180022544
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the <UNK> , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening . 1.221677348996792
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 3.1622776601683795
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Mr . Darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <UNK> throughout the whole . 1.5199110829529336
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so . 2.346228848142263
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 6.812920690579612
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there . 4.641588833612778
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 4.216965034285822
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 1.5441135899948315
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . 3.359818286283782
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 3.359818286283782
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and <UNK> , and talk and laugh all the way home . 2.8480358684358014
But it must not , shall not be . 8.11130830789687
CHAPTER X . 100.00000000000004
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . 2.154434690031884
Lord ! 316.22776601683796
Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . 2.0092330025650473
" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . 2.346228848142263
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . 1.6496480740980204
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . 3.359818286283782
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 10.000000000000002
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being <UNK> dressed . 4.216965034285822
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals . 2.154434690031884
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget ' had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ' Those were your words . 2.154434690031884
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy ' s regard . " " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? " " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . " " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy . 1.4174741629268053
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her <UNK> of Mrs . 4.641588833612778
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 2.1017480113324885
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . 2.1017480113324885
" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your <UNK> appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . " " Oh ! 1.3433993325989002
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat <UNK> attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must <UNK> every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <UNK> . 1.3894954943731377
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the <UNK> , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <UNK> . 1.6496480740980204
Her own thoughts were <UNK> her . 12.915496650148839
" Your affectionate friend , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " Oh ! 4.641588833612778
" Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . 3.593813663804627
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 1.4585940117250362
Mr . Darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . 5.179474679231212
Bennet and the children . 26.82695795279726
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most . 3.359818286283782
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 1.615598098439874
And is it really true ? 17.78279410038923
" You write uncommonly fast . " " You are mistaken . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . 3.8746751204561316
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 2.0535250264571463
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , <UNK> , manner of talking to her brother . 1.8047217668271702
Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would . 3.1622776601683795
He has the promise of an <UNK> in General ' s regiment , now quartered in the North . 2.9935772947204895
CHAPTER XVII . 100.00000000000004
I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to <UNK> such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room . 1.4773776525985112
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 2.2758459260747883
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist . 2.51188643150958
Miss Darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . 5.878016072274914
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 2.8480358684358014
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . 1.3485595530525598
" Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated . 4.216965034285822
" You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . 5.878016072274914
how can it affect them ? " " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! 2.2122162910704493
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 2.2758459260747883
I am quite well . 26.82695795279726
CHAPTER <UNK> . 100.00000000000004
" Good Heaven ! 46.415888336127786
Their reception at home was most kind . 10.000000000000002
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . 1.8632463119315603
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they <UNK> . 2.346228848142263
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " I have just received your letter , and shall <UNK> this whole morning to answering it , as I <UNK> that a little writing will not <UNK> what I have to tell you . 1.7301957388458942
We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 2.7213387683753076
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . 1.5998587196060583
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
They soon <UNK> the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . " In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . 1.5706464294715548
Four nieces of Mrs . 26.82695795279726
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . 2.9935772947204895
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <UNK> . 2.4244620170823286
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 2.154434690031884
" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself . 2.610157215682537
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 5.878016072274914
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in <UNK> it after this explanation . " Mr . Darcy , who was <UNK> against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . 1.4497406703726319
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . 4.641588833612778
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette . 4.641588833612778
" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech . 2.7213387683753076
Well , but now for my news it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? 2.51188643150958
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . 2.7213387683753076
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 5.878016072274914
He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? 2.2758459260747883
Elizabeth silently attended her . 26.82695795279726
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the <UNK> on guard , and dressing a <UNK> and <UNK> . 1.93069772888325
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 3.8746751204561316
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . 2.1017480113324885
<UNK> pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . 2.610157215682537
I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! 2.1017480113324885
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back . 6.812920690579612
There was also a <UNK> of one thousand pounds . 6.812920690579612
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . 3.8746751204561316
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . 2.1017480113324885
I shall like it of all things . 10.000000000000002
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object . 10.000000000000002
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr . Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . 1.5441135899948315
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . 1.1987818459583777
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was <UNK> her feelings in <UNK> on Elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . 1.632172128563275
" They will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . 1.6681005372000588
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 3.359818286283782
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <UNK> circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her <UNK> and steady candour always <UNK> for <UNK> , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 1.4773776525985112
Whatever bears affinity to <UNK> is <UNK> . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 2.346228848142263
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances and to have Mr . Collins instead ! 2.8480358684358014
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . " " I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which <UNK> in <UNK> a respectable man . 1.3830728955554412
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . 1.4497406703726319
He was on one side of her mother . 8.11130830789687
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . 3.359818286283782
She is well , and <UNK> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . Your ' s , c . 2.610157215682537
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room . 1.4330125702369627
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . 2.0092330025650473
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 5.878016072274914
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <UNK> <UNK> . 2.0092330025650473
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . 8.11130830789687
Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . 1.778279410038923
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 2.0535250264571463
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . 1.7534865500829584
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 2.7213387683753076
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . " " That is his notion of christian forgiveness ! 1.7301957388458942
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . 2.346228848142263
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . " " Aye that is because you have the right disposition . 2.2122162910704493
" My dear , dear aunt , " she <UNK> cried , " what delight ! 3.593813663804627
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable . 2.2758459260747883
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . 1.5706464294715548
dear me ! 100.00000000000004
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <UNK> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 1.4412195967188537
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 2.610157215682537
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , <UNK> every chance of <UNK> himself by marrying well ? 1.8047217668271702
Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 1.4174741629268053
His disposition must be dreadful . " " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . " Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from <UNK> , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! " " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; <UNK> of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same <UNK> care . 1.1450475699382818
" I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr . Darcy ! " " It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . " " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . " " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . " " <UNK> ! 1.2560585988318853
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 5.179474679231212
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 1.9684194472866121
Why must she be <UNK> about the country , because her sister had a cold ? 3.593813663804627
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . 4.641588833612778
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 1.4773776525985112
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . 2.7213387683753076
Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant <UNK> to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " I do not know . I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult . 1.5085907086001784
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <UNK> <UNK> better than <UNK> ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 1.1844845812380058
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 3.8746751204561316
To Mr . Bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 1.7082763938087104
. F . . <UNK> You agree to <UNK> and hold the Foundation , the trademark owner , any <UNK> or <UNK> of the Foundation , anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement , and any volunteers associated with the <UNK> , <UNK> and distribution of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works , <UNK> from all liability , costs and expenses , including legal fees , that arise directly or <UNK> from any of the following which you do or cause to occur a distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg tm work , <UNK> alteration , <UNK> , or additions or <UNK> to any Project Gutenberg tm work , and c any <UNK> you cause . 1.202264434617413
My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . 1.4873521072935114
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . 4.641588833612778
What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! 8.11130830789687
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out . She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . 1.295267744355328
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . " " And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the <UNK> of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! 1.2915496650148839
Information about the <UNK> of Project Gutenberg tm Project Gutenberg tm is <UNK> with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including <UNK> , old , middle <UNK> and new computers . 1.7301957388458942
what hours of <UNK> we shall spend ! 10.000000000000002
Good girl ! 100.00000000000004
Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment . 8.11130830789687
It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . 1.8632463119315603
She declared her resolution . 26.82695795279726
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton . 2.9935772947204895
Perhaps he thought her too young . 12.915496650148839
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . 3.359818286283782
Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go . 2.1017480113324885
What say you , Mary ? 17.78279410038923
He had to be sure done much . 10.000000000000002
' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! What , all five out at once ? 1.557068404753731
Why should they try to influence him ? 10.000000000000002
<UNK> me whilst you can . " " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . " " Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . " " I cannot believe it . 1.8047217668271702
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . 1.778279410038923
My fingers wait your orders . " " Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . " " Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1.4585940117250362
If the <UNK> of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . 1.9684194472866121
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . " " But my father cannot . He wrote last week to hurry my return . " " Oh ! 2.1017480113324885
Gardiner . 316.22776601683796
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 1.5848931924611136
Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general <UNK> , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . 1.6496480740980204
Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 2.154434690031884
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 2.1017480113324885
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would <UNK> his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . 1.365007806546014
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . 3.593813663804627
The journey would moreover give her a <UNK> at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . 1.9684194472866121
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well . 3.1622776601683795
She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <UNK> in so small a family as her ' s , and <UNK> her as to the care of her <UNK> and her poultry . 1.4330125702369627
Though Lydia ' s short letter to Mrs . 8.11130830789687
They were within twenty <UNK> of each other , and so <UNK> was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . 2.346228848142263
Allowing for the common <UNK> of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy . 1.4977474763452014
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 2.1017480113324885
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . 5.878016072274914
Such a countenance , such manners ! 12.915496650148839
Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . 1.4585940117250362
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 2.51188643150958
CHAPTER XI . 100.00000000000004
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 2.1017480113324885
It is admirable ! " Elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 2.346228848142263
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 1.2451970847350329
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . " " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . 1.615598098439874
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your <UNK> . " " I should imagine not . " " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . 1.353876180022544
During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <UNK> , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . 1.5085907086001784
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation . 2.7213387683753076
Oh , Lizzy ! 46.415888336127786
If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go . 5.179474679231212
<UNK> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 2.2758459260747883
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some <UNK> in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . 1.295267744355328
" Upon my word , " said Mrs . 8.11130830789687
In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . 2.154434690031884
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 3.1622776601683795
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . 2.0535250264571463
What is it you are talking of ? 10.000000000000002
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . 1.5998587196060583
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! 2.9935772947204895
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 4.216965034285822
CHAPTER XIX . 100.00000000000004
Her mother <UNK> <UNK> , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 1.615598098439874
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " " That you certainly shall . " " And I have another favour to ask . 1.7301957388458942
<UNK> me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . " Elizabeth could not refuse , though she <UNK> little pleasure in the visit . 2.346228848142263
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 2.2758459260747883
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . 1.7082763938087104
What are we to do ! " would they often <UNK> in the bitterness of <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia ' s leaving home . 2.154434690031884
Bennet , alarmed . 46.415888336127786
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and <UNK> way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to morrow evening . 1.615598098439874
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . 5.179474679231212
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . 2.4244620170823286
I will only add , God bless you . 8.11130830789687
He cannot afford it . 26.82695795279726
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was <UNK> her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs . 1.41011239906908
" Oh , Lizzy ! 26.82695795279726
She opened the door , and met Maria in the <UNK> place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza ! 2.1017480113324885
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this <UNK> . 2.1017480113324885
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 1.615598098439874
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . 2.9935772947204895
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! " cried Elizabeth when she had finished it . 4.216965034285822
It is useless to talk of it . " It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . 2.1017480113324885
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . 5.179474679231212
Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion . 4.216965034285822
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 1.7534865500829584
They were in street . 26.82695795279726
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Your <UNK> are by no means unlike . 10.000000000000002
yes I understand you perfectly . " " I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . " " That is as it happens . 1.7534865500829584
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <UNK> manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . 2.0092330025650473
They saw him often , and to his other <UNK> was now added that of general <UNK> . 3.1622776601683795
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . " Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . 1.8632463119315603
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at Longbourn . 2.4244620170823286
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . " " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth . 1.4677992676220695
I wish you had been there . 12.915496650148839
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . 8.11130830789687
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs . 1.8957356524063758
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . 2.8480358684358014
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . 3.593813663804627
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 5.878016072274914
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly <UNK> . 1.5848931924611136
I am so grieved for him . 12.915496650148839
" From what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs . 4.641588833612778
" To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . 3.1622776601683795
He now wished it more than ever . 10.000000000000002
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , <UNK> from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and <UNK> by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 1.3593563908785256
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the <UNK> of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . 1.41011239906908
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 1.93069772888325
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ' s visit . 1.6496480740980204
where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without <UNK> a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . 1.4773776525985112
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 5.878016072274914
Long . 316.22776601683796
Jane was not happy . 26.82695795279726
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled . 2.2758459260747883
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and <UNK> them , after a short <UNK> , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . 1.778279410038923
Darcy said nothing at all . 17.78279410038923
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 8.11130830789687
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . 1.8047217668271702
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . 2.9935772947204895
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 2.51188643150958
In the hall they parted . 17.78279410038923
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . " " Oh ! 1.6496480740980204
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . 1.396135390856794
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one <UNK> in it an object of compassion , while they are <UNK> of our intimacy at Rosings . " <UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> . 1.3485595530525598
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . 1.7301957388458942
He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would <UNK> more birds on the first of <UNK> , than any body else in the country . 1.9684194472866121
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 1.3433993325989002
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . 5.179474679231212
" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But now we may be silent . " " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " Sometimes . 1.5085907086001784
Bennet very dull for several days . 12.915496650148839
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs . 10.000000000000002
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to <UNK> him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <UNK> of your understanding , but <UNK> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <UNK> , and those which <UNK> the <UNK> ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the <UNK> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 1.1092898648952227
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 1.2560585988318853
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas . 8.11130830789687
Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . 2.51188643150958
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it . 1.3287913432286882
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . 3.593813663804627
" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides <UNK> tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! " Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . 1.333521432163324
Not all that Mrs . 26.82695795279726
" Then , who taught you ? 12.915496650148839
One must speak a little , you know . 8.11130830789687
She had been <UNK> pleased to approve of both the <UNK> , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . 2.4244620170823286
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? 6.812920690579612
<UNK> it , Kitty ? " Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . 3.593813663804627
You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs . 5.878016072274914
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . 3.1622776601683795
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . 2.4244620170823286
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . " " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal <UNK> of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first <UNK> for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . 1.2775649214671148
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 2.346228848142263
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . 8.11130830789687
yes , " said Elizabeth drily " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a <UNK> deal of care of him . " " <UNK> of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care . 1.5085907086001784
" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her . 3.1622776601683795
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . 3.359818286283782
She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . 4.216965034285822
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . 1.6876124757881477
They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . " " <UNK> a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . 1.3593563908785256
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s foot <UNK> , that she said , ' Mr . Collins , you must marry . 2.4244620170823286
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more <UNK> purpose . 3.1622776601683795
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . 1.2077226551344626
Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . 1.6681005372000588
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and <UNK> them up , though as she never came without <UNK> some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or <UNK> , she seldom went away without leaving them more <UNK> than she found them . 1.4773776525985112
From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . 6.812920690579612
On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a <UNK> , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy . 1.4030037231905736
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 1.5441135899948315
Of this she was perfectly <UNK> ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . 1.93069772888325
Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " Lord , how tired I am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn . 1.8632463119315603
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time . 2.7213387683753076
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . 1.778279410038923
dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . 4.641588833612778
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . 8.11130830789687
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . 3.8746751204561316
Who could about such a <UNK> little <UNK> thing ? " Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <UNK> and fancied liberal ! 1.615598098439874

Oh ! 316.22776601683796
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . 1.8047217668271702
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . 4.216965034285822
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . 2.154434690031884
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 2.51188643150958
My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his <UNK> in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . 1.365007806546014
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had <UNK> <UNK> only four months ago , would now have been <UNK> and gratefully received ! 1.8329807108324359
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
But enough of this . 26.82695795279726
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 1.4677992676220695
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . 3.593813663804627
Nobody wants him to come . 17.78279410038923
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 2.51188643150958
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 2.7213387683753076
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 1.8632463119315603
But , Lizzy ! 46.415888336127786
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 3.593813663804627
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <UNK> of my son in law . 1.8632463119315603
I must beg to return to the house . " And she rose as she spoke . 3.359818286283782
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 2.8480358684358014
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <UNK> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . 2.346228848142263
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 6.812920690579612
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your ' s seems to have been . 2.346228848142263
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . " " To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 1.5998587196060583

Philips first brought her the news . " Well , so much the better . 3.8746751204561316
The pain of separation , however , might be <UNK> on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . 1.5085907086001784
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . 3.8746751204561316
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 3.8746751204561316
Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at <UNK> , and Mrs . 4.216965034285822
From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an <UNK> chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . 1.5998587196060583
" Good Heaven ! 46.415888336127786
" I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could . 2.346228848142263
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . 1.5848931924611136
How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! 3.8746751204561316
Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . 2.2122162910704493
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <UNK> and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " Wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of accents , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right . 1.1721022975334803
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply <UNK> on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . 1.8329807108324359
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 2.8480358684358014
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . " " Not as you represent it . 2.8480358684358014
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . 2.9935772947204895
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother How is she ? 2.1017480113324885
I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 2.154434690031884
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in <UNK> to the proposal before him . 1.8632463119315603
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . 2.346228848142263
my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 2.9935772947204895
But she is nothing to me now . 10.000000000000002
There was no help for it however . 10.000000000000002
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . 5.878016072274914
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern . 5.878016072274914
They were ignorant , idle , and vain . 8.11130830789687
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 4.216965034285822
I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . " " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . 1.4873521072935114
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <UNK> than to herself . 5.179474679231212
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! How much of good or evil must be done by him ! 1.5706464294715548
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 1.7082763938087104
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! <UNK> our surprise . 1.5706464294715548
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . 3.593813663804627
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . " " I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a kingdom ! 1.557068404753731
Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet one communication would , therefore , do for all . 5.878016072274914
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it . 1.8329807108324359
I was never more <UNK> ! 17.78279410038923
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 2.51188643150958

CHAPTER X . 100.00000000000004
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so . 3.593813663804627
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling . " " Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose . 2.154434690031884
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of <UNK> the mind of his wife . 1.3830728955554412
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 2.610157215682537
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 1.8047217668271702
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <UNK> in the gaieties which that season generally <UNK> , and that your <UNK> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall <UNK> you . " " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . " " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . " " Why will you think so ? 1.28792362543363
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . Oh ! 4.216965034285822
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . 2.154434690031884
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it . 3.8746751204561316
" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . 3.359818286283782
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs . 4.641588833612778
" This will not do , " said Elizabeth . 6.812920690579612
I do think Mrs . 26.82695795279726
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his <UNK> powers had gained him in the <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 2.1017480113324885
Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home . 1.5441135899948315
<UNK> , <UNK> , . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations . 3.359818286283782
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 1.778279410038923
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted , is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK> their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and <UNK> them earnestly . But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . 1.0841458689358348
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason . 1.5998587196060583
Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a <UNK> over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was <UNK> Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <UNK> . 1.4412195967188537
" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
" And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! 2.7213387683753076
Elizabeth merely <UNK> to him , without saying a word . 5.878016072274914
<UNK> of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . " Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! 3.593813663804627
Hurst began again . 46.415888336127786
Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs . 1.1905772393787835
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 2.8480358684358014
" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . 2.4244620170823286
The day of his and Lydia ' s departure soon came , and Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him . 3.359818286283782
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . 1.6496480740980204
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
Jane <UNK> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour . 1.4977474763452014
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . 2.9935772947204895
' Tis as good as a Lord ! 10.000000000000002
Elizabeth longed to <UNK> its <UNK> ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . 2.346228848142263
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy . 3.593813663804627
Miss Darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . 1.5706464294715548
Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . 1.8329807108324359
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence . 1.4977474763452014
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 2.1017480113324885
But will they make you happy ? " " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " <UNK> at all . 1.93069772888325

I cannot do justice to his kindness . 10.000000000000002
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . " " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be <UNK> beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen . 1.4773776525985112
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . 3.1622776601683795
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . 1.7082763938087104
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction . 4.216965034285822
Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . 8.11130830789687
" It must not be thought of . 10.000000000000002
Very nonsensical to come at all ! 12.915496650148839
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . 1.8957356524063758
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . 2.2122162910704493
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious . 1.338388753173757
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . 10.000000000000002
" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir . 4.641588833612778
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most <UNK> in inviting Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 1.2589254117941673
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? 1.615598098439874
Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a <UNK> profit c <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under the laws of the state of <UNK> and <UNK> tax exempt status by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . 1.7082763938087104
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and <UNK> , though <UNK> families . 1.8957356524063758
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . 2.0535250264571463
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . 5.179474679231212
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great <UNK> . 4.216965034285822
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough . 17.78279410038923
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . 2.610157215682537
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " Oh ! 2.0535250264571463
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them . 4.216965034285822
" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam . 1.2328467394420661
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater <UNK> concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being <UNK> by <UNK> , <UNK> inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . 1.6681005372000588
I have not that pain . 17.78279410038923
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she <UNK> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . 1.425102670302998
If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 2.4244620170823286
In understanding Darcy was the superior . 12.915496650148839
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was . 2.346228848142263
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
The hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . " Elizabeth was distressed . 3.8746751204561316
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be <UNK> to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a <UNK> nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . 1.4030037231905736
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its <UNK> was visiting and news . 2.9935772947204895
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . " " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . 1.5441135899948315
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her . 2.0092330025650473
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <UNK> the excellent understanding , and <UNK> excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 1.2843862635897427
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 2.9935772947204895
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . 4.216965034285822
We will go round the Park every day . 8.11130830789687
He has heartily <UNK> me now . " Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . 1.8047217668271702
I am impatient to see him . " " In point of <UNK> , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective . 2.2758459260747883
Gardiner . 316.22776601683796
" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she . 3.593813663804627
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 1.4497406703726319
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 2.2122162910704493
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia ' s marriage . 3.1622776601683795
<UNK> that may be , you are <UNK> to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs . 2.51188643150958
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the <UNK> of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 1.4977474763452014
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 3.593813663804627
" I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . 1.778279410038923
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . 1.632172128563275
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . 6.812920690579612
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 1.4497406703726319
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed ! 5.179474679231212
Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 3.359818286283782
Lydia <UNK> as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very <UNK> solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips <UNK> of turning away <UNK> , and if he does , Colonel Forster will <UNK> him . 1.4977474763452014
Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him . 3.1622776601683795
Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . 5.179474679231212
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 1.5441135899948315
Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . 3.8746751204561316
A little time therefore . I shall certainly try to get the better . " With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . " " My dear Jane ! " exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good . 1.353876180022544
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to <UNK> the engagements that had been made for him . 1.632172128563275
The vague and unsettled suspicions which <UNK> had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 1.3768571648527583
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 4.216965034285822
Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . " After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! 1.4330125702369627
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . 1.615598098439874
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 2.8480358684358014
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet . They had several children . 12.915496650148839
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth ! 2.2122162910704493
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in <UNK> <UNK> to be her husband , might then have <UNK> in its proper place . 2.1017480113324885
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be <UNK> so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . 2.1017480113324885
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and Mrs . 1.778279410038923
But his pride , his abominable pride , his <UNK> avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in <UNK> , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . 1.353876180022544
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 2.610157215682537
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 6.812920690579612
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 1.7534865500829584
I never was . 46.415888336127786
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 3.1622776601683795
I will speak to her about it myself directly . 6.812920690579612
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr . Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . 1.4030037231905736
" <UNK> in other words , you are determined to have him . 4.641588833612778
Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . 1.8329807108324359
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained . 4.641588833612778
Jane now came up . 26.82695795279726
I quite detest the man . " CHAPTER IV . 6.812920690579612
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . 2.2758459260747883
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 4.216965034285822
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 6.812920690579612
CHAPTER XII . 100.00000000000004
She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet by admiring Mrs . 26.82695795279726
Heaven forbid ! 100.00000000000004
Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? " " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . 1.8047217668271702
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <UNK> have alarmed her . 2.610157215682537
They are my old friends . 17.78279410038923
" Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? 4.641588833612778
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 2.0092330025650473
You must and shall be married by a special licence . 5.878016072274914
Who are your uncles and <UNK> ? 12.915496650148839
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " <UNK> so I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . 1.2809343786525484
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 1.5998587196060583
Elizabeth immediately began playing again . 17.78279410038923
Every <UNK> <UNK> in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther <UNK> of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago <UNK> his <UNK> in the affair ; that proud and <UNK> as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had <UNK> brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be <UNK> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <UNK> or <UNK> habits . 1.2305240043592616
To Caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit . 2.8480358684358014
How are you all ? " " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 2.51188643150958
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . 2.1017480113324885
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 3.8746751204561316
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . 2.346228848142263
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . " " If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . 1.4330125702369627
He <UNK> how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an <UNK> manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there . 2.0092330025650473
We do not suffer by accident . 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . 1.615598098439874
Let me hear from you very soon . 10.000000000000002
III . 316.22776601683796
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . 2.51188643150958
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . 2.2758459260747883
I will put on my things in a moment . 6.812920690579612
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to <UNK> , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to <UNK> his prosperous love . 1.3830728955554412
<UNK> , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ? 5.179474679231212
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . 4.641588833612778
<UNK> the Foundation as set forth in Section below . 6.812920690579612
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw <UNK> in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . 1.4174741629268053
After playing some <UNK> <UNK> , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to <UNK> such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " She smiled , but made no answer . 1.4330125702369627
You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg tm works . 3.1622776601683795
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . 6.812920690579612
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <UNK> <UNK> necessary . 1.8632463119315603
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 2.8480358684358014
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . 6.812920690579612
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . 2.610157215682537
As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . 1.7301957388458942
Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the <UNK> of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . 1.6496480740980204
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 3.1622776601683795
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . 2.0535250264571463
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself . 2.51188643150958
I am sure I <UNK> ' <UNK> get a wink of sleep all night . 3.8746751204561316
Lydia ' s going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . 2.2122162910704493
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . 6.812920690579612
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged <UNK> of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . 1.5998587196060583
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on . 1.7534865500829584
Jane looked a little <UNK> than usual , but more <UNK> than Elizabeth had expected . 3.593813663804627
<UNK> will be absolutely <UNK> , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . 3.593813663804627
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . 2.9935772947204895
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly <UNK> , she seated herself . 1.8329807108324359
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . 1.8957356524063758
You see how continually we are engaged there . 8.11130830789687
" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire . 2.154434690031884
<UNK> of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where . 4.641588833612778
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . " They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . " " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence . " " You cannot be too much on your guard . 1.1537502316781654
There could not <UNK> in the world two men , over whom Mr . Darcy could have such <UNK> influence . 2.7213387683753076
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a <UNK> fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered <UNK> to the repeated <UNK> of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 1.2809343786525484
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <UNK> them . 4.216965034285822
I depend on you for that . " To these high <UNK> expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the <UNK> of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . 1.2843862635897427
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 3.593813663804627
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . 2.0092330025650473
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . 1.7082763938087104
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . " Kitty , who took all these <UNK> in a serious light , began to <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to <UNK> , and was but slightly affected by his <UNK> of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the <UNK> altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh . 1.28792362543363
how he must have felt it ! " " I never saw any one so shocked . 3.359818286283782
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . 3.359818286283782
Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent <UNK> and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . " Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " You cannot have a right to such very strong <UNK> attachment . 1.4030037231905736
A person may be proud without being vain . 8.11130830789687
But I confess they would have no charms for me . 5.878016072274914
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
For your sake , " turning to Charlotte , " I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for <UNK> estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh ' s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? " " A little . " " Oh ! 1.4330125702369627
Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . 6.812920690579612
After <UNK> their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ? 2.0092330025650473
" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the <UNK> <UNK> above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <UNK> than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . 1.221677348996792
She has two nieces of her own . 10.000000000000002
my sweetest Lizzy ! 46.415888336127786
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 4.216965034285822
" Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . 1.41011239906908
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . 8.11130830789687
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . 3.8746751204561316
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ' s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . 1.8329807108324359
" And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 1.778279410038923
But there are two things that I want very much to know one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . " " <UNK> ! 1.632172128563275
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . 4.216965034285822
<UNK> in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . 6.812920690579612
Mr . Darcy <UNK> it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . 1.4497406703726319
I always had a value for him . 10.000000000000002
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried . 4.641588833612778
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious <UNK> , denoted a recollection of Jane , not <UNK> by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . 1.4873521072935114
Had Elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . 2.1017480113324885
You are not going to be <UNK> , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . 2.7213387683753076
" Not yet , " replied Jane . 10.000000000000002
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . 2.7213387683753076
It <UNK> me . 46.415888336127786
Bennet with civil self command to Miss Lucas . 8.11130830789687
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house . 4.216965034285822
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . 2.4244620170823286
Bennet ' s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . 3.593813663804627
I hate such false friends . 17.78279410038923
Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> . 1.7301957388458942
I thought I should have died . 12.915496650148839
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . " " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be . 1.2679227183627855
Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s <UNK> , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any <UNK> of sentiment . If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error . 1.353876180022544
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . " " Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . 1.632172128563275
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ' s regiment . " His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative . 1.557068404753731
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? " " Most willingly . " " You shall have it in few words . 1.6681005372000588
Every thing that is charming ! 17.78279410038923
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge . 1.8957356524063758
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " Ah ! 1.8329807108324359
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not <UNK> me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . 1.4330125702369627
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
They had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister . 4.216965034285822
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
For God ' s sake , say no more of his partners . 4.641588833612778
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . " Her father lifted up his eyes . 2.7213387683753076
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . " " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . 1.2618568830660204
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
He is gone to my father already . 10.000000000000002
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley ' s <UNK> on fine eyes . 1.396135390856794
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 3.593813663804627
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . 1.557068404753731
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . 2.346228848142263
Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a <UNK> kind of a little <UNK> on one side of your lawn . 1.4412195967188537
Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . 1.3593563908785256
The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion . 5.179474679231212
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 2.154434690031884
what could she mean by it ? 12.915496650148839
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . 10.000000000000002
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . 2.8480358684358014
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she <UNK> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . " Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . Wickham ' s attentions . 1.2352165993694857
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . 1.9684194472866121
<UNK> since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 2.610157215682537
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 1.7301957388458942
These recollections will not do at all . 10.000000000000002
Reynolds was of no trifling nature . 12.915496650148839
He has children of his own , and may have more . 5.179474679231212
Now is your time . 26.82695795279726
Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . 2.8480358684358014
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many <UNK> of that nature . 1.615598098439874
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 1.778279410038923
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . 2.2758459260747883
They agreed that Mrs . 26.82695795279726
" For my own part , " she <UNK> , " I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . 2.4244620170823286
never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F . 2.8480358684358014
You never see a fault in any body . 8.11130830789687
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey . 3.359818286283782
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be <UNK> . 3.1622776601683795
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so <UNK> that I cannot answer for being <UNK> . 1.6496480740980204
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . 2.2122162910704493
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 3.8746751204561316
On finding Mrs . 46.415888336127786
And what sort of table do they keep ? 8.11130830789687
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . 6.812920690579612
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure . " The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs . 1.4030037231905736
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented . 3.1622776601683795
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time . 4.641588833612778
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . 4.216965034285822
I hope they will not meet at all . 8.11130830789687
Bennet . 316.22776601683796
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . 5.878016072274914
" I am sorry it went off . 10.000000000000002
Make haste , and come down this moment . " Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . 1.4773776525985112
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . 1.93069772888325
my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " Oh , lord ! 2.7213387683753076
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 1.5998587196060583
<UNK> as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . 1.4677992676220695
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley ' s heart were entertained . 2.154434690031884
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to <UNK> her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever <UNK> . 1.4873521072935114
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 1.3593563908785256
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . " It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . 1.5998587196060583
At night she opened her heart to Jane . 8.11130830789687
I cannot quite agree with you there . 10.000000000000002
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week . 1.6496480740980204
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 2.4244620170823286
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . " " Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . " " And do you like her ? " " Very much . " " I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . 1.5085907086001784
He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 1.778279410038923
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . 3.1622776601683795
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two . 3.593813663804627
<UNK> would like to go too of all things ! 6.812920690579612
Mr . Collins ! " " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . 2.346228848142263
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <UNK> , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room . 1.8047217668271702
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . 2.2758459260747883
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should <UNK> an occasion of <UNK> his respect towards any body connected with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared . Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . 1.2115276586285884
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . 1.9684194472866121
Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . 2.51188643150958
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . 2.8480358684358014
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . " " <UNK> out , " said Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , <UNK> him I believe very early in life . 1.778279410038923
She could think only of her letter . 10.000000000000002
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 2.51188643150958
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . 1.7301957388458942
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage . 1.7301957388458942
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . 2.4244620170823286
She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . 1.53174046370208
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . 2.51188643150958
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first <UNK> his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . 1.8047217668271702
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . 2.610157215682537
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give <UNK> confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr . Darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr . Darcy in a most infamous manner . 1.396135390856794
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she . 4.216965034285822
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 1.93069772888325
" What could he mean ? 17.78279410038923
" Not at all . 26.82695795279726
who attended to you ? 26.82695795279726
What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a <UNK> of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . " " Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . " " And what arts did he use to separate them ? " " He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling . 1.1844845812380058
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 3.1622776601683795
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" Yet why did he come ? " She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . 2.0092330025650473
His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . 1.93069772888325
She was ashamed to think how much . 10.000000000000002
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . " " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . " Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . 1.41011239906908
Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . 2.346228848142263
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 1.9684194472866121
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 1.41011239906908
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <UNK> , but Mrs . 3.359818286283782
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? 4.641588833612778
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . 1.778279410038923
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 1.7082763938087104
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . 1.5441135899948315
It was to this effect " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well . 1.7301957388458942
" I cannot see why Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 1.4677992676220695
Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 2.2122162910704493
I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . " " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <UNK> of you . 1.2679227183627855
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <UNK> her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 1.5706464294715548
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 1.2305240043592616
So high and so conceited that there was no <UNK> him ! 5.179474679231212
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . " " Oh ! 2.2122162910704493
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such <UNK> sisters , home could not be <UNK> , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake . 1.8329807108324359
I shall <UNK> it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . " And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh ! 1.6496480740980204
If I could but see you as happy ! 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man . 1.8632463119315603
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . 2.9935772947204895
It will pass away soon enough . " " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty . 1.5998587196060583
The <UNK> <UNK> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have . 1.4773776525985112
It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be <UNK> , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham . 1.7082763938087104
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling <UNK> on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give . 1.2505106035854068
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen . 3.8746751204561316
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . 6.812920690579612
Your ' s , c . 17.78279410038923
Is not it so , Mrs . 12.915496650148839
It was agreed to . 26.82695795279726
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 3.359818286283782
" Oh ! " said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . 2.346228848142263
He bore it however with admirable calmness . 10.000000000000002
But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . 1.8632463119315603
But he is an ugly fellow ! 12.915496650148839
It was unpardonable . 46.415888336127786
You mentioned two instances . 26.82695795279726
But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he <UNK> that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 1.338388753173757
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild <UNK> , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character . 2.0092330025650473
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . " " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . 1.365007806546014
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , <UNK> had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 1.4977474763452014
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . " " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister . 1.3768571648527583
" Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . " She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door . 1.4174741629268053
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 1.2742749857031337
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . 1.3433993325989002
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . " " I am , " said he , with a firm voice . 2.154434690031884
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . 3.593813663804627
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . 1.93069772888325
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . 5.179474679231212
" Oh ! 100.00000000000004
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . 2.9935772947204895
This is your <UNK> resolve ! 17.78279410038923
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest . 1.7534865500829584
To his <UNK> engagement with Miss De Bourgh ? 8.11130830789687
<UNK> he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 2.1017480113324885
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 1.5441135899948315
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . 3.359818286283782
" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? " said she . 4.641588833612778
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners <UNK> respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 1.557068404753731
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 1.8632463119315603
Gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . 1.8329807108324359
Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 3.593813663804627
Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously . " Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
But I will not repine . 17.78279410038923
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
I will try again . 26.82695795279726
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . 2.7213387683753076
Mr . Darcy <UNK> you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . 2.9935772947204895
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 1.2648552168552962
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . " " Is that his design in settling here ? " " <UNK> ! 2.154434690031884
My mind was more agreeably engaged . 12.915496650148839
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so <UNK> . 2.2758459260747883
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . " <UNK> as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat <UNK> , she had all the success she expected . 1.319720393061375
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! 1.778279410038923
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . 5.878016072274914
CHAPTER XI . 100.00000000000004
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon . 2.2122162910704493
<UNK> nature is so prone to fall into it ! 6.812920690579612
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . 5.878016072274914
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been <UNK> , and it had actually been <UNK> that Colonel Forster was going to be married . 1.557068404753731
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W . 2.346228848142263
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <UNK> , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 1.41011239906908
Gardiner . 316.22776601683796
I do not trust my own partiality . 10.000000000000002
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . 1.4030037231905736
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . 1.4873521072935114
I know you will contrive it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . 1.319720393061375
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <UNK> ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . 1.5085907086001784
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few <UNK> , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <UNK> . " Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 1.338388753173757
Mr . Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . 2.346228848142263
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it . 3.1622776601683795
Bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . 8.11130830789687
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . 1.7082763938087104
" It may perhaps be pleasant , " replied Charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . 1.8047217668271702
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 1.396135390856794
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 4.641588833612778
Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . 1.3593563908785256
After a slight <UNK> for good news , the letter was read aloud . 4.216965034285822
Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 3.359818286283782
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! 2.610157215682537
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must <UNK> him from such <UNK> misconduct as I have suffered by . 1.8329807108324359
That lady I suppose is your mother . " Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . 3.359818286283782
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> . 2.610157215682537
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ; but his <UNK> about the whole Pemberley family are endless . 2.0092330025650473
Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 1.8957356524063758
If there were but such another man for you ! " " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . 2.0092330025650473
Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 2.2758459260747883
Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . 5.179474679231212
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . 1.4585940117250362
" Well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " What say you to the day ? 2.346228848142263
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! 4.216965034285822
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 1.3708385261355818
They had frequently been staying with her in town . 6.812920690579612
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . 1.5441135899948315
All was joy and kindness . 17.78279410038923
I hope he will overlook it . 12.915496650148839
<UNK> the works from public domain <UNK> editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works , so the Foundation and you ! can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties . 1.6496480740980204
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them . 1.4773776525985112
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 1.3894954943731377
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with . 1.3593563908785256
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . 3.8746751204561316
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 1.2809343786525484
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by <UNK> the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . 1.557068404753731
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . 4.216965034285822
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? 5.878016072274914
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . " " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . 1.4174741629268053
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> . 10.000000000000002
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty . 4.216965034285822
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . 2.51188643150958
<UNK> away the letter immediately and <UNK> a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . " " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . 1.4330125702369627
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . 2.346228848142263
When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . 2.154434690031884
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <UNK> , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 1.7301957388458942
They contained no actual <UNK> , nor was there any <UNK> of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 2.610157215682537
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 2.51188643150958
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . " " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . " " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . 1.3894954943731377
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . 1.7301957388458942
On this subject , what can you have to say ? 5.878016072274914
But my dear Lydia , I don ' t at all like your going such a way off . 2.9935772947204895
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 1.3894954943731377
" Let us sit down . 17.78279410038923
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . 1.5998587196060583
Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend . 2.51188643150958
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 1.5706464294715548
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . 2.0535250264571463
She has a very good notion of <UNK> , though her taste is not equal to Anne ' s . 2.8480358684358014
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of <UNK> should not be broken in on . 2.4244620170823286
" He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . 1.7534865500829584
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 2.7213387683753076
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . 5.179474679231212
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . 4.216965034285822
Good bye . 100.00000000000004
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 2.346228848142263
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 3.1622776601683795
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 1.2560585988318853
I am the happiest creature in the world . 8.11130830789687
He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . 4.216965034285822
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . " " To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . " " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . " " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . 1.221677348996792
So much the better . 26.82695795279726
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . 2.0092330025650473
CHAPTER XIV . 100.00000000000004
If gratitude and esteem are good <UNK> of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 2.51188643150958
Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with <UNK> civility that they were perfectly needless . 2.51188643150958
<UNK> such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not <UNK> the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . 1.425102670302998
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . 5.878016072274914
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 4.216965034285822
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . 1.93069772888325
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 1.8329807108324359
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 1.4773776525985112
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 2.4244620170823286
Have a little compassion on my nerves . 10.000000000000002
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 2.7213387683753076
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and <UNK> <UNK> with great perseverance . 2.610157215682537
One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 1.4412195967188537
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . 3.1622776601683795
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia . 2.610157215682537
They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! 2.2122162910704493
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . 2.7213387683753076
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . 2.8480358684358014
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 1.5998587196060583
Mr . Collins was carefully <UNK> them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <UNK> them . 1.8329807108324359
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . 1.7082763938087104
" <UNK> Oh ! 46.415888336127786
Poor Lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . 2.154434690031884
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . 4.641588833612778
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . 2.8480358684358014
How much you must have gone through ! " Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs . 1.8047217668271702
I told my sister Philips so the other day . 6.812920690579612
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . " Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . 2.2758459260747883
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 3.593813663804627
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 1.4773776525985112
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day . " " Oh , yes . 2.0535250264571463
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? 6.812920690579612
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . 1.365007806546014
" How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . You think it a faithful <UNK> undoubtedly . " " I must not decide on my own performance . " He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . 1.3768571648527583
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . " CHAPTER V . 2.9935772947204895
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . 2.1017480113324885
Are the others coming out ? " " I do not know . 4.641588833612778
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 4.641588833612778
What relates to yourself , is as follows . 8.11130830789687
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . 2.0092330025650473
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 6.812920690579612
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? 2.9935772947204895
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company . 5.878016072274914
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . 1.8329807108324359
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
No , never . 46.415888336127786
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 1.557068404753731
Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 2.51188643150958
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . 5.179474679231212
Collins . 316.22776601683796
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day <UNK> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . 1.5848931924611136
And it is the more to be <UNK> , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte <UNK> me , that this <UNK> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs . 1.4873521072935114
Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night . 2.8480358684358014
Bennet was quite in the <UNK> . 12.915496650148839
Charles , when you <UNK> your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 1.5441135899948315
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 1.425102670302998
" What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? " " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . " " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . 1.4412195967188537
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . 1.6681005372000588
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . 3.8746751204561316
There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . 2.7213387683753076
and Mrs . 100.00000000000004
Hill began instantly to express her joy . 10.000000000000002
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 3.359818286283782
But I have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous <UNK> , boy in the world . " Elizabeth almost stared at her . " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she . 1.4585940117250362
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . 5.179474679231212
But she is perfectly amiable , and often <UNK> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . " " Has she been presented ? 2.1017480113324885
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . 4.641588833612778
Annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs . 1.778279410038923
Long and the Gouldings soon . 17.78279410038923
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I <UNK> believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . 1.4330125702369627
Five daughters <UNK> entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . 3.1622776601683795
You refuse to <UNK> the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . 4.216965034285822
But still he would be her husband . Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . 1.4977474763452014
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . 1.9684194472866121
He drew a chair near her . 12.915496650148839
But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . " " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . " Elizabeth made no answer . 1.3593563908785256
Two <UNK> , however , were plainly <UNK> from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been <UNK> used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 1.4977474763452014
It was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch street by noon . 2.346228848142263
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <UNK> is denied me , because you have always so much . " Mr . Bingley arrived . 1.9684194472866121
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her <UNK> intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . 1.4773776525985112
These were the contents " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . 1.7082763938087104
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . 2.2758459260747883
The time fixed for the beginning of their <UNK> tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever . 1.9684194472866121
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . 1.6681005372000588
Such was Miss Lucas ' s scheme ; and <UNK> were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . 1.7301957388458942
I had hoped that our sentiments <UNK> in every particular , but I must so far <UNK> from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . " " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . 1.353876180022544
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . 3.8746751204561316
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . 6.812920690579612
She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent . 1.5441135899948315

From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 1.3708385261355818
" Yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally <UNK> , without raising all this <UNK> ! 1.8957356524063758
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 2.154434690031884
This is my advice . 26.82695795279726
I am ashamed of you ! 17.78279410038923

I quite forgot ! 46.415888336127786
You supposed more than really existed . 12.915496650148839
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 1.615598098439874
The Foundation ' s principal office is located at <UNK> Dr . S . 4.216965034285822
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . 4.641588833612778
" You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice . 1.7082763938087104
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 1.7534865500829584
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my <UNK> and <UNK> are not usually <UNK> by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of <UNK> ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . Pardon me . It pains me to offend you . 1.0900669780000662
They were hopeless of remedy . 17.78279410038923
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some <UNK> , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . " When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister . 1.181581732618101
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . 4.641588833612778
Kitty was the only one who <UNK> tears ; but she did <UNK> from vexation and envy . 3.1622776601683795
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 1.93069772888325
Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . 2.610157215682537
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . " Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . 1.3830728955554412
but from what the report of their engagement could <UNK> , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . 1.4174741629268053
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . " Miss Bennet eagerly <UNK> all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . 1.7301957388458942
" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . " " It is no such thing . 2.610157215682537
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . " Mrs . 2.154434690031884
It <UNK> , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before . 1.353876180022544
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey . 3.359818286283782
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my <UNK> from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . 2.51188643150958
He had never had the slightest suspicion . 10.000000000000002
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way . 2.8480358684358014
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 2.9935772947204895
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 3.1622776601683795
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to You shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? " " One of them does . " " Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . 1.5998587196060583
Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 3.593813663804627
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . 1.6496480740980204
His revenge would have been complete indeed . 10.000000000000002
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . 1.8632463119315603
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . 3.8746751204561316
All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . 1.6681005372000588
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 1.7534865500829584
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another . 2.0092330025650473
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement . 3.593813663804627
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 4.216965034285822
He owns it himself without disguise . " " No " said Darcy , " I have made no such pretension . 2.610157215682537
Pray do not talk of that odious man . 8.11130830789687
" <UNK> he will not leave London before he has found them . 4.641588833612778
" When my eyes were opened to his real character . Oh ! 4.641588833612778
Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . 2.4244620170823286
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it . 1.4873521072935114
This was agreed to , and Mrs . 10.000000000000002
I cannot understand it . 26.82695795279726
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . 4.216965034285822
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 1.3287913432286882
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 1.5848931924611136
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were <UNK> your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month . " " You have only proved by this , " cried Elizabeth , " that Mr . Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . 1.2710617996147449
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . 1.3485595530525598
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . 3.1622776601683795
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth . 1.8632463119315603
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs . 4.216965034285822
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 1.396135390856794
Collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . 4.641588833612778
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth ! 3.593813663804627
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . 3.359818286283782
The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for <UNK> as may be <UNK> to himself and not offensive to his patron . 1.8329807108324359
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . 1.4330125702369627
" I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . " " Perhaps I do . 2.0092330025650473
The <UNK> was <UNK> to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so <UNK> a <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . 2.4244620170823286
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus <UNK> my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to <UNK> your authority in my behalf . 1.5085907086001784
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 1.53174046370208
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly <UNK> at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 2.346228848142263
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <UNK> him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 1.615598098439874
It is impossible for me to be impartial . 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself <UNK> watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . 1.9684194472866121
Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> . 1.7301957388458942
The day passed much as the day before had done . 5.878016072274914
" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . " Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . 1.4977474763452014
It must be his own doing . He is his own master . 4.641588833612778
She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . 1.8957356524063758
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and <UNK> to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head . 1.9684194472866121
They <UNK> every attempt of Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? 2.8480358684358014
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . 2.2122162910704493
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s <UNK> in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . 1.4873521072935114
But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . " " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother . 1.7534865500829584
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 2.51188643150958
The party did not supply much conversation . 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Her <UNK> wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . 4.641588833612778
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . 3.359818286283782
Catherine , weak <UNK> , irritable , and completely under Lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self <UNK> and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . 1.778279410038923
Her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 2.8480358684358014
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it . 3.593813663804627
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 3.8746751204561316
Pemberley was now Georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . 2.51188643150958
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . 2.346228848142263
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no <UNK> the frequent mention of Wickham ' s name . 2.610157215682537
" I should never have said Mrs . 10.000000000000002
I can recal nothing worse . 17.78279410038923
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . 4.216965034285822
Their fortune on both sides is splendid . 10.000000000000002
What do you keep winking at me for ? 8.11130830789687
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said . 1.8632463119315603
You have done all this ! 17.78279410038923
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 1.425102670302998
At length the Parsonage was <UNK> . 12.915496650148839
Of course , we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg tm name associated with the work . 1.5848931924611136
I hope we may often meet again . " Elizabeth smiled . 5.179474679231212
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . 3.359818286283782
In that case he would return no more . 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth did all she could , to <UNK> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 1.242623671911505
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 1.9684194472866121
Society has claims on us all ; and I <UNK> myself one of those who consider intervals of <UNK> and amusement as desirable for every body . " Elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak <UNK> to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from <UNK> a <UNK> either from the <UNK> , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by <UNK> to dance . 1.1890167424419895
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam . 3.8746751204561316
If he had been <UNK> before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity <UNK> could make him . 1.5441135899948315
Gardiner smiled . 100.00000000000004
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . 1.615598098439874
Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time . 2.4244620170823286
YOU AGREE THAT YOU <UNK> NO <UNK> FOR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . F . . YOU AGREE THAT THE <UNK> , THE <UNK> <UNK> , AND ANY <UNK> <UNK> THIS <UNK> <UNK> NOT <UNK> <UNK> TO YOU FOR <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> DAMAGES <UNK> <UNK> YOU <UNK> <UNK> OF THE <UNK> OF <UNK> <UNK> . 1.3433993325989002
The visit was returned in due form . 10.000000000000002
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 2.4244620170823286
CHAPTER <UNK> . 100.00000000000004
" Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal <UNK> , you last night laid to my charge . 2.346228848142263
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . " " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . 1.53174046370208
Who should suffer but myself ? 17.78279410038923
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . 2.51188643150958
What a fine thing for our girls ! " " How so ? 4.641588833612778
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . " " For heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr . Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . " Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . 1.3485595530525598
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 4.216965034285822
I want to talk very seriously . 12.915496650148839
I shall be back by dinner . " " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . 1.3153690504363762
I send no compliments to your mother . 10.000000000000002
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . 5.179474679231212
Most earnestly did she <UNK> to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . 2.51188643150958
I came to try you . 17.78279410038923
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia . 2.0092330025650473
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been <UNK> by long expectations . 2.9935772947204895
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <UNK> every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were <UNK> abroad . 1.6876124757881477
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . 5.878016072274914
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! 3.593813663804627
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG <UNK> PRIDE AND PREJUDICE This file should be named . <UNK> or . <UNK> This and all associated files of various formats will be found in <UNK> <UNK> editions will <UNK> the previous one the old editions will be <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 2.610157215682537
He does not want abilities . 17.78279410038923
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his <UNK> when he speaks . 3.8746751204561316
Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . 3.593813663804627
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . 2.7213387683753076
how I laughed ! 46.415888336127786
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his <UNK> . 1.8329807108324359
" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . 1.5085907086001784
He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these <UNK> had arisen his principal <UNK> . 2.8480358684358014
Wickham is safe . " " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . " " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane . 1.4497406703726319
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may <UNK> to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund . 2.4244620170823286
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . 12.915496650148839
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . 2.51188643150958
Let the other young ladies have time to <UNK> . " Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . <UNK> of the party were now applied to . 1.4873521072935114
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 5.878016072274914
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ? 4.641588833612778
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . 5.878016072274914
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy ! 4.641588833612778
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . 3.1622776601683795
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 1.4773776525985112
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ? 4.641588833612778
Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . 4.216965034285822
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 1.632172128563275
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 2.7213387683753076
Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to <UNK> . 1.778279410038923
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the <UNK> property of some one or other of their daughters . 1.5441135899948315
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side . 5.179474679231212
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 2.9935772947204895
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being <UNK> by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled . 1.41011239906908
Then pray speak aloud . 26.82695795279726
They agree with me in <UNK> that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the <UNK> of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself <UNK> says , will connect themselves with such a family . 1.6681005372000588
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . 4.216965034285822
What is to become of us ! 12.915496650148839
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 3.8746751204561316
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome . 1.7301957388458942
<UNK> and pride are different things , though the words are often used <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 2.346228848142263
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . " " <UNK> their income ! 2.9935772947204895
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 1.778279410038923
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . 1.53174046370208
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 2.1017480113324885
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 2.154434690031884
But here he was set right by Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Their first subject was the <UNK> of the Rosings party . " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . 1.7082763938087104
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 5.179474679231212
" Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 1.8329807108324359
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 1.6496480740980204
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did . 1.5998587196060583
It seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary <UNK> , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . 1.615598098439874
Gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , <UNK> of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 1.2843862635897427
My watchfulness has been <UNK> ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I <UNK> in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance . 1.7534865500829584
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 4.216965034285822
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 1.557068404753731
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were <UNK> in her favour . 1.4330125702369627
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> ! 2.7213387683753076
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! 4.641588833612778
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . 2.610157215682537
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . 2.7213387683753076
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 2.4244620170823286
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at <UNK> ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . 1.6681005372000588
" There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London . 1.632172128563275
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy ' s meditated elopement . 3.8746751204561316
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 2.4244620170823286
F . 316.22776601683796
Mr . Darcy replied with great <UNK> , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley . 2.4244620170823286
Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> . 3.593813663804627
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . 1.8047217668271702
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . 2.610157215682537
" But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy . 1.5441135899948315
They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <UNK> <UNK> and head <UNK> there is not much the matter with me . 1.7082763938087104
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 5.179474679231212
By Mrs . 100.00000000000004
Elizabeth <UNK> the next morning to the same thoughts and <UNK> which had at length closed her eyes . 2.9935772947204895
<UNK> my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . 5.878016072274914
Elizabeth hoped she had <UNK> him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 2.346228848142263
<UNK> any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . " " Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . 1.2560585988318853
She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477
There is one point , on which I want your advice . 5.179474679231212
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 5.878016072274914
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 1.28792362543363
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 10.000000000000002
Reynolds could interest her on no other point . 8.11130830789687
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . 1.8632463119315603
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 1.5441135899948315
She answered with equal indifference and <UNK> , and the other said no more . 3.8746751204561316
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 3.359818286283782
But who was your mother ? 17.78279410038923
" Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . " " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . " " Oh ! 1.7534865500829584
My sisters may write to me . 12.915496650148839
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . " " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " " Has your governess left you ? " " We never had any governess . " " No governess ! 1.5199110829529336
single , my dear , to be sure ! 8.11130830789687
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . 5.179474679231212
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay . 3.1622776601683795
Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in <UNK> , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and <UNK> a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire . 1.2505106035854068
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse . 8.11130830789687
Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her . 5.179474679231212
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away . 1.8957356524063758
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . 1.9684194472866121
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 1.8957356524063758
They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins ' s admiration . 4.216965034285822
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 5.878016072274914
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 2.610157215682537
Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . 5.179474679231212
<UNK> there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or <UNK> . 2.610157215682537
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can ' t write ; so I will <UNK> , and you write for me . 1.9684194472866121
CHAPTER XIII . 100.00000000000004
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 2.154434690031884
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . 1.8632463119315603
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 1.1954168684575872
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . 2.9935772947204895
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 1.8957356524063758
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 10.000000000000002
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . 4.641588833612778
I could hardly keep my countenance . 12.915496650148839
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 1.557068404753731
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 1.6681005372000588
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . 3.359818286283782
It was to be such a secret ! " " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject . 2.0535250264571463
" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? 5.179474679231212
It became her turn to listen . 12.915496650148839
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it . 2.4244620170823286
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 3.1622776601683795
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . 2.2758459260747883
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . 5.179474679231212
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? 5.878016072274914
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? 2.610157215682537
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ' s beauty . 3.593813663804627
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . 5.878016072274914
" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . 2.610157215682537
I was given good <UNK> , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 3.593813663804627
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . 2.346228848142263
I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too . 4.216965034285822
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of <UNK> for them . 2.2122162910704493
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . " It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . 1.7082763938087104
She <UNK> from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . 1.6496480740980204
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . 1.4773776525985112
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the <UNK> of red <UNK> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 1.8047217668271702
He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . 3.1622776601683795
It was a large , well <UNK> room , handsomely fitted up . 4.641588833612778
The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate . 3.359818286283782
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! 1.221677348996792
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <UNK> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . 1.4497406703726319
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 1.2648552168552962
Bennet , who <UNK> with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be <UNK> enough . 1.6496480740980204
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . 5.179474679231212
Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately . 8.11130830789687
They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . 3.8746751204561316
His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 2.51188643150958
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 1.778279410038923
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 2.1017480113324885
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 1.615598098439874
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest <UNK> ; his <UNK> contracted , his air gloomy . 2.2122162910704493
" I do not get on at all . 8.11130830789687
I . 316.22776601683796
<UNK> and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was <UNK> and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . 1.9684194472866121
Could there be finer symptoms ? 17.78279410038923
Your <UNK> makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a <UNK> . " " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! 1.7082763938087104
I am very , very sorry . 12.915496650148839
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . 2.8480358684358014
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . 2.51188643150958
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 3.8746751204561316
The <UNK> of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . 2.2122162910704493
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 1.7082763938087104
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of <UNK> them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <UNK> , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the <UNK> kind . " She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <UNK> by any feeling of <UNK> . 1.2915496650148839
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and <UNK> pass away . 1.8632463119315603
The housekeeper came ; a respectable looking , <UNK> woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . 2.154434690031884
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 10.000000000000002
The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 1.6496480740980204
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 2.2122162910704493
Where shall you change horses ? Oh ! 10.000000000000002
This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . 2.7213387683753076
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . 2.0535250264571463
" How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! " cried Lydia . 5.179474679231212
I guessed as much . " And though he exclaimed at the <UNK> , she found that it had been pretty much the case . 2.346228848142263
He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . " " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . 1.8957356524063758
The Foundation ' s <UNK> or federal tax <UNK> number is . 5.179474679231212
Oh , no . " " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . " " No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . " " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . " She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . 1.338388753173757
Illustration A <UNK> <UNK> . PRIDE AND PREJUDICE A Novel . 5.878016072274914
Three daughters married ! 46.415888336127786
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> . 1.8329807108324359
But I must write no more . 12.915496650148839
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? 1.4773776525985112
His belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 1.6681005372000588
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . 3.359818286283782
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . " However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather <UNK> , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . 1.4977474763452014
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . 3.8746751204561316
But of course she did not mention my name to you . " " Yes , she did . " " And what did she say ? " " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well . 1.5998587196060583
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 2.9935772947204895
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 2.0535250264571463
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . 1.6876124757881477
Every body declared that he was the <UNK> young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always <UNK> the appearance of his goodness . 1.93069772888325
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
But you are always giving her the preference . " " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . " " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? 1.41011239906908
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of <UNK> to others . 2.346228848142263
. F . . Some states do not allow <UNK> of certain implied <UNK> or the exclusion or limitation of certain <UNK> of damages . 2.346228848142263
I write rather slowly . " " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! 2.51188643150958
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good <UNK> engaged Mr . Collins ' s conversation to herself . 2.1017480113324885
Did you see it ? " Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . 3.359818286283782
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . 5.179474679231212
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 1.615598098439874
Teaze him laugh at him . <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . " " But upon my honour I do not . 2.0092330025650473
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 2.2758459260747883
Did he know of their intending to go off ? 6.812920690579612
" When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! I who knew what he was . 2.0092330025650473
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it <UNK> . 1.5441135899948315
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . 3.1622776601683795
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . 1.778279410038923
The next was in these words . 12.915496650148839
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 1.324192791886045
When they were all in the drawing room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . 1.8047217668271702
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . 3.8746751204561316
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 1.615598098439874
" I hope , " added Mrs . 10.000000000000002
END OF THE <UNK> <UNK> . 17.78279410038923
<UNK> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all . 1.6496480740980204
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . 2.346228848142263
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself . 1.7534865500829584
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . 3.359818286283782
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over . 2.2758459260747883
" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried Jane . 3.593813663804627

My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them . 4.641588833612778
how I wanted you ! " " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . " " Certainly . 1.7534865500829584
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . 1.4977474763452014
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . 6.812920690579612
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . 2.8480358684358014
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . 1.8329807108324359
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 1.338388753173757
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 2.154434690031884
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 2.610157215682537
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . 3.359818286283782
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 1.4873521072935114
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . 1.7301957388458942
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . 3.593813663804627
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 1.8632463119315603
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 1.7534865500829584
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 2.154434690031884
Without a governess you must have been neglected . " " <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . 1.8632463119315603
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 1.6496480740980204
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means <UNK> or <UNK> , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . 1.5441135899948315
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
<UNK> spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother in law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . 1.557068404753731
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . 1.53174046370208
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <UNK> . 1.5998587196060583
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her <UNK> . 1.5706464294715548
You know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . 3.1622776601683795
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 3.359818286283782
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 2.346228848142263
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the <UNK> , but of that I <UNK> . 1.7534865500829584
The second began . 46.415888336127786
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 6.812920690579612
Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <UNK> and <UNK> father ; and though he belonged to one of the <UNK> , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 1.3830728955554412
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . " Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs . 1.8957356524063758
They will take care not to <UNK> their income . 6.812920690579612
At such a distance as that , you know , things are <UNK> misrepresented . " " Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips . 2.2122162910704493
" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . 3.8746751204561316
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 1.338388753173757
Shall you like to have such a brother ? " " Very , very much . 3.593813663804627
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 1.7082763938087104
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew . 5.878016072274914
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 3.8746751204561316
" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! 3.359818286283782
And is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? 4.641588833612778
Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 2.8480358684358014
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . 1.93069772888325
" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr . Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing after all . I consider it as one of the first <UNK> of polished societies . " " Certainly , Sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in <UNK> amongst the less polished societies of the world . Every <UNK> can dance . " Sir William only smiled . 1.365007806546014
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you . 1.5998587196060583
You must not disappoint your father . " " My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . " " Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . " " Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . 1.5848931924611136
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . 5.179474679231212
He heard her with astonishment . 17.78279410038923
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 12.915496650148839
Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 5.179474679231212
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 1.1659144011798317
We now come to the point . 12.915496650148839
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature . 2.9935772947204895
Is nothing due to me on that score ? 8.11130830789687
Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . 4.216965034285822
I did not expect such a compliment . " " Did not you ? 4.216965034285822
Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in <UNK> . 2.1017480113324885
But you know married women have never much time for writing . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 1.6681005372000588
" This is wholly unexpected . 17.78279410038923
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . 10.000000000000002
" Your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . 5.179474679231212
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . 2.7213387683753076
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 1.8047217668271702
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . 4.216965034285822
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . " " I see no occasion for that . 1.8047217668271702
My youngest sister has left all her friends has <UNK> ; has thrown herself into the power of of Mr . Wickham . 2.51188643150958
The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 1.615598098439874
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild <UNK> of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . 1.6876124757881477
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . 1.3830728955554412
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general . 3.593813663804627
Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s sufferings . 2.1017480113324885
Royalty payments must be paid within days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your <UNK> tax returns . 2.346228848142263
" He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . 1.3894954943731377
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . 1.8047217668271702
Miss Bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs . 4.216965034285822
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . 1.8957356524063758
I know we dine with four and twenty families . " Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could <UNK> Bingley to keep his countenance . 2.4244620170823286
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was Elizabeth ' s intimate friend . 2.51188643150958
As no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins ' s scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . 2.0092330025650473
Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <UNK> at whist , enumerating all the <UNK> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he <UNK> his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . 1.5706464294715548
CHAPTER XVIII . 100.00000000000004
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily <UNK> seeing him , till after the departure of the former . 1.8632463119315603
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . " " If I were as rich as Mr . Darcy , " cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , " I should not care how proud I was . 1.5199110829529336
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different <UNK> ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . 2.346228848142263
<UNK> recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
I am perfectly satisfied . 26.82695795279726
She shared in their attendance on Mrs . 10.000000000000002
The Foundation is <UNK> to complying with the laws <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> donations in all states of the United States . 2.610157215682537
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . 5.179474679231212
It was at Sir William Lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . 3.593813663804627
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother ' s schemes . 1.5998587196060583
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 1.2096079377043663
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . 8.11130830789687
The <UNK> or <UNK> of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . " She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . " Again his astonishment was <UNK> ; and he looked at her with an expression of <UNK> incredulity and mortification . 1.1547819846894583
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . 3.8746751204561316
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 2.8480358684358014
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . 2.346228848142263
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . 3.359818286283782

Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . 1.7301957388458942
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 1.2401035305418566
<UNK> , selfish girl ! 26.82695795279726
A small sum could not do all this . " " No , " said her father , " Wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a <UNK> less than ten thousand pounds . 1.778279410038923
do any thing rather than marry without affection . 8.11130830789687
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 1.615598098439874
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr . Darcy ' s steward . 1.2809343786525484
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission . 2.2758459260747883
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . 3.1622776601683795
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 1.353876180022544
The pause was to Elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . 6.812920690579612
Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 2.2758459260747883
here comes Hill . 46.415888336127786
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law . " The loss of her daughter made Mrs . 2.2758459260747883
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . 2.4244620170823286
Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ? 2.4244620170823286
There ' s for you ! 17.78279410038923
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . 4.641588833612778
Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . " " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . 1.5998587196060583
<UNK> <UNK> the face of Mrs . 12.915496650148839
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever <UNK> , and the <UNK> friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . 1.5085907086001784
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . 3.359818286283782
" They are going to be <UNK> near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! 2.346228848142263
The evening passed quietly , <UNK> by any thing extraordinary . 5.878016072274914
Their powers of conversation were considerable . 12.915496650148839
I am not <UNK> you know . 12.915496650148839
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 1.5848931924611136
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new <UNK> . 2.2758459260747883
I have a high respect for your nerves . 8.11130830789687
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
Her colour changed , and she said no more . 6.812920690579612
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . " <UNK> by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did . 1.4330125702369627
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . But good lord ! 2.8480358684358014
This Mrs . 100.00000000000004
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good <UNK> will <UNK> it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth <UNK> lest her mother should be exposing herself again . 1.5706464294715548
He is a pleasant fellow , and would <UNK> you <UNK> . " " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 2.154434690031884
You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " " You mistake me , my dear . 3.1622776601683795

That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <UNK> in town , as Mr . Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . 1.4030037231905736
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . " " Your first <UNK> is false . 2.0535250264571463
His doing so drew her notice . 12.915496650148839
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . 1.6876124757881477
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <UNK> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . 2.154434690031884
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be <UNK> to you to let them go alone . " " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " " Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . 1.4030037231905736
Poor dear child ! 46.415888336127786
I have not been accustomed to such language as this . 5.878016072274914
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair . 1.7082763938087104
Never mind Miss Lizzy ' s hair . " " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . " " Oh ! 1.5441135899948315
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . 1.425102670302998
What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . 2.51188643150958
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? " Nothing less than the complaisance of a <UNK> could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most <UNK> courtesy . 1.3153690504363762
With <UNK> tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of <UNK> that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . 1.778279410038923
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . 8.11130830789687
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his <UNK> were at the same time so vague and <UNK> , that her mother , though often <UNK> , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . 1.6496480740980204
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . 3.359818286283782
Oh ! 316.22776601683796
By this time she is actually with them ! 8.11130830789687
Kitty <UNK> and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . 4.641588833612778
I will think no more about him . " Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth . 1.632172128563275
Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very <UNK> too for it is provoking me to <UNK> , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly . 1.365007806546014
If this be the case , he deserves you . 6.812920690579612
Their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse . 3.593813663804627
Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed . 1.3768571648527583
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . 2.0092330025650473
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . 2.2122162910704493
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . 2.51188643150958
Hart was the <UNK> of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone . 2.4244620170823286
I will leave him to himself . " In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . 1.6681005372000588
This room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . 2.51188643150958
Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . 3.593813663804627
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were <UNK> to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . 1.4174741629268053
Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better . 8.11130830789687
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so <UNK> courted you . 1.557068404753731
You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in <UNK> those kind of schemes , and <UNK> a person of their <UNK> contempt . 1.6496480740980204
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my <UNK> and care . 2.1017480113324885
Let me mend it for you . 12.915496650148839
I don ' t know . 17.78279410038923
Bennet , having <UNK> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . 1.4585940117250362
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . 1.6876124757881477
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a <UNK> library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read <UNK> . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose <UNK> ' s <UNK> . 1.3830728955554412
This son was to join in <UNK> off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . 1.8957356524063758
Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 2.0535250264571463
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> . 1.9684194472866121
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 2.9935772947204895
While these <UNK> born notions were passing in their <UNK> , the perturbation of Elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . 2.51188643150958
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . 1.6681005372000588
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 1.4677992676220695
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 2.0535250264571463
The first part of Mrs . 17.78279410038923
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very <UNK> reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to <UNK> and <UNK> to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 1.1747083882399671
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon <UNK> up every private care ; and covering her face with her <UNK> , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . 1.2195704601594413
Indeed he has no improper pride . 12.915496650148839
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . 5.179474679231212
But that is not the case here . 10.000000000000002
<UNK> wore a happier aspect . 17.78279410038923
You have employed your time much better . 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman <UNK> the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . 1.3894954943731377
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . 5.179474679231212
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . " " And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? " " The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . 1.3433993325989002
" Well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? 2.1017480113324885
I know it to be impossible . " " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! 3.593813663804627
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing . 2.0535250264571463
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> . 2.1017480113324885
Elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . 2.51188643150958
But when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ' s <UNK> all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 1.557068404753731
The extravagance and general <UNK> which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 1.8047217668271702
" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr . Darcy ? " " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . " " I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . 1.2505106035854068

Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . 1.4873521072935114
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private <UNK> in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of <UNK> with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . 1.425102670302998

" Excuse my interference . It was kindly meant . " " <UNK> girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . 1.7301957388458942
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . 2.0535250264571463
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 2.610157215682537
" So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find . 2.7213387683753076
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . 2.7213387683753076
<UNK> on Jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy ' s explanation , by <UNK> Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 1.7534865500829584
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 2.2758459260747883
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 2.610157215682537
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband . 1.5441135899948315
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
What are you telling Miss Bennet ? 12.915496650148839
There can be no love in all this . 8.11130830789687
She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 1.632172128563275

Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 1.8329807108324359
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time . 2.7213387683753076
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . " She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . 1.7082763938087104
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . 5.878016072274914
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . 4.216965034285822
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of <UNK> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . 1.6496480740980204
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with <UNK> all the <UNK> explanations . 2.610157215682537
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . 5.179474679231212
Oh , brother , how kind you are ! 8.11130830789687
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . " " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . " To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <UNK> of an elegant female . 1.16957266874034
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 1.9684194472866121
But are you pleased , Jane ? 12.915496650148839
" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . " He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very <UNK> thing , and called out to her , " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr . Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain . 1.102943311791613
" I am all astonishment . 17.78279410038923
On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and told her with great <UNK> that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . 1.4497406703726319

If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . " The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they <UNK> satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had <UNK> Mrs . 1.3830728955554412

My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " CHAPTER <UNK> . 1.6496480740980204
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . 1.3768571648527583
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 1.3894954943731377
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 2.0535250264571463
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other . 3.1622776601683795
Her performance on the piano forte is <UNK> . " " It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . " " All young ladies accomplished ! 1.615598098439874
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the <UNK> girls in the country . 1.6876124757881477
And pray what sort of <UNK> do you make ? 6.812920690579612

She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 1.6876124757881477
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate . 1.7082763938087104

Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . 1.93069772888325
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . " " Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . 1.5706464294715548
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 2.0092330025650473
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . 2.51188643150958
" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . 1.6496480740980204

While Sir William was with them , Mr .

More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr . Darcy . She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! Yet it did , and even a third . 1.3111339374215643

When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and <UNK> the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 1.2775649214671148
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . 3.593813663804627

Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 2.9935772947204895
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 2.8480358684358014
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . 2.610157215682537

Now what have you to say ? " " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . " Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . 1.4873521072935114
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . 2.2758459260747883
I ought not to have said a word about it . 5.878016072274914
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 3.1622776601683795
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . 2.51188643150958
" How strange this is ! 17.78279410038923
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the <UNK> , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 1.396135390856794
She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . Mr . Darcy said very little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all . 1.5998587196060583
Elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several <UNK> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . 1.365007806546014

At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! 1.5441135899948315
why is not every body as happy ? " Elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . 1.9684194472866121
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ' s <UNK> had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or <UNK> in him . 1.6496480740980204
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . 2.8480358684358014
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . 6.812920690579612

She does not yet leave her dressing room . 8.11130830789687
But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 1.6876124757881477
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . 2.51188643150958
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 26.82695795279726
His character was decided . 26.82695795279726
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 2.154434690031884
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . " " I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . " " Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . " " That is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . 1.353876180022544
It is almost past belief . 17.78279410038923
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had <UNK> time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 1.4585940117250362
My dear Mr . Bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? 3.1622776601683795
my dear , " continued Mrs . 12.915496650148839
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . 1.1671161911100678
" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . " " You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! If my vanity had taken a <UNK> turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <UNK> . " On Miss Lucas ' s <UNK> , however , she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . " And gravely glancing at Mr . Darcy , " There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with ' <UNK> your breath to cool your <UNK> , ' and I shall keep mine to <UNK> my song . " Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . 1.1423612637190086

Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . 1.557068404753731
" You are <UNK> , Lizzy . 12.915496650148839
You may have drawn him in . " " If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . " " Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? 1.8632463119315603
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 316.22776601683796
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the <UNK> light , seemed most improbable . 2.9935772947204895
Does he know his real character ? " " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . 2.2758459260747883
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral <UNK> from the evil before them . 2.8480358684358014
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 3.8746751204561316
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention . 4.641588833612778
Not a soul knew of it , but <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
He was well , but so much engaged with Mr . Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . 2.8480358684358014
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . " " Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly . 1.8632463119315603
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . 5.179474679231212
Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the <UNK> ? 1.778279410038923
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <UNK> recommendation , and to assert that I had <UNK> all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . 1.53174046370208
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the <UNK> . 1.4677992676220695
Her ease and good spirits increased . 12.915496650148839
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 2.9935772947204895
They came . 100.00000000000004
I had not believed it possible . " " I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth . 3.1622776601683795
I never saw such a long <UNK> in my life . 5.878016072274914
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his <UNK> , all honoured with the <UNK> of <UNK> , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . 1.8329807108324359
Yet he is such a man ! " " Yes , yes , they must marry . 3.359818286283782
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . 1.4174741629268053
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for <UNK> Lodge , the <UNK> are dreadful . " Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . 1.7534865500829584
Bennet , " that is very unlucky . " " Can I have the carriage ? " said Jane . 2.8480358684358014
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished <UNK> of integrity or benevolence , that might <UNK> him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the <UNK> of virtue , atone for those <UNK> errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . 1.3830728955554412
" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " His misfortunes ! " repeated Darcy <UNK> ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . " " And of your <UNK> , " cried Elizabeth with energy . 1.5441135899948315
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " Oh ! " cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted . 1.8329807108324359
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . 1.778279410038923
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 1.778279410038923
They could describe an entertainment with <UNK> , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . 2.610157215682537
" You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age . " " I am not one and twenty . " When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . 1.5848931924611136
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . 4.216965034285822
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s <UNK> name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father ' s estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think . 1.2648552168552962
what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . 1.6496480740980204
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is <UNK> the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken <UNK> , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . 1.2742749857031337
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were <UNK> of dejection . 1.7301957388458942
" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . 4.641588833612778
Mr . Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . 2.346228848142263
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . " " Indeed ! " " Yes the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> . 1.3830728955554412
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him . 3.593813663804627
Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . " " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget . 1.425102670302998
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . 1.8329807108324359
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . 1.557068404753731
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking . 2.2122162910704493
Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father . 1.6681005372000588
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! 5.878016072274914
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 2.2122162910704493
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . 2.0092330025650473
" My dear <UNK> , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of <UNK> each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s t te t te between two women can never end without a quarrel . 1.4677992676220695
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 2.4244620170823286
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 5.878016072274914
But does not Jane <UNK> with the sister ? 8.11130830789687
<UNK> it be so ? " " Oh , lord ! 5.878016072274914
I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . 3.1622776601683795
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . " Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less <UNK> of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too <UNK> by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . 1.2809343786525484
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . 5.878016072274914
I am glad he <UNK> here on Tuesday . 8.11130830789687
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane . 1.9684194472866121
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him . 1.2238249369681928

If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart , the owner of the Project Gutenberg tm trademark . 1.4412195967188537
She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . 1.4873521072935114
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . 1.6681005372000588
Poor little Lizzy ! 46.415888336127786
Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes . 1.8957356524063758
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . 1.353876180022544
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <UNK> , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 2.154434690031884
" Wickham so very bad ! 17.78279410038923
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . 5.878016072274914
Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and <UNK> passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . 1.4585940117250362
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 2.2758459260747883
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her . 2.2122162910704493
" I never heard any thing so abominable . 8.11130830789687
Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ' s <UNK> enough to <UNK> him from its <UNK> , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never <UNK> without him . " " So much the better . 1.4497406703726319
<UNK> me in silence . 26.82695795279726
There is no indignity so <UNK> to their feelings ! " She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " " And quite alone ? 1.4412195967188537
She then <UNK> again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . " " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . " " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something <UNK> <UNK> in the usual <UNK> of such a meeting . 1.121375965942693
I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
Elizabeth took up some <UNK> , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . 2.7213387683753076
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . 1.5441135899948315
If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was <UNK> done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . With respect to that other , more <UNK> <UNK> , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only <UNK> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 1.353876180022544
Every thing <UNK> what is strong already . 10.000000000000002
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation . 2.610157215682537
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 2.0535250264571463
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . 2.2122162910704493
It is too long ago . 17.78279410038923
" She is so fond of Mrs . 10.000000000000002
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever . " Darcy was fixed in astonishment . 2.2122162910704493
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . 1.632172128563275
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of <UNK> . " He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . 1.3593563908785256
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . 2.346228848142263
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 4.216965034285822
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , soon collected them round the table . 1.7082763938087104
" You forget that I have made no answer . 6.812920690579612
Bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . 2.7213387683753076
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise . 1.242623671911505
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips . 4.216965034285822
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half expectation which Mrs . 2.610157215682537
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 4.641588833612778
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . 2.610157215682537
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 1.4585940117250362
No sentiment of shame gave a <UNK> to her triumph . 5.878016072274914
" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? " " To morrow fortnight . " " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . 1.8957356524063758
