My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs . 1511.8931029024836
She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . 2097.602287049112
We have not met since the th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . " Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when <UNK> to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn . 1982.412146206561
I never was . 2009.8273784522669
When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . " " Your plan is a good one , " replied Elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . 1922.8872912001448
But it was not to be . 7418.494454742295
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . 1520.3159856773607
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . " " Oh ! 1447.2055634259184
He replied , and was again silent . 2732.2686677893603
Hurst and Miss Bingley . 384.87460238737054
what has she to do with it ? 7371.791440031678
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of <UNK> should not be broken in on . 2534.4957949263608
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and <UNK> . 2703.7514378034175

Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 1452.276286507133
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever . " Darcy was fixed in astonishment . 2032.972007768953
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 1087.5725364063894
Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical . 3640.2469723043077
This son was to join in <UNK> off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . 2383.951697568922
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . 2850.7809551028695
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband . 1350.6917930648876
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 2672.1521657518924
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , <UNK> against the <UNK> conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . 1533.682048622188
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long . 1462.479871367903
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . 3034.1387455850922
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . 1459.1884562173902
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . 1152.5982220850942
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 1308.7535059053198
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity . 1797.2849660035686
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the <UNK> old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . 2102.8393020685653
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was <UNK> her feelings in <UNK> on Elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . 1416.1969614357351
" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she . 3577.59176756892
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . " As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . 1652.7062373449576
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . 1460.1460567416193
It was unpardonable . 5152.638743472365
He was my <UNK> , and excessively attached to me . 4602.162431852093
Yes , I call it a very easy distance . " " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth . 1642.5540320985474
Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . 1951.6027096979367
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 1530.8832931286743
Elizabeth , <UNK> all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . 1765.0451207040055
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 2273.9940382329455
The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . 2204.0688709019296
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is <UNK> . " " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs . 2939.0914415656653
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . 1229.486264334777
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <UNK> in the gaieties which that season generally <UNK> , and that your <UNK> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall <UNK> you . " " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . " " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . " " Why will you think so ? 2600.9818379894546
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 1743.0633514397232
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . 1611.2282045462607
But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . 2878.8605000999396
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my <UNK> and care . 2069.3200510808297
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . 1806.9567798409919
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 1459.5234320080576
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 783.1300864312926
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 2475.763405231081
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? 2434.899461020532
I congratulate her . 4581.415692442863
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 1405.0637336451957
I must have employment and society . 1510.240894050249
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more <UNK> , and less <UNK> than the other had ever seen him . 2333.4815722941426
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . " Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where Mrs . 1901.2254103749992
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by <UNK> the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . 1297.006869060503
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . 1272.4707873799643
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <UNK> . " " And this is your real opinion ! 1769.7540647639523
Mr . what ' s his name . 2055.1537319736876
No , no , let me <UNK> for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret . 1555.5377553368105
I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . " " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <UNK> of you . 1193.5491247091777
" Oh , Lizzy ! 1222.1165231215955
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a <UNK> table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the <UNK> of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . 1750.0239401418032
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at <UNK> , and Mrs . 950.1972369491934
" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . " While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . 2023.42238567245
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! 2000.0456059561452
It must be an amusing study . " " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing . 2842.1202972700116
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . " He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 2355.3544147407483
" And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 1097.8067597382476
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley ' s behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . 1448.578373558345
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . 1176.5341724670438
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . 2054.0108262417134
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 4483.589124135473
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . 1300.1856342380634
Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by <UNK> to his sister . 1342.2102529290453
Lady Catherine ' s great attentions to Mrs . 517.4193916171771
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . <UNK> staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . 1372.7724738397458
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 2530.8304120344515
All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . 1839.654940197085
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . 1605.2136777212718
CHAPTER XI . 1263.0515403986196
Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . 1908.3300653629256
They agreed that Mrs . 1389.338601216828
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to <UNK> , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to <UNK> his prosperous love . 2096.97040379788
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 2346.8684493944675
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . 1085.1972164975625
He readily agreed to it . 2950.0258329228436
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . 1994.2145577939177
But enough of this . 2967.6165356222173
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . 1855.7225216365302
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . 1452.8102436631198
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of <UNK> them . 1856.7930466568625
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 1271.910698464468
. 10045.397617124398
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . 2209.3296379243575
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . 3397.458859309463
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 1412.4549199961375
Philips . The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . 1901.139261542014
Her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 1585.5351082500006
The second began . 1203.4966212948273
I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . 1866.760689160886
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . 1621.07444707504
END OF VOL . 3852.496032562316
You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . 1556.275563339539
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 1588.7799977520576
Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s sufferings . 1908.104364807105
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly <UNK> , she seated herself . 1806.9580733001421
She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs . 849.0461789600936
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! 1740.2731133561597
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his <UNK> were at the same time so vague and <UNK> , that her mother , though often <UNK> , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . 1644.0168964313816
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 2571.4395707395574
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . 2200.5399114708825
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral <UNK> from the evil before them . 2276.5572747929778
Again she read on . 3567.786372175467
<UNK> back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write <UNK> . 2414.041912344262
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 2814.493885286429
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 2030.2023731374472
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 2290.155095949189
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . 1946.7057016500357
Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . " Mr . Bennet made no answer . 1959.6649074052302
CHAPTER IX . 1263.0515403986196
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . 2001.3195215265357
Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> . 2387.7863923093632
Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 1739.0857073272766
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the per <UNK> . 1549.5780363274841
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister ' s being in town . 1281.6362583199482
Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph . 2367.5936933562684
my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 1285.552368207951
Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs . 2200.0203021229513
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? " " Most willingly . " " You shall have it in few words . 3113.998203132803
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 769.4023284186402
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . 2852.3935309781996
I do not know who is good enough for him . " Mr . and Mrs . 1394.7273007658075
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . 2266.678080403675
Bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . 1664.697449585265
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . 1654.530331409704
While these <UNK> born notions were passing in their <UNK> , the perturbation of Elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . 1956.2991021975142
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . 550.72621300887
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1658.3123945413458
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies . 2520.5054240600616
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . 1314.3185174143393
Never mind Miss Lizzy ' s hair . " " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . " " Oh ! 1481.7214231865735
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do ! 3404.7390998561445
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . 1577.7875042246067
Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 1161.0616742599962
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and <UNK> them up , though as she never came without <UNK> some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or <UNK> , she seldom went away without leaving them more <UNK> than she found them . 1648.5759198165383
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . 1468.0513359993413
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 1985.9290436169645
I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a <UNK> up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 2484.5631737972226
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter . 1160.575550617883
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North . 2466.67328916851
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . 2017.0930058999177
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 2419.8253156369456
how can it affect them ? " " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! 2472.292959992949
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> . 1697.0829345059553
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . 3194.2708834588834
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . 1878.6382934506028
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 1457.844943546645
Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s <UNK> , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any <UNK> of sentiment . If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error . 2186.643868504205
" Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever <UNK> , that your resentment once created was <UNK> . 1444.2325114677635
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 2231.9984613946867
Five daughters <UNK> entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . 1300.1628062333673
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 1705.6280471063512
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 2617.789928210813
Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . 1336.2371316276524
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of <UNK> . " He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . 1841.3338024047746
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should <UNK> . 2719.2432955026543
And then we were so merry all the way home ! 2851.504149703579
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . 1717.0056725650954
<UNK> are too much like <UNK> . 1717.6226920330657
Not handsome enough to dance with ! 1371.5534429769032
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . 1950.5419158336535
When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . 1835.6745933714178
In a few minutes , Mrs . 1916.2295414321209
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . 2859.3606651339132
If you ' <UNK> believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 3250.0124419537497
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set <UNK> . 2277.3985863749
Gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . 1886.756334366576
Yours ever , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " With the officers ! " cried Lydia . 2492.798371482688
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 2132.754385330417
She is quite a little creature . 1241.4016134334568
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . 1327.4355441579105
They <UNK> every attempt of Mrs . 927.7273757183473
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 3713.6955888537586
" I am sure there is not on his . 4596.73519681397
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . 1174.9207952425693
But do not be cast down . 6340.96852039441
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . " " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . " " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . 2221.621943000904
I am going away myself . " " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . " And upon Elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr . Collins . " Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . 1862.247930082624
" You look pale . 2452.793164118545
No one but Mrs . 757.7991430523097
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . 1397.6017045494157
When Mrs . 1133.6359062803915
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 1461.5075815043338
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . 1443.3324413891958
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . 1845.7744869336118
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . " " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . 1404.5215541041803
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the <UNK> , and was soon out of sight . 2975.7662707874006
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . 790.7018282539774
" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . " " You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! If my vanity had taken a <UNK> turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <UNK> . " On Miss Lucas ' s <UNK> , however , she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . " And gravely glancing at Mr . Darcy , " There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with ' <UNK> your breath to cool your <UNK> , ' and I shall keep mine to <UNK> my song . " Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . 1979.5503014563276
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and <UNK> them , after a short <UNK> , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . 1913.6326898097093
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the <UNK> road . 1924.3283650140097
Such a disappointment ! 3740.710248688236
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . 1316.5558175719514
I promised them so <UNK> ! 4469.26025169907
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 2093.7245732108995
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . 1053.2604308904522
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . 1245.6538437883003
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 1639.662678419841
Pray forgive me , if I have been very <UNK> , or at least do not punish me so far , as to <UNK> me from <UNK> . 4262.03982883785
I hope you have destroyed the letter . 1943.6348228349775
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 2823.354476124811
. 10045.397617124398
Gardiner abused her stupidity . 1771.4526996874938
Where shall you change horses ? Oh ! 1123.8798026600844
" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . 1493.825953663492
" We can all plague and punish one another . 2103.997122970649
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . " Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . 1254.3330371123247
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . " She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . 1485.1345020427407

The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for <UNK> as may be <UNK> to himself and not offensive to his patron . 2309.884146687973
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . 1440.0107075988813
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . 3999.573349906496
I would keep a pack of <UNK> , and drink a bottle of wine every day . " " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . 1353.663902766312
I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . " " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . 1898.4068676508691
And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from <UNK> . 1649.5756126685988
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . " " If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . 2699.402111454492
At present we have nothing to guide us . 1344.7498235831777
I knew how it would be . 1717.2379433535498
CHAPTER XVII . 1263.0515403986196
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great <UNK> . 2947.384071389874
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
I wish I could see her . 771.5584294432654
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 2041.6495413307468
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ' s height , or rather <UNK> . " " How I long to see her again ! 1916.5671477377305
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it . 1502.2141224199918
And she was only sixteen last June . 2630.182733232593
Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at <UNK> , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs . 1213.8704663972699
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way . 1222.1744582907754
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . 690.290787724883
Have you seen any pleasant men ? 1576.0023702757705
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit . 2119.066240544388
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease . 2711.254925075955
" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? " " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . " " La ! " replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . 2568.1491757743147
CHAPTER I . 2004.9693439188225
Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 2402.650351259702
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . 2835.7398038325637
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . 1027.1521365787466
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 1563.9569279519342
Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 2109.8292495429614
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . Bingley was <UNK> to Darcy by the easiness , openness , <UNK> of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . 1755.0737322232574
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate . 1264.503920470412
" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! " said she . 2319.038960413989
All Meryton seemed striving to <UNK> the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . 2054.654088303316
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . 1157.9101680482838
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 2148.713792770764
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all <UNK> , if she <UNK> more , and could have the advantage of a London master . 1427.066153862117
Of course , we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg tm name associated with the work . 1055.575971720063
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better <UNK> room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . 1342.0655999696621
Mr . Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . 802.8089102027943
" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . 3337.8103013292953
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the <UNK> property of some one or other of their daughters . 1765.7608020503471
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 1393.1580223170577
What congratulations will then flow in ! 4086.280300903231
" Upon my word , " said Mrs . 956.6666005130481
has she any family ? " " She has one only daughter , the <UNK> of Rosings , and of very extensive property . " " Ah ! " cried Mrs . 2374.8067948849693
" You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . 1895.5018673562008
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this <UNK> recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy ! 1437.8209089606748
But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . 1359.102905020664
Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her . 1289.9476543140004
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London . 1095.1774184798783
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . 1792.8576827349737
You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg tm works . 1364.8217176302119
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . 1464.1546587330238
A person may be proud without being vain . 749.1663723302744
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object . 1159.5241304339481
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon <UNK> up every private care ; and covering her face with her <UNK> , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . 1798.2485403669232
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . 2338.6771609241364
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 1912.0189521136388
Bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . 737.8485008415505
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you . 1697.270981951081
Mr . Darcy ! 322.13483037989596
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church . 1552.0260878362167
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ' s performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste . 1371.8372049443744
I was given good <UNK> , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 1859.949835115672
You are not well enough ; you cannot go yourself . " Elizabeth hesitated , but her <UNK> <UNK> under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . 1882.4251959150654
. F . . Some states do not allow <UNK> of certain implied <UNK> or the exclusion or limitation of certain <UNK> of damages . 3136.5272705661637
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the <UNK> of a considerable <UNK> , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . 2788.356629141778
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . 1091.1491744806974
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . 3053.3487877314647
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them . 4790.772477938292
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . 2266.150191244045
The housekeeper came ; a respectable looking , <UNK> woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . 1763.184716444794
If I were not afraid of judging <UNK> , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . 3132.8687355013944
But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . 1748.9287226596969
" ' Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much . 1905.0000075945252
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 1983.3846657680685
But still he would be her husband . Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . 1261.2487092368685
" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living . 1411.5940106000373
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . 1886.039134671139
But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . 1617.5920202150098
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 2012.038122896213
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library . " Mrs . 1667.5710995260747
It was to be such a secret ! " " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject . 2372.0275333596937
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <UNK> , but Mrs . 2723.4772512455456
Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar . 1433.201456356793
On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and told her with great <UNK> that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . 1458.0958284841658
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the <UNK> ere long . " " Upon my word , Sir , " cried Elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . 1619.8015444561631
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> . 2792.5779889580085
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be . 1325.5023032017423
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . 1533.1248324256364
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would <UNK> his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . 1729.519974126475
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it <UNK> , has surprised me a good deal . 1742.7563769283256
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . 2001.1310985597393
Be so kind as to <UNK> for us to Miss Darcy . 1297.2051436643872
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very <UNK> to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . 1190.0275268352661
My mind was more agreeably engaged . 2026.3084264756096
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . " The wedding took place ; the bride and <UNK> set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . 1832.581030216706
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 2179.8570617793207
" I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she . 3067.975384607802
Hurst was observing their game . 1942.4405398707142
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ' s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . 2024.1643271169132
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . 1555.7180249560513
" What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? " " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . " " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . 1765.0358669574418
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . 1677.858289163801
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . 1639.928575752406
But Mrs . 1133.6359062803915
They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . 1587.074408496629
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . 2207.206937077534
It became her turn to listen . 2142.5060487376118
But vanity , not love , has been my folly . <UNK> with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . 2637.9062995869704
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . 1244.2300096026322
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 1926.475275390768
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 1760.178705254125
Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age . 2035.0248984793695
They are destined for each other by the voice of every <UNK> of their <UNK> houses ; and what is to divide them ? 4108.97057533974
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . 1842.3345507008305
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 2635.2008251661996
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as <UNK> <UNK> as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . 1640.1421423450267
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 1364.835961805122
This cannot be ! engaged to Mr . Darcy ! 886.0178234722576
What are men to <UNK> and mountains ? 4120.2576788333035
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . 2247.5486209917217
Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . 1390.726801160535
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh . 775.0424263146898
A regard for the <UNK> would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . 917.7000255870036
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy . 1258.6690401613744
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed ! 3217.240751481938
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . 1244.977861698165
there is not a bit of fish to be got to day . 3012.4196563927467
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 1641.340511002598
I want to talk very seriously . 1832.4968967818288
The officers will find women better worth their notice . 898.9150136321423
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in <UNK> it after this explanation . " Mr . Darcy , who was <UNK> against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . 1918.951604673514
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open <UNK> rejected . 925.4862195173304
Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for . 1549.6685389252505
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 463.50534437402507
Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . 801.3731016621782
Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . 1402.4947378044005
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 2456.0890431576454
Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 1939.1083505393904
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 1847.4987982535495
<UNK> as she was to admit an idea so <UNK> of Jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the <UNK> of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . 2771.1333408423293
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . " As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the <UNK> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . 1344.2153524588368
The hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . 1505.813932144996
If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go . 1263.2429537574696
" What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . 3210.2237044207877
So near a <UNK> to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart . 1596.3540322956426
" Yes if Darcy does not put it off again . 2125.6084661495806
" But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . " Elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . 2683.721441845831
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months . 1431.4181809389602
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you ! 2444.051325911907
It is almost past belief . 1597.2103120085437
I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to <UNK> such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room . 2263.4660660355617
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 1406.4995226867693
Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . 1656.2370087107174
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or <UNK> distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more <UNK> blind . 2971.539714583117
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . 1991.4711502106363
" Of music ! 4057.760009542434
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him . 1803.6694195083282
But your arts and <UNK> may , in a moment of <UNK> , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . 2919.264194185018
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " Oh ! " cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted . 2486.156632896913
The other is Miss De Bourgh . 1294.463570695753
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . 2059.5493070814796
He has the promise of an <UNK> in General ' s regiment , now quartered in the North . 4040.446470628474
How are they even to be discovered ? 3228.9847550561685
" But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with <UNK> , and rob it of a few <UNK> <UNK> without his perceiving me . " The period of expectation was now <UNK> . 3227.186334521742
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 2170.0449720233282
Not like the wild young men now a days , who think of nothing but themselves . 1279.3759333851183
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . " " Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . 1493.8136972729608
I always said it must be so , at last . 1047.0499649004898
Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 2185.6850761550536
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one <UNK> of perfect <UNK> in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his <UNK> that her manners were not those of the <UNK> world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . 2912.637979167467
" Yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally <UNK> , without raising all this <UNK> ! 1999.2086772965342
CHAPTER V . 1263.0515403986196
" I should never have said Mrs . 857.4156873912792
" Oh ! 1745.268895136781
Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley <UNK> with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . 2260.1880394717455
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Thus , we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper <UNK> . 2724.1484687781062
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much . 1504.4408037481205
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . 920.5131400338329
Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . 1670.6690619662422
As she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs . 1151.3950080626485
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from <UNK> my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . 2035.7494197982437
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . 2170.881264710381
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 2894.1961345585582
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 484.5109527661931
But gracious me ! 4448.479242903651
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 3109.727080364126
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 639.1581081278885
It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed <UNK> ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among <UNK> woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its <UNK> parts . 3078.5364363525473
But it must not , shall not be . 2197.306670909367
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . 1634.619412784808
" To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection . 2430.0761141510156
Why does she not come in ? " " Oh ! 3207.6760015193163
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
" Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared . 2023.2365199693581
My mother was in <UNK> , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! 1699.4940664435705
<UNK> people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . 2938.8597734976674
She often tried to provoke Darcy into <UNK> her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . 1965.3765273933725
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . 1360.954479142665
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . 733.9219759373128
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 2097.078881792508
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <UNK> of elegant nuptials , fine <UNK> , new carriages , and servants . 2030.5863471338143
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane . 907.999880526335
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . 1108.515707872364
Lord ! 2661.76988850611
<UNK> , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . 2505.1322742783473
Mr . and Mrs . 621.271393568558
I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . " " I desire you will do no such thing . 1589.4212828296384
It is really too distressing . 2559.91031728879
She then <UNK> again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . " " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . " " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something <UNK> <UNK> in the usual <UNK> of such a meeting . 1818.5163746003577
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to <UNK> such pleasures . 1959.5751944637652
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? 2320.134955253386
Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with <UNK> civility that they were perfectly needless . 1520.798221716897
His doing so drew her notice . 3071.010588963713
She blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . 1861.8211131724402
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 2645.175549231092
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . 1732.008515622702
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 3192.437162588076
They are my old friends . 2409.46944638262
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . 1793.7390984419976
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . 1625.266874942659
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . " The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they <UNK> satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had <UNK> Mrs . 2588.1345081852323
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . 1774.6273859128232
" My dear , dear aunt , " she <UNK> cried , " what delight ! 1800.1037584675657
Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 2404.1033325298054
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford . 1107.1403358909106
Bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone . 1061.4889127000154
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such <UNK> sisters , home could not be <UNK> , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake . 2498.5928466429455
Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time . 551.04155357539
<UNK> to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax <UNK> to the full extent permitted by U . S . federal laws and your state ' s laws . 2106.579849318289
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 1482.6238857776584
On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a <UNK> , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy . 1467.960418499562
When the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , <UNK> her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment <UNK> . 1464.905338755229
<UNK> of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where . 1395.9170289428669
They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins ' s admiration . 2119.110167625746
It was agreed to . 4465.4674320213
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 2209.4312415987906

He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . 2637.1987310650397
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 2210.2475056506446
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . " " This is not to be borne . 2323.0295793046475
She is well , and <UNK> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . Your ' s , c . 3409.3673390152026
<UNK> wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . 1897.8632393998616
With <UNK> tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of <UNK> that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . 2320.654561468145
The particulars , I reserve till we meet . 1707.345387850197
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . 1827.162376925745
And is it really true ? 2099.5188814783814
Her own thoughts were <UNK> her . 4632.711319735313
<UNK> or twice she could discern a <UNK> blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . 1852.4443861698583
<UNK> Lady Catherine as well as you can . 1392.2772012143473
What are you telling Miss Bennet ? 1077.9982281711095
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . 1585.3859049686453
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can <UNK> a woman . " " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? 1422.5538240683209
They all <UNK> tables , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> . 6102.528436684469
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid . 1524.5454252954296
Mr . Bennet ' s <UNK> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! 2149.5753320564895
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . 1195.7622941529028
Hurst were going out . 1660.0117086750397
She answered with equal indifference and <UNK> , and the other said no more . 2505.4146606411446
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two . 1311.2815298726368
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . 1758.970954687778
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . " " For heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr . Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . " Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . 1732.7876333383094
I came to try you . 2300.4279435413796
" A man who has once been refused ! 3384.008680088479
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 1840.4647563791755
Three daughters married ! 733.1321046249304
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <UNK> of Mrs . 2170.0238108938297
When is your turn to come ? 2443.7231317039127
<UNK> at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . 2050.5950410336973
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . 2375.4392040614284
This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham . 2384.7599320711092
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . 1144.0743619676543
In that case he would return no more . 1612.6267144651993
How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr . Bingley ? " " Not at all . " " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . 2432.0180479827445
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very <UNK> reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to <UNK> and <UNK> to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 1586.0492228248288
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . " " Good <UNK> ! " cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? How could his will be <UNK> ? Why did not you seek legal <UNK> ? " " There was just such an <UNK> in the terms of the <UNK> as to give me no hope from law . 2864.330481782584
A small sum could not do all this . " " No , " said her father , " Wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a <UNK> less than ten thousand pounds . 2148.5911353273805
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? " " I think she will . 1496.13142659583
" I am trying to make it out . " " And what is your success ? " She shook her head . 3554.8639169516705
Hurst began again . 1146.4751715634845
What will you think of my vanity ? 2631.047385004608
Collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . 916.8426641088225
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please . 2572.4251318488687
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . 1862.0962857701224
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . 3227.642820254341
Of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was <UNK> with admiration was evident enough . 1960.240938977363
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 1684.5239615083178
yes , " said Elizabeth drily " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a <UNK> deal of care of him . " " <UNK> of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care . 1295.647273994304
what is it about ? 7569.941675989626
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? " Nothing less than the complaisance of a <UNK> could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most <UNK> courtesy . 1784.998538850287
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 1324.2758819479495
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . 2307.4132103846964
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . 1377.7149623123166
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . 2489.5990763518544
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <UNK> . 1656.1126937964082
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . 2201.5663823934233
Brighton , and a whole <UNK> of <UNK> , to us , who have been <UNK> already by one poor regiment of militia , and the <UNK> balls of Meryton . " " Now I have got some news for you , " said Lydia , as they sat down to table . 2247.9629907913754
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 1711.7463484787895
" How could you begin ? " said she . 1649.7159660192133
But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 1956.8559029333985
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . 935.3193516271867
" With my mother up stairs . 2319.3391857802
She opened the door , and met Maria in the <UNK> place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza ! 1930.9896557635839
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 888.4721859629349
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley ' s heart were entertained . 1322.4974245486617
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 2545.9073660156705
I am not to be <UNK> into anything so wholly unreasonable . 4010.1021817175892
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . 1508.5634331924748
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . 1427.7344088415387
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " Lydia declared herself satisfied . 1509.2968138838369
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . " " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request . 1924.7437812043993
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? 1514.7382013333304

END OF THE <UNK> <UNK> . 5937.852791907465
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . 2042.1733643301413
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs . 1160.083242476569
I will only add , God bless you . 3954.6625232129345
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . 1691.1363915121947
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . 1889.86376666494

I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . 2426.8512710555356
They crossed it by a <UNK> bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a <UNK> , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the <UNK> <UNK> wood which bordered it . 2946.9456274264426
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . 2035.9042374773296
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 1651.2711919599788
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening . 2491.432217740941
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . " " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . " " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . " " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . " " But consider your daughters . 1827.3295947886952
It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . 1794.2236536358457
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . 2107.554835289465
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . 2693.1980335545536
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister . 1429.2543270093386
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . 2463.3096758549245
Good girl ! 948.8254922283663
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your ' s seems to have been . 4759.818593236004
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . " " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . 1267.163918064568
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . 2033.9954290417634
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . " " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister . 1565.7102118567416
You are so strange ! 4686.126374452654

A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 2700.3198577037037

Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . 1690.8442017287844

Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . 1576.2340269277881
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . 2178.9666509603026
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 1926.3303758653744
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely . 2443.3813921566366
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 1272.6001983824674
His plan did not vary on seeing them . Miss Bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his <UNK> notions of what was due to <UNK> ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice . 2205.892619521681
I am afraid you will be angry . " " My dearest sister , now be be serious . 2799.7062376647423
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 1190.5458440921143
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 1224.5075721513092
His brother in law , Mr . Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr . Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble <UNK> ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . 1159.8498641674157
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went <UNK> against the <UNK> ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <UNK> <UNK> , and give the praise where it was due . 2104.4868015304705
" And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . 2185.772396927418
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . " <UNK> ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 2249.280168059871

But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . " Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . 2377.389097578385

My youngest sister has left all her friends has <UNK> ; has thrown herself into the power of of Mr . Wickham . 1617.575847293962
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . 1558.1863581425791

Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 1632.6342640911273

When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr .

He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <UNK> of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James ' s , with very decent composure . 1850.9099400482203

Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <UNK> and <UNK> father ; and though he belonged to one of the <UNK> , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 1743.0180221818828

I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 1373.9705189073884
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . 1679.559501185427
Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an <UNK> sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she <UNK> him . 2306.7593230063844
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . 2345.189204563782

forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " There can be no doubt of that . 2963.9421454983485
She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece . 1798.6977594651366
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well . 1597.4480542706194
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . 2229.896911379429
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 2518.331722425386
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 1534.317990476166
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! 1626.7770671518279
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 1455.0591163807453
It will not do . 7569.941675989626
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . 3827.2400359162016
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . 1657.832131841997
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of inviting him . " " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . 3286.7375907870783
But here he was set right by Mrs . 1689.496478771865
It would have suited me in every respect . " " How should you have liked making sermons ? " " <UNK> well . 2067.0411835988284
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 2610.9146710980704
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time . 1871.4044607266394
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . 1456.6086415848608
. F . . Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph . F . , this work is provided to you ' <UNK> <UNK> ' , <UNK> NO <UNK> WARRANTIES OF ANY <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF <UNK> OR <UNK> FOR ANY <UNK> . 3931.8266971701087
But our visitor was very obstinate . 4267.155376537272
I had not believed it possible . " " I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth . 1615.202767732644
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees . 1730.5763688544625
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . 1453.4317283833136
What a fine thing for our girls ! " " How so ? 2792.8107908040597
Had his character been known , this could not have happened . 1662.133638258583
CHAPTER III . 1172.5131852383306
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . 1600.5415837246092
Pray read on . " " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she <UNK> so disgraceful a match . 1874.3515429523804
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . 2046.7735874710054
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Collins and myself sincerely <UNK> with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the <UNK> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 2238.9617032785736
Section . 2975.9492055808505
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . 1641.2777232461835
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to <UNK> the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 1745.17523978671
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not . 2056.40361955012
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 1989.3504003893086
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 2302.1998821906714
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 2592.0550243315392
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 2812.7222486781156
I did for you . 7569.941675989626
I will read it to you " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles <UNK> to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <UNK> <UNK> . 2173.5204596341255
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . 1077.1689053496902
The morrow produced no <UNK> of Mrs . 1762.5479628307692
She will make him a very proper wife . " Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the <UNK> , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly <UNK> whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way . 1662.6909103542253
Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . 2195.3471035272964
" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <UNK> , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss <UNK> ' s . " " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . " " Oh ! 1921.9233076669457
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his <UNK> to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm . 1258.9609590035975
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth . 2259.803660286184
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go . 2000.45483659614
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W . 2144.2057629291553
" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 2081.6833826262914
To no creature had it been revealed , where <UNK> was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 2146.0996015592746
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to <UNK> him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <UNK> of your understanding , but <UNK> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <UNK> , and those which <UNK> the <UNK> ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the <UNK> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 1807.2020843457115
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . 1424.7895454954564
CHAPTER <UNK> . 2004.9693439188225
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 1831.2741237317775
intending to trace their route . 3210.8456436201036
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . 1410.2958530418002
Her father <UNK> by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and <UNK> mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . 1404.9526467157414
You give me fresh life and <UNK> . 1817.7695649491418
Who would have thought it ! 1222.9126737341528
The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . 1410.506756129851
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him . 2014.3368031531804
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation . 3301.474540308267
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . 1001.3594192877559
I hate such false friends . 1729.4596887927844
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . 1711.5403767854696
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . 1485.8264797170584
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F . 1513.5101779885442
The pause was to Elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . 1421.4230401452144
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . " " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " And how impossible in others ! " " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? " " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . 2693.6400119866657
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 4645.899582219695
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such <UNK> as these . 3403.145610491462
<UNK> was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . 1482.0499753957058
Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . " Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . 1213.4059767556143
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child . 1722.5891539951538
Oh ! 868.1736111404341
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement <UNK> the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be <UNK> to make the <UNK> disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law . 2185.6131607998723
That he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . 2267.6671177455983
Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . 568.7084488530746
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . 1606.9665756822808
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty . 1348.23565707251
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ' s beauty . 1122.690350367415
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you . 2450.232780371525
If you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation . 1738.61872025848
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . 1544.8510506282541
Mr . Collins ' s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . 912.3970345861662
Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! Yes certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . " And <UNK> her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma ' am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr . Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . 1508.2727621332917
CHAPTER V . 1263.0515403986196
" Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our <UNK> way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . " Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and <UNK> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 1917.5789033858618
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . 1832.8089002256365
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them . 1718.3380333560256
My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . 1693.392279000056
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . 1911.8890470142887
This Mrs . 1133.6359062803915
His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . 3038.9230546673875
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <UNK> to that evening , " said Elizabeth . 1534.2913029741862
Your ' s , very sincerely , " <UNK> . 5804.077577879834
Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their <UNK> their income . 1909.3636430264069
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . 1758.5680560960234
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 4008.66447051961
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ' s way . " Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <UNK> . 1363.9311384544408
I am impatient to see him . " " In point of <UNK> , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective . 2259.9996696046605
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . 3818.4613541966646
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? 1563.9765793376198
She turned from sister to sister , <UNK> their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . 1976.8964637327501
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 2024.104398782529
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels . 1998.3312708224098
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 2609.165137973653
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what <UNK> his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 1622.4266512576025
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 1499.2791591846826
You shall hear what she says . " She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . Hurst had a house . 1637.7461279202903
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs . 1926.0707725974405
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
His sense of her inferiority of its being a <UNK> of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . 2725.9312630689005
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <UNK> society . " " But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . " " Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . 2005.9381152214912
Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . 1341.4441346861347
Their table was <UNK> stupid . 3252.8382830162714
They will take care not to <UNK> their income . 2583.4426158542315
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . 1807.4682832139013
I quite detest the man . " CHAPTER IV . 1405.909039755078
He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would <UNK> more birds on the first of <UNK> , than any body else in the country . 1638.2186023497338
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . " " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . " Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . 1363.0080577770407
In the hall they parted . 3106.707195189161
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 1662.8389077800787
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 2157.519294660275
Elizabeth did all she could , to <UNK> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 1670.5141162628952
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with <UNK> and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as <UNK> an air as possible . " Mr . Bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . 1734.623983702794
I will think no more about him . " Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth . 1961.1999341500614
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . 2544.277633334286
Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . 1090.1642690213264
I expected you to stay two months . 1076.9778184783138
Bennet , " to walk to <UNK> Mount this morning . 1829.0224011181822
" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr . Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing after all . I consider it as one of the first <UNK> of polished societies . " " Certainly , Sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in <UNK> amongst the less polished societies of the world . Every <UNK> can dance . " Sir William only smiled . 1759.7253307451674
" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said Mr . Gardiner . 822.3379065992874
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished <UNK> of integrity or benevolence , that might <UNK> him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the <UNK> of virtue , atone for those <UNK> errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . 2228.9442003348695
And what do you think she said besides ? 1609.1507965334793
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <UNK> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . 1643.0085952241554
do not repeat what I then said . 2783.819052040262
This cannot be ! 2342.7488338162257
and Mrs . 1133.6359062803915
" He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . 1459.935694430075
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in <UNK> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " said Jane as she finished it . 1814.4244041406355
Bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . 2749.28578117343
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 1472.0520357404114
But however he did not . 3328.187665711265
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day . " " Oh , yes . 1793.0962322791136
<UNK> as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . 1517.1624663787943
what news ? 2474.003557733726
" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs . 1057.3253887911017
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother How is she ? 2379.579019857257
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 2728.546032504223
The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 1922.071644616133
Whatever bears affinity to <UNK> is <UNK> . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 1958.1750650640968
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . 2058.1497513419417
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 2210.430925697644
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 2042.7158776029123
The possibility of Mr . Collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins ! 1371.587262824287
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little <UNK> by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . 2138.8902072876035
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 1835.7285876158378
What say you , Mary ? 1738.0538947112666
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , <UNK> every chance of <UNK> himself by marrying well ? 1494.1860294992262
Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . 2168.3992466088584
Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 1901.6103141037327
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may <UNK> to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund . 2130.881965269314
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . " " No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me . 2410.3392222602597
I shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will <UNK> and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " Elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 2046.11397833287
This letter is from Mr . Collins . " " From Mr . Collins ! 1082.7272582361195
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 2534.493638032561
I quite forgot ! 1572.774919312382
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . 1593.1004908588088
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . 909.8275356368717
" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . 1985.6860090730154
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . 1728.7045257004302
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly <UNK> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . 1387.2788265481186
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . 1655.8906094344734
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 1886.7652424959604
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 4309.428324584211
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . 1016.90983601225
Well , much good may it do them ! 799.1048518587905
<UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 3587.8072167694686
It was all pride and <UNK> . 4293.178475519444
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
but no one can throw any blame on them . 2521.4894745752563
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . 2356.336952369279
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 3345.0438153216032
You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs . 747.8230390670059
But of course she did not mention my name to you . " " Yes , she did . " " And what did she say ? " " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well . 3150.46680136255
Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . " Then addressing her daughter , " Oh ! 2341.7628090690687
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 1642.0407086776736
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . 2106.583538448862
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . " " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . " To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <UNK> of an elegant female . 2100.971182595312
At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s <UNK> him entirely , for she was a most determined <UNK> ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making <UNK> and exclaiming after <UNK> , to have attention for any one in particular . 2037.1744431817017
I appeal to Mr . Darcy but let me not interrupt you , Sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the <UNK> converse of that young lady , whose <UNK> eyes are also <UNK> me . " The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 1579.7848955610948
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 1713.4645565691117
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . 3039.1946549949766
Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . 1021.7277906819212
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> . 2433.175721026992
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . 1799.3044657444182
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . 2353.728156520133
" Can you come to morrow ? " Yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 2824.2055666499828
Gardiner was so little to be trusted . " " You must not blame my aunt . 1669.2147987349251
He was angry . 3740.710248688236
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . 1037.4550270459536
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . 1767.0213565784616
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and <UNK> , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <UNK> her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . 1874.713994855734
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very <UNK> manner , with all the <UNK> which he supposed a regular part of the business . 2162.339860112224
" It certainly is a most <UNK> affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . 1269.2943605199298
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 1480.5885935640533
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . 2397.8862539472816
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 2811.0687397666416
" Yours , c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a <UNK> fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . " " Oh ! 1970.127342555921
" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? " Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . 2396.1517108466483
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . 2338.062158664257
" If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs . 782.4615573863161
In the first place , she persisted in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might be broken off . 1795.1496403141825
Have not you always hated him ? " How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! 2844.2268453728434
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . " " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <UNK> which other people may observe . 2364.587515333526
On entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . 1438.3271123106401
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford <UNK> , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 1497.7173025643165
But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my <UNK> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . 2346.076764748786
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . 1063.6803377357783
As no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins ' s scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . 1299.017741231324
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . 1497.7234371835318
The <UNK> would be spoilt by <UNK> a fourth . 3171.6435488057027

He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . 684.4237027955671
In spite of her deeply <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger . 2266.876091379943
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest . 1103.185441444176
But , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . 2210.507508837353
Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time . 1666.171075374463
It was the last of the regiment ' s stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were <UNK> <UNK> . 2317.70794062669
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 2977.1989519847443
This room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . 2503.363362228786
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . 1327.455784620109
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . 1956.9706089002705
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish . 864.024731680598
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " " <UNK> do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 2038.9483373127437
Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c . 1202.2722428424402
Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 1743.8191164732516
" I do not get on at all . 4719.0392824973205
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley ' s <UNK> on fine eyes . 1408.394103622297
Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and <UNK> . 4194.224176716816
Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . 2179.4228569434226
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! 1655.6710546647337
Let me do it without farther loss of time . 966.4593372999261
But I must write no more . 1929.884170693104
I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . 1136.933333918915
" My dear , dear Lydia ! " she cried " This is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing . 1252.1515831927786
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ' s regiment . " His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative . 2264.088182864513
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . 1568.7511037348715
" But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy . 3473.051602326368
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . 1621.4740321193165
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a <UNK> as that , it might be of essential consequence . 2385.421267015696
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . " " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . " " In <UNK> your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were <UNK> . 1727.1645451823883
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his <UNK> , all honoured with the <UNK> of <UNK> , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . 3026.7644809771564
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over <UNK> evils , or <UNK> them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . 3557.788338760105
At present I will say nothing about it . " " You are quite right . 1747.1870005037754
I have by no means done . 2158.0266684969174
It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . 1719.1788573403676
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . 2042.3065642152635
That is all to be forgot . 5743.16524327372
Lord ! 2661.76988850611
If there were but such another man for you ! " " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . 2342.341776676559
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away . 960.9931342688635
Such a countenance , such manners ! 2628.6167607548373
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins . 1600.6711369650916
GARDINER . " " Is it possible ! " cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . 2368.073649555876
After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F . 700.5747200888424
<UNK> pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . 2722.9114035253983
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be <UNK> at , and it was rather too early to begin . 3027.098079613435
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . 2016.4361664762603
On finding Mrs . 925.585743874518
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such <UNK> , and her intreaty that she would not give into it . 1452.9323571953357
They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy . 2195.7306905765618
" Oh , yes ! if one could but go to Brighton ! 890.5550190422296
Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? " " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . 2169.5520969092845
He was <UNK> for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have <UNK> it . 2544.829682378083
This information , however , startled Mrs . 1094.091532471719
I ought not to have said a word about it . 2080.886748520379
Bennet , having <UNK> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . 1898.7947728506647
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . 1973.3952163892718
Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> . 1521.0572539517289
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty <UNK> , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . 1789.713904685781
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . 1963.1917459434535
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? 1180.389047197998
" How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! 2987.074902988746

that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! 2986.2351928203257
And then when we came away it was such fun ! 2563.3436200157084
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 2210.3767721032164
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . 1063.8628457970385
Elizabeth immediately began playing again . 468.7093757581016
You need not . 3599.2944117141496
They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! 2355.618915066501
Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " This walk is not wide enough for our party . 931.3978126849128
A clergyman like you must marry . <UNK> properly , chuse a <UNK> for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . 1564.8950688522068
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . 428.7415684135925
But now it comes out . " " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows . 4344.967104798932
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs . 1059.172405796786
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . 2485.9537604162447

sir , I do indeed . 2426.9353667138453
My feelings will not be repressed . 3339.4220501771592
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in <UNK> <UNK> to be her husband , might then have <UNK> in its proper place . 2046.5560153207339
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone . 1207.3656620262789
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . 2564.045561249428
" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . 1603.9498979924313
I shall be back by dinner . " " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . 1661.8013521949417
So high and so conceited that there was no <UNK> him ! 4832.653800034041
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . 3445.5747476284328
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! How much of good or evil must be done by him ! 1703.6743176961545
<UNK> , stay , I will go myself . 2925.9015500598607
CHAPTER XIII . 1263.0515403986196
My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . 1674.5863389651631
" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . 1500.5675077225185
They have at least that advantage . " " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . 2216.501084476867
Pemberley was now Georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . 1485.8728109863946
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <UNK> what <UNK> felicity really was . 1637.4456680357976
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . 2601.1268181548407
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 1948.717037195047
It originated in Mrs . 1890.6426838373948
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . 2288.95392410179
I cannot do justice to his kindness . 1878.8610029459378
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . 1626.229983598258
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . 1547.0995215465325
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 1512.218788437414
The loo table , however , did not appear . 1978.2926877111809
CHAPTER I . 2004.9693439188225
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of <UNK> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . 1886.8008102357915
Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? 2486.207081584673
It would be such a <UNK> scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . 1252.890328305773
Mrs . 454.4890746010465
Her affections had been continually <UNK> , but never without an object . 1816.7051494520128
" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . " Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . 1206.9208767928117
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 2059.30537994145
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a <UNK> of emotion they excited . 2824.6407491843524
There is a <UNK> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . 3290.7746593656216
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new <UNK> . 1077.3683950749885
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well . 1528.8373158519719
Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , <UNK> that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ? 1625.7047096262634
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented . 1105.5119980036352
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including <UNK> , online payments and credit card donations . 2347.5709062146693
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to <UNK> the fruits of her own <UNK> offence . 2261.454911559807
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . " " But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . " " Let me be rightly understood . 2707.1640776405393
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> . 1508.4966382014622
<UNK> me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . " Elizabeth could not refuse , though she <UNK> little pleasure in the visit . 1126.961475611157
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 1707.8532872774063
" Oh ! 1745.268895136781
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr . Darcy . She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! Yet it did , and even a third . 1833.6184765577882
I cannot quite agree with you there . 1651.9614122047456
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . 1751.8630127777233
He was full of joy and attention . 2063.603946960032
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . 1096.100091978419
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was Elizabeth ' s intimate friend . 1546.2958387271908
" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . 1240.400050753453
You have done all this ! 3514.7324176122384
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . 3238.0379731858056
Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . " " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK> accordingly . " " You did ! 2746.2960364581427
" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . " " It is no such thing . 1824.2150850020566
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 735.9566535832729
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy . 1568.0540731616804
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 1890.1481150541042
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 1974.3369732589176
I am very glad you liked her . 3094.945960510636
If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 839.5050658594718
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew . 1512.005237714052
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 2587.0292254574833
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . 1994.1119321672238
