4.734863082282909
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . " " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . 1.5199110829529336
You shall hear what she says . " She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . Hurst had a house . 1.4977474763452014
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . 10.000000000000002
But I dare not hope it . 8.11130830789687
They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . " " <UNK> a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . 1.3485595530525598
" Yet why did he come ? " She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . 1.93069772888325
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . 1.6496480740980204
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . 1.778279410038923
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 2.9935772947204895
dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . 3.8746751204561316
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification . 2.7213387683753076
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged . 1.93069772888325
Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . 4.216965034285822
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time . 2.610157215682537
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 1.5998587196060583
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 2.7213387683753076
Teaze him laugh at him . <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . " " But upon my honour I do not . 1.93069772888325
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! 3.593813663804627
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
She has two nieces of her own . 6.812920690579612
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the <UNK> , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 1.4677992676220695
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . 2.4244620170823286
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 1.425102670302998
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . 3.593813663804627
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 4.216965034285822
What is your own opinion ? " " That it ought not to be attempted . 3.1622776601683795
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 1.41011239906908
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might <UNK> to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . 1.4873521072935114
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . 2.0092330025650473
never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F . 2.610157215682537
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . 2.610157215682537
At length , she spoke again . 8.11130830789687
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 1.557068404753731
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . 1.365007806546014
What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a <UNK> of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . " " Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . " " And what arts did he use to separate them ? " " He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling . 1.181581732618101
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . " " You may depend upon it , Madam , " said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , " that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . " Mrs . 1.5199110829529336
She then took a large house in <UNK> street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . 2.7213387683753076
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . " " For heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr . Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . " Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . 1.338388753173757
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of <UNK> , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 1.5085907086001784
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had <UNK> time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 1.4412195967188537
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . " Elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! 1.7082763938087104
You need not . 17.78279410038923
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ? 1.4585940117250362
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 1.4773776525985112
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . <UNK> staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . 1.2096079377043663
Mary was obliged to <UNK> more with the world , but she could still <UNK> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <UNK> between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <UNK> to the change without much <UNK> . 1.4873521072935114
To his <UNK> engagement with Miss De Bourgh ? 5.878016072274914
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <UNK> of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave . 2.0535250264571463
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 2.51188643150958
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , <UNK> to invite him to sit by herself . 2.7213387683753076
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 2.346228848142263
I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew . 4.641588833612778
But so they always are . 10.000000000000002
<UNK> felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . 1.5199110829529336
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . 3.593813663804627
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 2.0092330025650473
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . 1.9684194472866121
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason . 1.5706464294715548
F . 46.415888336127786
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell <UNK> to mend a great <UNK> in my worked muslin gown , before they are <UNK> up . 1.778279410038923
You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " " You mistake me , my dear . 2.8480358684358014
Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . 2.610157215682537
I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 1.41011239906908
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 2.8480358684358014
Bennet . " My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received <UNK> at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right <UNK> Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose <UNK> and <UNK> has preferred me to the valuable <UNK> of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <UNK> myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those <UNK> and <UNK> which are <UNK> by the <UNK> of England . 1.2478254704700218
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 4.641588833612778
A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . 3.593813663804627
Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . 1.7082763938087104
She was going to the <UNK> ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of <UNK> , just fit to be killed . " Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour . 1.4773776525985112
" Can you come to morrow ? " Yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 2.0535250264571463
I shall never forget her appearance this morning . 5.878016072274914
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing . 1.9684194472866121
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 1.8632463119315603
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . 3.1622776601683795
They came . 26.82695795279726
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . 3.1622776601683795
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . 3.593813663804627
" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . 3.359818286283782
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . 4.216965034285822
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley . 5.179474679231212
Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 2.9935772947204895
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . 2.2122162910704493
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! 3.8746751204561316
Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 2.0092330025650473
Here , <UNK> , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . 2.7213387683753076
How is such a man to be worked on ? 5.179474679231212
Jenkinson ' s room . 12.915496650148839
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 3.8746751204561316
my sweetest Lizzy ! 17.78279410038923
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . 3.593813663804627
All field <UNK> were over . 10.000000000000002
what hours of <UNK> we shall spend ! 6.812920690579612
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 3.359818286283782
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home . 1.8047217668271702
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 1.8329807108324359
Catherine , weak <UNK> , irritable , and completely under Lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self <UNK> and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . 1.7301957388458942
. E . . You may convert to and distribute this work in any <UNK> , <UNK> , marked up , <UNK> or <UNK> form , including any word <UNK> or <UNK> form . 1.8329807108324359
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
Mr . Collins ! " " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . 2.2122162910704493
" You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . 4.641588833612778
If you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund . 1.8329807108324359
Her answer , therefore , was not <UNK> , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . 2.154434690031884
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . 2.8480358684358014
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . 3.593813663804627
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . 2.154434690031884
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . 1.6681005372000588
Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . 2.0535250264571463
Pray forgive me , if I have been very <UNK> , or at least do not punish me so far , as to <UNK> me from <UNK> . 2.0535250264571463
Yet he knew to the contrary himself . 6.812920690579612
" This will not do , " said Elizabeth . 5.179474679231212
He was received by Mrs . 10.000000000000002
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . 4.216965034285822
A clergyman like you must marry . <UNK> properly , chuse a <UNK> for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . 1.53174046370208
I do not deserve it . 10.000000000000002
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 12.915496650148839
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 1.1683354854432926
You are safe from me . " " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . " " And your defect is a <UNK> to hate every body . " " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . " " Do let us have a little music , " cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . " Louisa , you will not mind my <UNK> Mr . Hurst . " Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . 1.1747083882399671
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . " " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 1.4773776525985112
His temptation is not <UNK> to the risk . " " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment . 2.1017480113324885
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 1.1921636558879274
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 2.0535250264571463
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . 1.8632463119315603
" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! 1.4330125702369627
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to <UNK> her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever <UNK> . 1.4677992676220695
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <UNK> the excellent understanding , and <UNK> excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 1.2775649214671148
" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 1.93069772888325
<UNK> and <UNK> support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg tm ' s <UNK> and <UNK> that the Project Gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come . 1.7082763938087104
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . 1.8047217668271702
I hate such false friends . 10.000000000000002
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 2.154434690031884
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 5.179474679231212
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 2.51188643150958
Your <UNK> makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a <UNK> . " " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! 1.6681005372000588
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her <UNK> , by dwelling on them . 2.7213387683753076
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " " Are you , indeed ? 2.7213387683753076
The morrow produced no <UNK> of Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him . 2.8480358684358014
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her <UNK> of Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . " " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us . 1.3768571648527583
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 1.632172128563275
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 1.4585940117250362
Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . " Mr . Bennet made no answer . 2.4244620170823286
He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . 2.2122162910704493
" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . 2.2758459260747883
<UNK> that may be , you are <UNK> to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs . 2.346228848142263
We will go round the Park every day . 5.878016072274914
CHAPTER III . 26.82695795279726
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . 2.8480358684358014
CHAPTER XIX . 26.82695795279726
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . 1.353876180022544
" And pray may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a <UNK> tone , " Is it in address that he improves ? 2.0535250264571463
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <UNK> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . 1.557068404753731
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 1.319720393061375

" DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations . 3.593813663804627
What will Wickham say ? 12.915496650148839
Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very <UNK> too for it is provoking me to <UNK> , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly . 1.353876180022544
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . " Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . 1.5706464294715548
He could number the <UNK> in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <UNK> . 2.346228848142263
<UNK> it be so ? " " Oh , lord ! 4.641588833612778
She felt <UNK> the justice of Mr . Darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 1.8632463119315603
If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 1.8047217668271702
We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . 2.0535250264571463
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . 5.878016072274914
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . 1.8329807108324359
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 2.9935772947204895
We can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . 1.93069772888325
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement . 2.1017480113324885
She represented to him all the <UNK> of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be <UNK> to you to let them go alone . " " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " " Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . 1.3894954943731377
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . 2.8480358684358014
The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . 1.9684194472866121
" About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . " " Yes , " replied Wickham ; " his estate there is a noble one . 1.4977474763452014
I know you will contrive it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . 1.3111339374215643
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished . 2.9935772947204895
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 4.641588833612778
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Shall you like to have such a brother ? " " Very , very much . 3.1622776601683795
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 1.3830728955554412
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . 2.2122162910704493
. 100.00000000000004
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . " " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . 2.0092330025650473
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 1.8047217668271702
" His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . 4.216965034285822
<UNK> are too much like <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . 2.610157215682537
<UNK> would like to go too of all things ! 5.179474679231212
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and <UNK> way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to morrow evening . 1.5848931924611136
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 1.333521432163324
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . " " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . 1.3768571648527583
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 1.5199110829529336
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 2.0092330025650473
If you ' <UNK> believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 2.2122162910704493
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 3.359818286283782
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she <UNK> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . " Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication . 1.353876180022544
Elizabeth hoped she had <UNK> him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 2.2122162910704493
. E . . Do not <UNK> or <UNK> or remove the full Project Gutenberg tm License terms from this work , or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg tm . 1.6681005372000588
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . 6.812920690579612
They were within twenty <UNK> of each other , and so <UNK> was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . 2.2122162910704493
Your sweetness and <UNK> are really <UNK> ; I do not know what to say to you . 2.8480358684358014
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 1.333521432163324
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 2.8480358684358014
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her . 1.93069772888325
in every view it is unaccountable ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . 2.346228848142263
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? 1.4585940117250362
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . 1.93069772888325
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " " But I was embarrassed . " " And so was I . " " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " " A man who had felt less , might . " " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 1.2451970847350329
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that <UNK> is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . 1.53174046370208
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 1.8329807108324359
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please . 2.2122162910704493
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . 3.359818286283782
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . 1.4977474763452014
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . 1.6681005372000588
They will never be distressed for money . 6.812920690579612
Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active <UNK> , and when immediately before my father ' s death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . " " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth . 1.333521432163324
Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . " Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . 1.632172128563275
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband . 1.5199110829529336
" If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . 1.615598098439874
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 2.9935772947204895
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not <UNK> a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . 1.4585940117250362
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall <UNK> a list , according to his information . 1.9684194472866121
" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . 2.9935772947204895
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " " That you certainly shall . " " And I have another favour to ask . 1.6876124757881477
She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . 1.396135390856794
It was the last of the regiment ' s stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were <UNK> <UNK> . 2.2122162910704493
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent <UNK> of <UNK> on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . 1.5848931924611136
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 2.8480358684358014
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . 3.359818286283782
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . " " What should not you mind ? " " I should not mind any thing at all . " " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . " " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail . 1.3768571648527583
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 1.8047217668271702
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 1.6876124757881477
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . 4.216965034285822
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such <UNK> as these . 2.51188643150958
" He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . 2.51188643150958
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . 2.2122162910704493
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his <UNK> , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the <UNK> way for happiness . 1.3485595530525598
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . 2.8480358684358014
" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . 1.9684194472866121
What a contrast between him and his friend ! 5.878016072274914
She <UNK> the days that must <UNK> before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . 2.610157215682537
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies . 3.593813663804627
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! 3.359818286283782
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . 1.5706464294715548
CHAPTER XV . 26.82695795279726
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . 3.359818286283782
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . 1.8957356524063758
How was that possible ? 12.915496650148839
He was angry . 17.78279410038923
Bennet . 46.415888336127786
At that moment , she cared for no other . 5.179474679231212
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 2.7213387683753076
CHAPTER X . 26.82695795279726
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . 2.1017480113324885
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time . 1.778279410038923
At length Darcy spoke , and in a <UNK> manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . " " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with <UNK> , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . " Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . 1.2742749857031337
Thank Heaven ! 26.82695795279726
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 1.778279410038923
She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <UNK> him with fears and regrets in <UNK> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 1.2843862635897427
I am glad he is gone . 8.11130830789687
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference . 4.216965034285822
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of <UNK> to others . 2.2122162910704493
I know we dine with four and twenty families . " Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could <UNK> Bingley to keep his countenance . 2.2758459260747883
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . 3.359818286283782
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " Darcy mentioned his letter . 2.51188643150958
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane . 1.8632463119315603
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . " " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . " " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " I am not . " Lady Catherine seemed pleased . 1.2589254117941673
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can <UNK> so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most <UNK> to a <UNK> ' s mind . 1.6681005372000588
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more <UNK> , and less <UNK> than the other had ever seen him . 1.7082763938087104
<UNK> Lady Catherine as well as you can . 5.878016072274914
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 2.346228848142263
CHAPTER V . 26.82695795279726
It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
and Mrs . 26.82695795279726
She is unfortunately of a sickly <UNK> , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who <UNK> her education , and who still <UNK> with them . 1.5706464294715548
One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 1.425102670302998
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <UNK> on such a research ; in which <UNK> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally <UNK> , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . 1.3070104796093682
He now wished it more than ever . 6.812920690579612
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . 2.9935772947204895
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . 1.8632463119315603
<UNK> will be absolutely <UNK> , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . 3.1622776601683795
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . 2.7213387683753076
" He seems to be a most <UNK> and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so <UNK> as to let him come to us again . " " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . " " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . " Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of <UNK> , marrying , and <UNK> his <UNK> whenever it were required . 1.1624103738131295
where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without <UNK> a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . 1.4585940117250362
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . " " And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? " " The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . 1.333521432163324
Mr . Darcy ! 17.78279410038923
Lydia laughed , and said , " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . 2.8480358684358014
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth ! 2.1017480113324885
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . 2.2122162910704493
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as <UNK> <UNK> as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . 1.5706464294715548
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s foot <UNK> , that she said , ' Mr . Collins , you must marry . 2.2758459260747883
" I admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he . 3.359818286283782
Every thing that is charming ! 10.000000000000002
I am sure I <UNK> ' <UNK> get a wink of sleep all night . 3.359818286283782
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? 2.4244620170823286
His letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in <UNK> business , he was quick in its execution . 2.610157215682537
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . " " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . 1.5085907086001784
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> . 3.1622776601683795
There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . 2.51188643150958
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . " " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . " Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . 1.396135390856794
As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room . 1.4174741629268053
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . 4.216965034285822
" It certainly is a most <UNK> affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . 1.9684194472866121
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh . 8.11130830789687
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long <UNK> . " Mrs . 1.8632463119315603
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . 3.593813663804627
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! 4.641588833612778
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 2.7213387683753076
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . 2.9935772947204895
<UNK> Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . " " If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . " " She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . 1.3153690504363762
Bennet and the children . 12.915496650148839
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 1.3287913432286882
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 4.641588833612778
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first <UNK> his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . 1.7534865500829584
Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority . 1.93069772888325
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 5.878016072274914
No , never . 17.78279410038923
Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 1.6876124757881477
Her <UNK> wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . 3.8746751204561316
They had long wished to see him . 6.812920690579612
Yes , I call it a very easy distance . " " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth . 1.8957356524063758
Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . 2.346228848142263
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 2.8480358684358014
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . 2.1017480113324885
He still loves me , and we are engaged . " Jane looked at her <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend . 2.346228848142263
CHAPTER II . 26.82695795279726
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 3.1622776601683795
I knew how it would be . 8.11130830789687
I thought I should have died . 8.11130830789687
<UNK> my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . 4.641588833612778
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . 1.164729742018898
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due . " " My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . 1.28792362543363
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <UNK> recommendation , and to assert that I had <UNK> all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . 1.5085907086001784
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will <UNK> you ; and so generous , that you will always <UNK> your income . " " I hope not so . 1.5998587196060583
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 2.610157215682537
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 2.154434690031884
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . " " Not as you represent it . 2.610157215682537
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 1.5441135899948315
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . 1.6876124757881477
Not all that Mrs . 12.915496650148839
He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . 2.8480358684358014
In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 1.8329807108324359
She is gone down to her uncle at <UNK> ; gone to stay . 3.593813663804627
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . 2.9935772947204895
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . 5.878016072274914
Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . 2.9935772947204895
Pemberley was now Georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . 2.346228848142263
CHAPTER XV . 26.82695795279726
" I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . " " Perhaps I do . 1.93069772888325
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? 5.878016072274914
" This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! 2.2758459260747883

" And that , " said Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Who would have thought it ! 10.000000000000002
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . 2.7213387683753076
<UNK> , stay , I will go myself . 5.878016072274914
Hurst were going out . 12.915496650148839
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 1.93069772888325
CHAPTER XVII . 26.82695795279726
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness . 2.346228848142263
I will read it to you " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles <UNK> to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <UNK> <UNK> . 1.2710617996147449
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body . 2.154434690031884
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 1.6876124757881477
Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . 1.8329807108324359
<UNK> in law of Wickham ! 10.000000000000002
I am going away myself . " " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . " And upon Elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr . Collins . " Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . 1.2077226551344626
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 1.4330125702369627
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 3.359818286283782
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 2.346228848142263
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . " " Oh ! 1.615598098439874
Her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 1.632172128563275
<UNK> , selfish girl ! 12.915496650148839
" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any <UNK> , rather adds to your other perfections . 2.0535250264571463
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 2.0092330025650473
I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 1.778279410038923
Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time . 2.2758459260747883
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him . 1.557068404753731
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . 4.641588833612778
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not <UNK> , but haughty . 2.4244620170823286
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of <UNK> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . 1.615598098439874
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 2.346228848142263
and what can he have to say ? " " Something very much to the purpose of course . 2.7213387683753076
Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey . 2.9935772947204895
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . 1.9684194472866121
She declared her resolution . 12.915496650148839
He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . 3.359818286283782
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . 2.0092330025650473
In that case he would return no more . 5.878016072274914
" And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . 2.51188643150958
Bennet , having <UNK> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . 1.4412195967188537
Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . 2.1017480113324885
<UNK> Michael S . 17.78279410038923
nonsense , how can you talk so ! 6.812920690579612
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to <UNK> the fruits of her own <UNK> offence . 1.632172128563275
With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were <UNK> understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged . 1.3830728955554412
She directly replied , " You need not be frightened . 4.641588833612778
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 2.2758459260747883
I was given good <UNK> , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 3.1622776601683795
yes ; there is nothing in that . 6.812920690579612
" You look pale . 12.915496650148839
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them . " This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret . 1.338388753173757
But our visitor was very obstinate . 8.11130830789687
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 1.5998587196060583
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <UNK> to that evening , " said Elizabeth . 2.0092330025650473
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 4.641588833612778
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . 3.593813663804627
At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s <UNK> him entirely , for she was a most determined <UNK> ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making <UNK> and exclaiming after <UNK> , to have attention for any one in particular . 1.4412195967188537
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were <UNK> to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . 1.4030037231905736
That he has neither integrity nor honour . 6.812920690579612
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 2.7213387683753076
Lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . 1.8957356524063758
When Mrs . 26.82695795279726
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever . " Darcy was fixed in astonishment . 2.1017480113324885
His disposition must be dreadful . " " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . " Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from <UNK> , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! " " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; <UNK> of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same <UNK> care . 1.143245590242695
From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 1.3593563908785256
My father , however , is partial to Mr . Wickham . 4.216965034285822
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <UNK> them . 3.593813663804627
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . 2.610157215682537
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be <UNK> at , and it was rather too early to begin . 2.4244620170823286
At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . " With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 1.5085907086001784
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . 3.1622776601683795
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . 2.154434690031884
" But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " A thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy . 1.5199110829529336
" The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . 2.1017480113324885
They all <UNK> tables , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
<UNK> ' s note <UNK> and <UNK> changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book . 2.610157215682537
She studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . 3.1622776601683795
The time fixed for the beginning of their <UNK> tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . 1.93069772888325
You will be a very happy woman . " Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 2.2122162910704493
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal . " " True . 2.346228848142263
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <UNK> circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her <UNK> and steady candour always <UNK> for <UNK> , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 1.4585940117250362
Gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , <UNK> of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 1.2775649214671148
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such <UNK> sisters , home could not be <UNK> , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake . 1.778279410038923
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <UNK> of a bad day . 2.154434690031884
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 1.8957356524063758
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
Mr . Collins received and returned these <UNK> with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <UNK> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 1.41011239906908
I have not that pain . 10.000000000000002
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . 2.2758459260747883
" You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age . " " I am not one and twenty . " When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . 1.557068404753731
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 2.610157215682537
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled . " A gentleman and a stranger ! 3.8746751204561316
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a <UNK> fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered <UNK> to the repeated <UNK> of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 1.2742749857031337
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most <UNK> in inviting Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 1.2532543355087804
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 1.5706464294715548
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 1.632172128563275
Jane was by no means better . 8.11130830789687
If I were not afraid of judging <UNK> , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . 2.0092330025650473
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . 1.615598098439874
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . 3.8746751204561316
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . " Kitty , who took all these <UNK> in a serious light , began to <UNK> . 1.5848931924611136
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . 4.216965034285822
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 1.8047217668271702
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 1.9684194472866121
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 1.6496480740980204
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 2.2122162910704493
Lydia , my love , ring the bell . 5.878016072274914
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
That tall , proud man . " " Good gracious ! 4.641588833612778
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . " " Ah ! 2.8480358684358014
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 1.2809343786525484
" Oh , Jane , take care . " " My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . " " I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . " They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs . 1.4030037231905736
F . 46.415888336127786
" My dear <UNK> , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of <UNK> each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s t te t te between two women can never end without a quarrel . 1.4497406703726319
" If they had uncles enough to <UNK> all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one <UNK> less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . 1.53174046370208
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . 3.359818286283782
They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . " CHAPTER IV . 1.7082763938087104
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . 3.593813663804627
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . " " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " " Has your governess left you ? " " We never had any governess . " " No governess ! 1.4977474763452014
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole <UNK> of <UNK> , as was here collected in one individual . 1.9684194472866121
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . 1.53174046370208
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 1.6496480740980204
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . 2.346228848142263
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 1.2679227183627855
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so <UNK> . 2.154434690031884
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <UNK> from the marriage of her sisters . 2.8480358684358014
<UNK> there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or <UNK> . 2.4244620170823286
But are you pleased , Jane ? 8.11130830789687
She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 1.632172128563275
Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently . 6.812920690579612
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day <UNK> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . 1.557068404753731
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 2.1017480113324885
<UNK> was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . 1.7301957388458942
Well , well , I only hope it will last . 4.641588833612778
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . 3.8746751204561316
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . " <UNK> as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat <UNK> , she had all the success she expected . 1.3111339374215643
Bennet was <UNK> the fire . 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
We had better not mention it . 8.11130830789687

" My dear , dear Lydia ! " she cried " This is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing . 1.4873521072935114
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . 1.4977474763452014
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up . 2.7213387683753076
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 1.7301957388458942
In the former were many good <UNK> ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some <UNK> of Miss Darcy ' s , in <UNK> , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . 1.4677992676220695
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 4.641588833612778
If this be the case , he deserves you . 5.179474679231212
Gardiner , though unknown . 12.915496650148839
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . " " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were <UNK> and insolent . 1.2376350284724815
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . 1.7534865500829584
You see how continually we are engaged there . 5.878016072274914
why did she come ? 12.915496650148839
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been <UNK> , and it had actually been <UNK> that Colonel Forster was going to be married . 1.53174046370208
Lady Catherine was <UNK> proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her . 2.346228848142263
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 1.632172128563275
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 6.812920690579612
Have you had any flirting ? 10.000000000000002
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> . 1.5848931924611136
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 1.7534865500829584
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . 3.359818286283782
I hope you have destroyed the letter . 6.812920690579612
" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . " While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . 1.6876124757881477
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the <UNK> of red <UNK> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 1.7534865500829584
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by turns . 3.359818286283782
Bennet <UNK> the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . 3.593813663804627
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . 5.179474679231212
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . " " Are you quite sure , Ma ' am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said Jane . " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . " " Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . " " Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . 1.221677348996792
" But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with <UNK> , and rob it of a few <UNK> <UNK> without his perceiving me . " The period of expectation was now <UNK> . 1.7082763938087104
Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 3.359818286283782
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . 5.179474679231212
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . 3.359818286283782
The t te t te surprised them . 6.812920690579612
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 3.359818286283782
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 1.5199110829529336

In spite of her deeply <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger . 1.396135390856794
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily <UNK> seeing him , till after the departure of the former . 1.8047217668271702
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 2.2758459260747883
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . " Elizabeth was distressed . 3.359818286283782
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . 1.4412195967188537
<UNK> me in silence . 12.915496650148839
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . 2.610157215682537
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a <UNK> library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read <UNK> . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose <UNK> ' s <UNK> . 1.3708385261355818
That he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . 3.359818286283782
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 3.1622776601683795
" And may I ask ? " said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . " " <UNK> with ! 2.0535250264571463
Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . " " No , no . 2.9935772947204895
How he lived I know not . 8.11130830789687
We were always good friends ; and now we are better . " " True . 3.1622776601683795
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , <UNK> from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and <UNK> by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 1.3485595530525598
Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him . 2.154434690031884
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? 4.216965034285822
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . 1.4677992676220695
Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . 2.9935772947204895
The old lady is Mrs . 10.000000000000002
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . 5.878016072274914
Lord ! 46.415888336127786
" I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . 1.7301957388458942
" You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Elizabeth immediately began playing again . 10.000000000000002
A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it <UNK> from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . 2.2758459260747883
She would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house . " Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer . 1.6876124757881477
No thanks to his gallantry for that . 6.812920690579612
She had even learnt to <UNK> , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a <UNK> to disgust and weary . 2.1017480113324885
He was <UNK> his memory with <UNK> and noble names . 4.641588833612778
Bingley was the principal <UNK> , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 3.8746751204561316
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 1.3830728955554412
" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . " Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . 1.4773776525985112
The <UNK> and yet the noise ; the <UNK> and yet the self importance of all these people ! What would I give to hear your <UNK> on them ! " " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . 1.6496480740980204
Are you going much farther ? " " No , I should have turned in a moment . " And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together . 1.8632463119315603
Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . 3.1622776601683795
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . 2.4244620170823286
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country . 1.5848931924611136
We were married , you know , at St . <UNK> ' s , because Wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish . 2.2758459260747883
Miss Lucas is married and settled . 8.11130830789687
I wish you had been there . 8.11130830789687
" Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . 3.1622776601683795
Bennet ' s civilities . 12.915496650148839
have you heard from my uncle ? " " Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . " " Well , and what news does it bring ? 1.8957356524063758
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 2.7213387683753076
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . " While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much <UNK> to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s . 1.2401035305418566
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it <UNK> , has surprised me a good deal . 1.8329807108324359
" <UNK> Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at <UNK> , if the drawing room were larger ; but <UNK> is too far off ! 1.7082763938087104
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 4.216965034285822
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . 3.593813663804627
Elizabeth <UNK> the next morning to the same thoughts and <UNK> which had at length closed her eyes . 2.7213387683753076
" It must not be thought of . 6.812920690579612
Her mind was less difficult to <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 2.346228848142263
A <UNK> life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . 2.7213387683753076
Mr . and Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . 6.812920690579612
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 6.812920690579612
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure . " The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs . 1.3894954943731377
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 1.6681005372000588
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! 5.179474679231212
But I have other <UNK> . 10.000000000000002
<UNK> since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 2.4244620170823286
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more <UNK> purpose . 2.8480358684358014
It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . 1.93069772888325
In <UNK> lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <UNK> in this interference . 2.0092330025650473
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . 1.7534865500829584
His character was decided . 12.915496650148839
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . 1.8957356524063758
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature . 2.7213387683753076
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted <UNK> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <UNK> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . 1.8047217668271702
and his sisters are charming women . 8.11130830789687
To Mr . Bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 1.6681005372000588
what has she to do with it ? 6.812920690579612
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . 1.4773776525985112
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas ' s last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the <UNK> were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three <UNK> <UNK> at least . 1.5848931924611136
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 3.8746751204561316
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . 2.8480358684358014
Her answer was warmly in his favour . 6.812920690579612
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 1.4677992676220695
Hill began instantly to express her joy . 6.812920690579612
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the <UNK> Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . 1.4677992676220695
<UNK> has she condescended to give me her opinion <UNK> too ! on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our <UNK> at quadrille , while Mrs . 1.7534865500829584
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and <UNK> the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 1.2710617996147449
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . 2.2122162910704493
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . 2.154434690031884
But however he did not . 10.000000000000002
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . 3.593813663804627
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <UNK> , readily obeyed . 2.51188643150958
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ? 2.51188643150958
I came to you without a doubt of my reception . 4.641588833612778
It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
Lydia was Lydia still ; <UNK> , <UNK> , wild , noisy , and <UNK> . 3.1622776601683795
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . 2.4244620170823286
Lakes , mountains , and <UNK> , shall not be <UNK> together in our <UNK> ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . 1.778279410038923
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 1.302994338575022
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction . 3.593813663804627
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did . 1.5706464294715548
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 1.2195704601594413
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of <UNK> , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her <UNK> <UNK> . 1.3485595530525598
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room . 1.4412195967188537
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 1.9684194472866121
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 1.778279410038923
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in <UNK> to the proposal before him . 1.8047217668271702
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . " " And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the <UNK> of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! 1.2843862635897427
Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach . 2.2758459260747883
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . " " To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . " " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . " " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . 1.2175031274276027

Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of <UNK> them . 1.6876124757881477
He takes them now for people of fashion . " The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she <UNK> a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his <UNK> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . 1.4174741629268053
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <UNK> , but Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . 5.179474679231212
how he must have felt it ! " " I never saw any one so shocked . 2.9935772947204895
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . 2.9935772947204895

When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . 2.154434690031884
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance . 1.4677992676220695
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . 1.4330125702369627
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels . 2.8480358684358014

He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her . 2.0092330025650473
Mr . Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . 2.2122162910704493
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 2.1017480113324885
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my <UNK> from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . 2.346228848142263
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that <UNK> is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . 1.333521432163324
Hart was the <UNK> of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone . 2.2758459260747883
" You may well warn me against such an evil . 4.641588833612778

The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 3.1622776601683795

Hill and the two <UNK> . 10.000000000000002
It was gratitude . <UNK> , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <UNK> and <UNK> of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 1.5998587196060583
He does not want abilities . 10.000000000000002
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an <UNK> of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . 1.93069772888325
I have not been accustomed to such language as this . 4.641588833612778
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 2.154434690031884
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 1.2401035305418566
It would <UNK> me , indeed , to see you again the <UNK> of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 1.2305240043592616
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 6.812920690579612
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! 3.1622776601683795
We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 2.51188643150958
It is of all subjects my delight . 6.812920690579612
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 2.7213387683753076
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 1.5706464294715548
He was on one side of her mother . 5.878016072274914
Bennet ' s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . 3.1622776601683795
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 1.3485595530525598

He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . 3.593813663804627
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 1.5848931924611136
Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? " " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . 1.7534865500829584
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 1.396135390856794
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . <UNK> immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . " " What is his name ? " " Bingley . " " Is he married or single ? " " Oh ! 1.2451970847350329
Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their <UNK> in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . 1.3485595530525598
. F . . Some states do not allow <UNK> of certain implied <UNK> or the exclusion or limitation of certain <UNK> of damages . 2.2122162910704493
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better <UNK> room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . 1.319720393061375
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . 2.346228848142263
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry . 1.93069772888325
" Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say . 2.346228848142263
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 1.6681005372000588
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . 1.93069772888325
" How could you begin ? " said she . 5.179474679231212
" But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing . 2.51188643150958
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion . 2.8480358684358014
If gratitude and esteem are good <UNK> of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 2.346228848142263
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> . 1.8632463119315603
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . " " Lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . " " I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a <UNK> of character . 1.324192791886045
" Of music ! 17.78279410038923
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . " " I am , " said he , with a firm voice . 2.0535250264571463
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity . 1.8957356524063758
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . 1.93069772888325
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . 3.8746751204561316
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ' s two sisters . 1.6496480740980204
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 1.7534865500829584
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 2.0092330025650473
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . 1.6876124757881477
<UNK> <UNK> the face of Mrs . 8.11130830789687
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very <UNK> to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . 2.2122162910704493
how can it affect them ? " " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! 2.1017480113324885
He has heartily <UNK> me now . " Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . 1.7534865500829584
He studies too much for words of four <UNK> . Do not you , Darcy ? " " My style of writing is very different from yours . " " Oh ! " cried Miss Bingley , " Charles <UNK> in the most careless way imaginable . 1.5706464294715548
The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . 2.346228848142263
" I cannot make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by <UNK> for being next in the entail ? We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " No , my dear ; I think not . 1.4174741629268053
But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . 1.7534865500829584
We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation . 2.51188643150958
She practises very constantly . " " So much the better . 4.216965034285822
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 1.8329807108324359
Her ease and good spirits increased . 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , <UNK> on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 1.5998587196060583

" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . 1.8957356524063758
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it . 1.4677992676220695

The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion . 4.216965034285822
Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy . 1.632172128563275
" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . " " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . " Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . 1.324192791886045
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a <UNK> , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , <UNK> to Kitty and Lydia . 1.4873521072935114
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . 1.3433993325989002
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . " " You observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . " " Certainly not . " " To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! 1.295267744355328
Long has promised to introduce him . " " I do not believe Mrs . 3.359818286283782
Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . 3.593813663804627
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 3.359818286283782
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 1.8957356524063758
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . " " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be <UNK> beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen . 1.4585940117250362
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 1.2589254117941673
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . 3.1622776601683795
CHAPTER <UNK> . 26.82695795279726
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 2.9935772947204895
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few <UNK> , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <UNK> . " Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 1.3287913432286882
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam . 3.359818286283782
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield . 1.5848931924611136
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . 2.51188643150958
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 1.6876124757881477
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . 3.593813663804627
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 4.641588833612778
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance <UNK> , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . 2.346228848142263
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . 1.6681005372000588
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . 2.9935772947204895
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . 1.4412195967188537
Are not you curious to hear how it was <UNK> ? " " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . " " La ! 1.7534865500829584
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . " " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <UNK> which other people may observe . 1.3070104796093682
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more . 4.216965034285822
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other . 2.8480358684358014

This son was to join in <UNK> off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . 1.8329807108324359
Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to <UNK> it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . 1.8329807108324359

You supposed more than really existed . 8.11130830789687
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it . 3.359818286283782
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . 1.8632463119315603
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done . 1.9684194472866121
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <UNK> , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room . 1.7534865500829584
She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 1.5998587196060583
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh ! 5.179474679231212
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . " <UNK> by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did . 1.4174741629268053
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! 5.179474679231212

I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . " " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 1.7301957388458942
Mr . Darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . 2.7213387683753076
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone . 1.6876124757881477
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word . 3.359818286283782
They crossed it by a <UNK> bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a <UNK> , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the <UNK> <UNK> wood which bordered it . 1.425102670302998
He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . 2.8480358684358014
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 2.4244620170823286
At present I will say nothing about it . " " You are quite right . 3.1622776601683795
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . 2.4244620170823286
She had been <UNK> pleased to approve of both the <UNK> , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . 2.2758459260747883

Every thing , however , went on <UNK> , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ' s first sketch . 2.51188643150958
But it was a hope shortly checked by other <UNK> , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . 1.4677992676220695
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . 2.346228848142263
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <UNK> attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 1.425102670302998

To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . 5.878016072274914

And do you really love him quite well enough ? 5.179474679231212

By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw <UNK> in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . 1.4030037231905736
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?

My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 3.359818286283782

As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . 1.8047217668271702
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her <UNK> spirits , and of teaching her that her present <UNK> are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 1.5848931924611136
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . 1.2058708946926584
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 1.557068404753731
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . 4.216965034285822
You cannot have been always at Longbourn . " Elizabeth looked surprised . 3.8746751204561316
Every body declared that he was the <UNK> young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always <UNK> the appearance of his goodness . 1.8632463119315603
" I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr . Darcy ! " " It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . " " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . " " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . " " <UNK> ! 1.2505106035854068
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 2.8480358684358014
Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better . 5.878016072274914
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 1.9684194472866121
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and <UNK> . 1.778279410038923
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 2.154434690031884
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . 4.216965034285822
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so . 3.1622776601683795
Never mind Miss Lizzy ' s hair . " " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . " " Oh ! 1.5199110829529336
Elizabeth , <UNK> all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . 1.4030037231905736
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . 2.610157215682537
Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . 3.359818286283782
" There is nothing the matter with me . 5.878016072274914
What will become of me . 10.000000000000002
They had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister . 3.593813663804627
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . 3.359818286283782
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . 2.4244620170823286
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 3.8746751204561316
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard . 3.1622776601683795
END OF THE <UNK> <UNK> . 10.000000000000002
<UNK> as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . 2.610157215682537
He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 1.5441135899948315
" You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice . 1.6681005372000588
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> ! 3.593813663804627
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild <UNK> , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character . 1.93069772888325
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 2.346228848142263
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . 4.641588833612778
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . 2.0092330025650473
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 4.641588833612778
Is nothing due to me on that score ? 5.878016072274914
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <UNK> , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 1.396135390856794
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . 3.593813663804627
Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <UNK> . 1.4585940117250362
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr . Wickham . 2.8480358684358014
Did you see it ? " Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . 2.9935772947204895
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! 1.9684194472866121
Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . 1.8329807108324359
" You are <UNK> , Lizzy . 8.11130830789687
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost . 2.154434690031884
They are my old friends . 10.000000000000002
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and <UNK> heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 1.5998587196060583
Collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much . 3.8746751204561316
Her father <UNK> by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and <UNK> mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . 1.5441135899948315
<UNK> as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . 2.1017480113324885
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . " It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . 1.6681005372000588
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 1.557068404753731
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! 1.5199110829529336
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . 3.1622776601683795
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . 3.359818286283782
It is impossible that he should still love me . " After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on <UNK> their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water <UNK> , there <UNK> to be a little alteration . 1.425102670302998
" Good gracious ! " cried Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Two <UNK> , however , were plainly <UNK> from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been <UNK> used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 1.4773776525985112
I never saw such a long <UNK> in my life . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth longed to <UNK> its <UNK> ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy ! 3.8746751204561316
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
It seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary <UNK> , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . 1.5848931924611136
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 2.51188643150958
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 2.154434690031884
Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley . 1.8957356524063758
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia ' s marriage . 2.8480358684358014
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is <UNK> . " " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical . 5.878016072274914
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you . 3.359818286283782
I told Mrs . 17.78279410038923
Well ! 46.415888336127786
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 3.8746751204561316
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room . 2.7213387683753076
Their visits to Mrs . 12.915496650148839
<UNK> these efforts , Project Gutenberg tm electronic works , and the medium on which they may be <UNK> , may contain " <UNK> , " such as , but not limited to , <UNK> , <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> errors , a copyright or other intellectual property <UNK> , a defective or <UNK> <UNK> or other medium , a computer <UNK> , or computer <UNK> that <UNK> or cannot be read by your equipment . 1.324192791886045
Not a soul knew of it , but <UNK> . 5.179474679231212
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . 1.5998587196060583
Have you seen any pleasant men ? 8.11130830789687
" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . 1.8329807108324359
Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 5.179474679231212
I had no notion but he would go a <UNK> , or something or other , and not <UNK> us with his company . 2.2758459260747883
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned . 1.2154742500762865
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . 2.4244620170823286
Dear , dear Lizzy . 12.915496650148839
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook , complying with the rules is very easy . 2.610157215682537
You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg tm works . 2.8480358684358014
They must have seen them together for ever . " " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . 1.7301957388458942
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . 1.8047217668271702
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 2.4244620170823286
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company . 1.8632463119315603
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <UNK> by the possessor , and often without any attention to the <UNK> of the performance . 2.0535250264571463
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 2.7213387683753076
Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! 1.93069772888325
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat <UNK> attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must <UNK> every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <UNK> . 1.3768571648527583
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 2.7213387683753076
She dared not even mention that gentleman . 6.812920690579612
Lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 1.7301957388458942
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . 2.610157215682537
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away . 1.8329807108324359
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished <UNK> of integrity or benevolence , that might <UNK> him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the <UNK> of virtue , atone for those <UNK> errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . 1.3708385261355818
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances and to have Mr . Collins instead ! 2.610157215682537
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 3.593813663804627
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of <UNK> the mind of his wife . 1.3708385261355818
I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . " " I desire you will do no such thing . 1.396135390856794
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time . 2.154434690031884
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 2.2122162910704493
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what <UNK> his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 1.365007806546014
I am perfectly satisfied . 12.915496650148839
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 1.4330125702369627
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 3.8746751204561316
How strange must it appear to him ! 6.812920690579612
Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her . 2.2758459260747883
Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . 1.93069772888325
" <UNK> . 26.82695795279726
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . 1.4773776525985112
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 1.6681005372000588
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 1.8329807108324359
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . 2.610157215682537
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . " " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . " " In <UNK> your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were <UNK> . 1.2560585988318853
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 1.9684194472866121
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing <UNK> , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . 1.2532543355087804
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a <UNK> situation , and always spending more than they ought . 2.346228848142263
Elizabeth took up some <UNK> , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . 2.51188643150958
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 1.3287913432286882
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 1.9684194472866121
One must speak a little , you know . 5.878016072274914
So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 2.2122162910704493
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of <UNK> on Mr . Collins ' s side , and as many bows on Sir William ' s , they departed . 1.6876124757881477
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . 2.1017480113324885
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . 3.593813663804627
I am not qualified to form one . 6.812920690579612
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! 1.7301957388458942
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . 3.359818286283782
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 1.7301957388458942
No sentiment of shame gave a <UNK> to her triumph . 4.641588833612778
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 1.8957356524063758
Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . 1.778279410038923
<UNK> had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and <UNK> her disgust of Mr . Collins . 2.7213387683753076
You know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . 2.8480358684358014
" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? 4.216965034285822
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it . 1.778279410038923
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be <UNK> into it ? " " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to <UNK> with rather more <UNK> the degree of importance which is to <UNK> to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . 1.1708281368909708
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . " " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . " " I beg your pardon . 1.8957356524063758
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 3.8746751204561316
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time . 1.5848931924611136
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . " Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . 1.7301957388458942
II . 46.415888336127786
And , besides , no <UNK> of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then supposing them to be in London . 2.0092330025650473
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . 1.4773776525985112
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? 4.641588833612778
They were natural and just . 10.000000000000002
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written solely for their benefit . 1.3153690504363762
is she handsome ? " " She is a most charming young lady indeed . 3.359818286283782
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . 1.7082763938087104
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . 5.179474679231212
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . 1.8957356524063758
No , no , let me <UNK> for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret . 1.557068404753731
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . 1.6496480740980204
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . 1.557068404753731

It is almost past belief . 10.000000000000002
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 1.338388753173757
" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr . Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing after all . I consider it as one of the first <UNK> of polished societies . " " Certainly , Sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in <UNK> amongst the less polished societies of the world . Every <UNK> can dance . " Sir William only smiled . 1.353876180022544
I am ashamed of you ! 10.000000000000002
You are so strange ! 12.915496650148839
<UNK> wore a happier aspect . 10.000000000000002
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . 3.359818286283782
I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a <UNK> up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 2.0092330025650473
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the <UNK> ere long . " " Upon my word , Sir , " cried Elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . 1.53174046370208
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 1.8632463119315603
are sufficiently known . 17.78279410038923
When they were all in the drawing room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . 1.7534865500829584
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and <UNK> <UNK> her there . 2.9935772947204895
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and <UNK> every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the <UNK> of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 1.4977474763452014
" Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? 3.8746751204561316
<UNK> spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother in law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . 1.53174046370208
Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley . 3.1622776601683795
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . " The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . 1.7534865500829584
It was a large , handsome , <UNK> building , standing well on rising ground , and <UNK> by a <UNK> of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was <UNK> into greater , but without any <UNK> appearance . 1.5706464294715548
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> . 1.8957356524063758
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 2.7213387683753076
Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs . 5.878016072274914
By you , I was properly humbled . 6.812920690579612
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 1.53174046370208
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget ' had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ' Those were your words . 2.0535250264571463
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 3.359818286283782
" Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 1.3433993325989002
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <UNK> to her <UNK> , afforded no <UNK> of her distress . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . 2.51188643150958
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . 2.51188643150958
His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 2.346228848142263
intending to trace their route . 10.000000000000002
Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 2.8480358684358014
She is well , and <UNK> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . Your ' s , c . 2.4244620170823286
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very <UNK> reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to <UNK> and <UNK> to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 1.1721022975334803
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . 5.878016072274914
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . 2.2758459260747883
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 5.179474679231212
He leaves out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <UNK> . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must <UNK> reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility . 1.324192791886045
Elizabeth was delighted . 17.78279410038923
At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! 1.5199110829529336
There is a <UNK> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . 2.7213387683753076
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you . 2.346228848142263
Gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the <UNK> fashions . 2.7213387683753076
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <UNK> manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . 1.93069772888325
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . 1.8957356524063758
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! 4.216965034285822
Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . 2.9935772947204895
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 1.5085907086001784
But Mrs . 26.82695795279726
On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . 1.2843862635897427
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . 2.9935772947204895
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 12.915496650148839
The moral will be perfectly fair . 8.11130830789687
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 1.7082763938087104

At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . 1.8957356524063758
Bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone . 5.179474679231212
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . 2.2758459260747883
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . 2.346228848142263
This information , however , startled Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Its business office is located at North <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , . 3.1622776601683795
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his <UNK> were at the same time so vague and <UNK> , that her mother , though often <UNK> , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . 1.615598098439874
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . 1.9684194472866121
<UNK> or twice she could discern a <UNK> blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear . 2.7213387683753076
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more . 1.8632463119315603
<UNK> , of course . If you mention my name at the <UNK> , you will be attended to . " Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . 1.353876180022544
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 2.2758459260747883
I write rather slowly . " " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! 2.346228848142263
The Foundation ' s <UNK> or federal tax <UNK> number is . 4.216965034285822

They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <UNK> <UNK> and head <UNK> there is not much the matter with me . 1.6681005372000588
The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 1.615598098439874
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . 4.641588833612778
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . 2.346228848142263
Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with <UNK> civility that they were perfectly needless . 2.346228848142263
Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . 3.1622776601683795
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? 2.7213387683753076
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . " Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of <UNK> such reflections . 1.5085907086001784
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at <UNK> ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . 1.632172128563275
Oh , Lizzy ! 17.78279410038923
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head <UNK> acutely . 2.8480358684358014
I came to try you . 10.000000000000002
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . 4.216965034285822
He knows where we live . 10.000000000000002
Mr . Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . 2.154434690031884
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 3.593813663804627
" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech . 2.51188643150958
You thought me then <UNK> of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . 3.1622776601683795
" Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated . 3.593813663804627
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . 8.11130830789687
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . " Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire . 1.2376350284724815
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . 2.4244620170823286
" Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? 2.2758459260747883
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 1.2401035305418566

The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing room . 2.2758459260747883
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
To Mrs . 26.82695795279726
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . 3.593813663804627
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . 1.333521432163324
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . 2.7213387683753076
Their powers of conversation were considerable . 8.11130830789687
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits . 1.6876124757881477
You may have drawn him in . " " If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . " " Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? 1.8047217668271702
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . " " Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . 1.5998587196060583
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . 1.6496480740980204
I fancy she was wanted about the <UNK> <UNK> . 5.179474679231212
CHAPTER XVII . 26.82695795279726
Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . 4.216965034285822
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . 1.557068404753731
you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 1.2058708946926584
On entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book . 1.4677992676220695
Is not it so , Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which were scattered over the <UNK> lawn . 1.7534865500829584
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement <UNK> the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be <UNK> to make the <UNK> disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law . 1.6876124757881477
She now lost every expectation of pleasure . 6.812920690579612
She saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . 1.5848931924611136
What could your ladyship propose by it ? " " At once to insist upon having such a report universally <UNK> . " " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . " " If ! 1.3894954943731377
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . 2.0092330025650473
He seldom appeared really animated . 10.000000000000002
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . " " I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 1.2154742500762865
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 1.6681005372000588
Lydia ' s going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself . 2.1017480113324885
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a <UNK> , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! 2.1017480113324885
<UNK> , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . 4.641588833612778
The discussion of Mr . Collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . 1.6876124757881477
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself . 2.8480358684358014
I am the happiest creature in the world . 5.878016072274914
Gardiner was so little to be trusted . " " You must not blame my aunt . 2.9935772947204895
We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . 1.4677992676220695
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . " " Oh ! " said Lydia <UNK> , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , I ' <UNK> the <UNK> . " The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . 1.2915496650148839
She certainly did not hate him . 8.11130830789687
CHAPTER IX . 26.82695795279726
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 1.8329807108324359
When they repaired to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 1.7534865500829584
He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest <UNK> , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any <UNK> display of regard , or any <UNK> of manner , where their two <UNK> only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 1.3593563908785256
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
You know I have . 12.915496650148839
They found Mr . Bennet still up . 6.812920690579612
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <UNK> him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 1.5848931924611136
But she is perfectly amiable , and often <UNK> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . " " Has she been presented ? 2.0092330025650473
Come be quick , be quick ! 8.11130830789687
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . 5.878016072274914
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 2.9935772947204895
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 1.4585940117250362
Many small donations to , are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 2.51188643150958
But I suppose you had no opportunity . 6.812920690579612
Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 1.9684194472866121
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <UNK> family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . 1.6876124757881477
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . 4.216965034285822
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 6.812920690579612
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr . Darcy . She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! Yet it did , and even a third . 1.302994338575022
In the hall they parted . 10.000000000000002
She does not yet leave her dressing room . 5.878016072274914
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 1.2915496650148839
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . 1.2352165993694857
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 3.593813663804627
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . 3.1622776601683795
<UNK> me whilst you can . " " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . " " Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . " " I cannot believe it . 1.7534865500829584
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away . 1.8957356524063758
Let us hope for better things . 8.11130830789687
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish . 3.593813663804627
" They are going to be <UNK> near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! 2.2122162910704493
I cannot quite agree with you there . 6.812920690579612
To Caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit . 2.610157215682537
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the <UNK> . 1.4497406703726319
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 4.216965034285822
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 1.396135390856794

They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy . 1.4773776525985112
Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . " CHAPTER XIII . 2.51188643150958
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as <UNK> as herself . 1.6496480740980204
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . 1.7301957388458942
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it . 2.2122162910704493
" Where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door . 2.9935772947204895
When you told Mrs . 12.915496650148839
There was no help for it however . 6.812920690579612
But now it was all too natural . 6.812920690579612
What will you think of my vanity ? 6.812920690579612
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . " " But not before they went to Brighton ? " " No , I believe not . " " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? 1.5199110829529336
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house . 3.593813663804627
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . 3.8746751204561316
. F . . LIMITED <UNK> OF <UNK> OR <UNK> If you discover a defect in this electronic work within days of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from . 1.4977474763452014
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 5.878016072274914
Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , <UNK> that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ? 1.2115276586285884
do not repeat what I then said . 6.812920690579612
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . 2.0535250264571463
Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . 2.7213387683753076
When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs . 4.641588833612778
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . 2.610157215682537
The day of his and Lydia ' s departure soon came , and Mrs . 3.359818286283782
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 2.9935772947204895
Can I speak <UNK> ? 12.915496650148839
I will only add , God bless you . 5.878016072274914
I never saw such <UNK> , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " Mrs . 2.2758459260747883
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . " " I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want . " " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " No , indeed . 1.4497406703726319
Where does discretion end , and <UNK> begin ? 5.878016072274914
The path just admitted three . 10.000000000000002
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly <UNK> at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 2.2122162910704493
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her <UNK> . 1.5441135899948315
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage . 1.6876124757881477
It was all pride and <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 2.0092330025650473
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners <UNK> respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 1.53174046370208
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its <UNK> was visiting and news . 2.7213387683753076
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . 1.5199110829529336
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth <UNK> out the coffee , in so close a <UNK> , that there was not a single <UNK> near her , which would admit of a chair . 1.5998587196060583
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . 3.359818286283782
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . 1.8047217668271702
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs . 1.4030037231905736
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 1.3433993325989002
The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . 1.4977474763452014
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 1.7301957388458942
" You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 2.154434690031884
Sir William had been delighted with him . 6.812920690579612
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 2.0092330025650473
You must learn some of my philosophy . 6.812920690579612
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! 1.2175031274276027
" What do you think ? 10.000000000000002
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . " " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . 1.2560585988318853
But let me advise you to think better of it . 4.641588833612778
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! 1.7301957388458942
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment . 5.878016072274914
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her . 5.179474679231212
There ' s for you ! 10.000000000000002
" I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth . 3.8746751204561316
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 1.778279410038923
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
" They will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . 1.632172128563275
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday . 1.338388753173757
" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs . 3.359818286283782
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . 3.359818286283782
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . 4.216965034285822
Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . 1.8632463119315603
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general . 3.1622776601683795
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation . 2.4244620170823286
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . 4.216965034285822
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his <UNK> powers had gained him in the <UNK> . 1.5848931924611136
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <UNK> . " " And this is your real opinion ! 1.4174741629268053
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . 2.2122162910704493
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . 1.5199110829529336
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 1.5998587196060583
I will read you the passage which particularly <UNK> me . 4.641588833612778
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling . " " Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose . 2.0535250264571463
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be <UNK> to her nieces . 2.1017480113324885
He can be a <UNK> companion if he thinks it worth his while . 3.593813663804627
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? " " I think she will . 1.8957356524063758
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of <UNK> from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a <UNK> horse . 1.93069772888325
<UNK> and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was <UNK> and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil . 1.8957356524063758
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 2.346228848142263
Every <UNK> <UNK> in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther <UNK> of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago <UNK> his <UNK> in the affair ; that proud and <UNK> as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had <UNK> brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be <UNK> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <UNK> or <UNK> habits . 1.2260144114527525
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . 2.9935772947204895
" How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet ! 3.593813663804627
Who could about such a <UNK> little <UNK> thing ? " Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <UNK> and fancied liberal ! 1.5848931924611136
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . 1.6496480740980204
Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . 2.7213387683753076
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . " " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth <UNK> ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy ' s steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself . " " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a <UNK> . 1.2305240043592616
Poor dear child ! 17.78279410038923
Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her . 4.216965034285822
I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . 3.8746751204561316
Collins and myself sincerely <UNK> with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the <UNK> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 1.7301957388458942
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 2.610157215682537
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane " I hope and trust they will yet be happy . 1.6496480740980204
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or <UNK> distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more <UNK> blind . 1.53174046370208
On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . 1.7301957388458942
I am sure you must feel it so . " " Oh ! 3.8746751204561316
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an <UNK> of Mr . Darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . 1.7301957388458942
Poor Jane ! 26.82695795279726
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . 2.7213387683753076
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had <UNK> <UNK> only four months ago , would now have been <UNK> and gratefully received ! 1.778279410038923
How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! 3.359818286283782
CHAPTER XII . 26.82695795279726
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . 1.2077226551344626
Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . 2.8480358684358014
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother How is she ? 2.0092330025650473
Let me never see either one or the other again ! " Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no <UNK> , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re <UNK> the admiration of her former lover . 1.5199110829529336
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in <UNK> , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . 1.295267744355328
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 2.346228848142263
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . " " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 1.4497406703726319
Long . 46.415888336127786
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . 3.593813663804627
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 2.610157215682537

With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and <UNK> pass away . 1.8047217668271702
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . 2.51188643150958
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 1.93069772888325
You take delight in <UNK> me . 8.11130830789687
But really , Ma ' am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . 1.425102670302998
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . " To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . 1.7301957388458942

Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . 2.2122162910704493
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s . 2.4244620170823286

If he fears me , why come hither ? 5.878016072274914
It adds even another motive . 10.000000000000002
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins ' s correspondence for any consideration . 2.51188643150958
Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 2.346228848142263
He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . " " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . 1.8329807108324359
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained . 3.8746751204561316
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ' s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . 1.324192791886045
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <UNK> as these , what would have been her sensations ? 2.154434690031884
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . 1.6681005372000588

" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 2.0535250264571463
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . 1.8047217668271702
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 5.179474679231212
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . 3.1622776601683795
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . 1.4497406703726319
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome . 1.6876124757881477
But his pride , his abominable pride , his <UNK> avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in <UNK> , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . 1.3433993325989002
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . " " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " And how impossible in others ! " " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? " " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . 1.2305240043592616
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! 2.0092330025650473

Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by <UNK> to his sister . 1.8329807108324359
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <UNK> for Mr . Darcy ' s pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham . 1.1153042700165117
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or <UNK> reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . 1.302994338575022
" What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? 2.7213387683753076
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the per <UNK> . 1.6496480740980204
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . 1.3830728955554412
Lady Catherine de Bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . 2.51188643150958
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . 3.593813663804627
" Not yet , " replied Jane . 6.812920690579612

She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 2.4244620170823286
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ? 1.2843862635897427
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy .

At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . 1.5441135899948315
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . 1.9684194472866121

Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <UNK> her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 1.5441135899948315

Pray read on .

After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . 2.0535250264571463
Is not he a charming man ? 8.11130830789687
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 1.7082763938087104
The <UNK> <UNK> of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in <UNK> with her opinion of each . 1.4773776525985112
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . " He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 1.2305240043592616
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <UNK> , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 2.0535250264571463
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 2.9935772947204895
<UNK> as she was to admit an idea so <UNK> of Jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the <UNK> of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . 1.8329807108324359
He was full of joy and attention . 6.812920690579612
The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . 1.7301957388458942
Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477

She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband . 5.179474679231212
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . 2.8480358684358014

" Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . 1.53174046370208

Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . 4.216965034285822
Yours ever , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " With the officers ! " cried Lydia . 2.9935772947204895
By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <UNK> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 1.7534865500829584
" But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not <UNK> his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . 1.6876124757881477
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 2.1017480113324885
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , <UNK> painful to me . 1.7534865500829584
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . " " Oh ! 1.7534865500829584
CHAPTER XVI . 26.82695795279726
Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . 2.610157215682537
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . 2.9935772947204895
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 1.4677992676220695
But here he was set right by Mrs . 5.878016072274914
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . 5.179474679231212
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 2.7213387683753076
Let me mend it for you . 8.11130830789687
Good bye . 26.82695795279726
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the <UNK> of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 1.4773776525985112
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . 3.8746751204561316
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 1.4497406703726319
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . 3.8746751204561316
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 1.8047217668271702
Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time . 2.9935772947204895
They contained no actual <UNK> , nor was there any <UNK> of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 2.4244620170823286
But self , though it would intrude , could not <UNK> her . 3.8746751204561316
" Don ' t keep <UNK> so , Kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! 3.1622776601683795
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? 4.641588833612778
Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
Bennet was most <UNK> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 1.4773776525985112
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever <UNK> , and the <UNK> friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . 1.4873521072935114
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . 1.8632463119315603
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . " " My dear , you flatter me . 1.4873521072935114
" <UNK> resentment is a shade in a character . 5.179474679231212
Not handsome enough to dance with ! 8.11130830789687
I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . " " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . 1.4677992676220695
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . 1.4497406703726319
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " <UNK> so I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . 1.2742749857031337
A small sum could not do all this . " " No , " said her father , " Wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a <UNK> less than ten thousand pounds . 1.7301957388458942
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . 4.216965034285822
Her ladyship ' s carriage is <UNK> ordered for us . 4.641588833612778
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <UNK> . 3.1622776601683795
For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently . 2.154434690031884
I congratulate her . 17.78279410038923
Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him . 1.2195704601594413
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and <UNK> them , after a short <UNK> , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . 1.7301957388458942
And then when we came away it was such fun ! 4.641588833612778
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . 1.615598098439874
I don ' t know . 10.000000000000002
Without a governess you must have been neglected . " " <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . 1.8047217668271702
III . 46.415888336127786
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . 2.2122162910704493
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . 3.1622776601683795
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 2.51188643150958
Sir William did not say much . 8.11130830789687
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States . 2.8480358684358014
It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ? 2.9935772947204895
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs . 6.812920690579612
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 3.1622776601683795
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . " Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . 1.3708385261355818
" What can be the meaning of this ! " said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone . 2.610157215682537
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . 1.53174046370208
And poor Mr . Darcy ! 10.000000000000002
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 1.1954168684575872
You see on what a footing we are . 5.878016072274914
Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated . 1.5085907086001784
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 3.359818286283782
But though every thing seemed <UNK> and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <UNK> ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . 1.615598098439874
He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable house . 2.8480358684358014
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . " Mr . Bingley followed his advice . 2.0092330025650473
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . 3.1622776601683795
She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . 1.8329807108324359
Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father . 1.632172128563275
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . 1.7301957388458942
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and <UNK> , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <UNK> her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . 1.3433993325989002
Long will do any such thing . 8.11130830789687
Their fortune on both sides is splendid . 6.812920690579612
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 3.593813663804627
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 1.7301957388458942
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . 2.2122162910704493
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 2.8480358684358014
I did for you . 12.915496650148839
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 1.4497406703726319
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . 2.9935772947204895
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . 2.51188643150958
She has known him only a fortnight . 6.812920690579612
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 2.51188643150958
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 3.359818286283782
Not that I care about it , though . 5.878016072274914
The officers will find women better worth their notice . 5.179474679231212
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . 2.7213387683753076
A person may be proud without being vain . 5.878016072274914
<UNK> you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say , three very silly sisters . 1.7534865500829584
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . 2.4244620170823286
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . 3.593813663804627
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 1.9684194472866121
They could describe an entertainment with <UNK> , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . 2.4244620170823286
After a short pause , her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me . 2.7213387683753076
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral <UNK> from the evil before them . 2.610157215682537
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . 2.610157215682537
After playing some <UNK> <UNK> , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to <UNK> such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " She smiled , but made no answer . 1.4174741629268053
and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! 4.641588833612778
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . 2.1017480113324885
She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . 2.0535250264571463
It is unaccountable ! 17.78279410038923
Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . 3.593813663804627
c . " Mr . Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . 1.8632463119315603
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 1.3768571648527583
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a <UNK> ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 1.4873521072935114
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . 2.2122162910704493
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 2.4244620170823286
Illustration <UNK> <UNK> PRIDE PREJUDICE . 10.000000000000002
They had frequently been staying with her in town . 5.179474679231212
She was humbled , she was grieved ; she <UNK> , though she hardly knew of what . 2.8480358684358014
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . 2.154434690031884
By nature <UNK> , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James ' s had made him <UNK> . 2.51188643150958
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . 1.557068404753731
Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s <UNK> , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any <UNK> of sentiment . If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error . 1.3433993325989002
His character was to speak for itself . 6.812920690579612
They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . 2.2122162910704493
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now . 3.593813663804627
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . 1.632172128563275
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago . " " I have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said Mrs . 1.8632463119315603
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 2.2758459260747883
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an <UNK> man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a <UNK> , had nothing to say to her . 1.3894954943731377
Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . 1.8957356524063758
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 1.8632463119315603
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . 2.9935772947204895
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . 2.2758459260747883
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . 4.216965034285822
It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement . 2.0092330025650473
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . 5.179474679231212
The Foundation is <UNK> to complying with the laws <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> donations in all states of the United States . 2.4244620170823286
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . 5.179474679231212
Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed . 1.365007806546014
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . " " Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . 1.5441135899948315
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . 6.812920690579612
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 1.5706464294715548
He danced only four dances ! 10.000000000000002
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 1.4330125702369627
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she . 3.593813663804627
Now is your time . 12.915496650148839
But there are two things that I want very much to know one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . " " <UNK> ! 1.5998587196060583
CHAPTER VII . 26.82695795279726
Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 2.610157215682537
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week . 1.615598098439874
You mentioned two instances . 12.915496650148839
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! <UNK> our surprise . 1.5441135899948315
CHAPTER XIV . 26.82695795279726
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . 1.4977474763452014
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious . 1.3287913432286882
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr . Darcy ' s steward . 1.2742749857031337
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . 2.346228848142263
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . 5.878016072274914
My watchfulness has been <UNK> ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I <UNK> in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance . 1.7082763938087104
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . 4.216965034285822
Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 2.1017480113324885
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . 1.7082763938087104
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you ! 3.359818286283782
As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters . 1.6876124757881477
Are the others coming out ? " " I do not know . 3.8746751204561316
He had to be sure done much . 6.812920690579612
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . " Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . 2.154434690031884
Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . 3.359818286283782
They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins ' s admiration . 3.593813663804627
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . 1.4773776525985112
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 1.557068404753731
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . 1.6496480740980204
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother ' s schemes . 1.5706464294715548
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . 1.93069772888325
Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy . 1.8329807108324359
The hill , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . 2.2122162910704493
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . 2.610157215682537
it must be my uncle ' s doings ! 5.878016072274914
What did Colonel Forster say ? 10.000000000000002
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . 2.2758459260747883
My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . 1.5085907086001784
He had never had the slightest suspicion . 6.812920690579612
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so <UNK> that I cannot answer for being <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their <UNK> concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 2.2122162910704493
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . 4.216965034285822
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . 3.359818286283782
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . 2.154434690031884
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . 1.8632463119315603
who could have done less for her ? 6.812920690579612
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 1.632172128563275
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character . 2.7213387683753076
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away . 1.8957356524063758
" I cannot see why Mrs . 8.11130830789687
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! 2.9935772947204895
She will not be able to help calling . " " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 1.338388753173757
<UNK> , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . 3.8746751204561316
She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most <UNK> by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . 1.6681005372000588
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . 1.3830728955554412
But papa is so disagreeable . " " A little <UNK> bathing would set me up for ever . " " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty . 1.6681005372000588
My sisters may write to me . 8.11130830789687
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 1.41011239906908
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child . 2.154434690031884
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious <UNK> , denoted a recollection of Jane , not <UNK> by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . 1.4677992676220695
Very well . 26.82695795279726
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . 2.0092330025650473
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed ! 4.216965034285822
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , <UNK> over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in <UNK> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 1.3708385261355818
Mr . Darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . 4.641588833612778
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 2.2758459260747883
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . 1.319720393061375
" But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . " " <UNK> , headstrong girl ! 1.6496480740980204
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . 1.3485595530525598
His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . 1.8632463119315603
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . 4.641588833612778
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a <UNK> table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the <UNK> of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . 1.4030037231905736
It originated in Mrs . 12.915496650148839
This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . 2.51188643150958
The vague and unsettled suspicions which <UNK> had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 1.365007806546014
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <UNK> what <UNK> felicity really was . 2.9935772947204895
They have at least that advantage . " " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . 2.0092330025650473
It cannot be concealed from any one . 6.812920690579612
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 2.2122162910704493
She then <UNK> again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . " " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . " " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something <UNK> <UNK> in the usual <UNK> of such a meeting . 1.1201110555062403
It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . 2.1017480113324885
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 2.4244620170823286
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . 2.346228848142263
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new <UNK> . 2.154434690031884
" Yes if Darcy does not put it off again . 4.641588833612778
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 1.6496480740980204
Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in <UNK> , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and <UNK> a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire . 1.2451970847350329
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . 1.93069772888325
To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough . 3.1622776601683795
what news ? 26.82695795279726
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 3.593813663804627
Your mother <UNK> upon your accepting it . 6.812920690579612
From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 2.4244620170823286
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him . 2.9935772947204895
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy ' s regard . " " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? " " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . " " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy . 1.4030037231905736
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . 1.7301957388458942
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them . 1.4585940117250362
Again she read on . 12.915496650148839
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 2.610157215682537
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 1.6876124757881477
He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . " I wish I could call her amiable . 1.3830728955554412
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 1.4677992676220695

Bennet . 46.415888336127786
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away . 3.359818286283782
Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! Yes certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . " And <UNK> her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma ' am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr . Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . 1.2648552168552962
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . 1.93069772888325
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . 2.9935772947204895
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 3.8746751204561316
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> . 2.0092330025650473
Mr . Darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding . 4.216965034285822
By Mrs . 26.82695795279726
CHAPTER XVIII . 26.82695795279726
Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ' s arm <UNK> to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s . 1.9684194472866121
Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . " " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . 1.5706464294715548
<UNK> sons cannot marry where they like . " " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . " " Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . " " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl ' s younger son ? 1.228247006346923
But that is one great difference between us . 5.878016072274914
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 1.615598098439874
You refuse , then , to oblige me . 5.878016072274914
From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day . 1.4497406703726319
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 1.53174046370208
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . 1.7082763938087104
Your ' s , very sincerely , " <UNK> . 5.179474679231212

Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . 6.812920690579612
They must be a great loss to your family . " In Darcy ' s presence she dared not mention Wickham ' s name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <UNK> in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , <UNK> herself <UNK> to <UNK> the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . 1.338388753173757
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage . 2.4244620170823286
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good <UNK> will <UNK> it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth <UNK> lest her mother should be exposing herself again . 1.5441135899948315
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 2.1017480113324885
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it . 1.7082763938087104
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . 1.778279410038923
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . 1.4030037231905736
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . 2.4244620170823286
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year . 2.0535250264571463
Mr . Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . 2.4244620170823286
They <UNK> their wretchedness , however , by <UNK> after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . 1.632172128563275
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . " Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . 1.3708385261355818

Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ? 3.8746751204561316
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . 2.51188643150958
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 1.5848931924611136
I promised them so <UNK> ! 10.000000000000002
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an <UNK> on every subject . 3.593813663804627
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 2.51188643150958
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . 2.4244620170823286
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . 1.5199110829529336
CHAPTER VIII . 26.82695795279726
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the <UNK> , but of that I <UNK> . 1.7082763938087104
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease . 1.2809343786525484
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . 1.8047217668271702
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . 1.41011239906908
" <UNK> <UNK> . " CHAPTER XIII . 6.812920690579612
who attended to you ? 12.915496650148839
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? 3.8746751204561316
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . 3.8746751204561316
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay . 2.8480358684358014
They entered it in one of its <UNK> points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , <UNK> over a wide extent . 2.154434690031884
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . 2.0535250264571463
Collins was settled near her family . " " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . 2.610157215682537
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder . 2.4244620170823286
It was to this effect " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well . 1.6876124757881477
She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 2.610157215682537
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? 1.93069772888325
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . 3.593813663804627
When is your turn to come ? 8.11130830789687
When this was done , she had a less active part to play . 3.593813663804627
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 1.6496480740980204
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . 2.8480358684358014
" If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . 2.2758459260747883
That his anger could be carried to such a point of <UNK> resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem <UNK> , exceeded all that she could believe possible . 1.7082763938087104
<UNK> on Jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy ' s explanation , by <UNK> Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 1.7082763938087104
" I expected at least that the <UNK> were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! " " La ! 2.0092330025650473
it is of no consequence . 10.000000000000002
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <UNK> . 1.8047217668271702
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . 2.8480358684358014
She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <UNK> in so small a family as her ' s , and <UNK> her as to the care of her <UNK> and her poultry . 1.4174741629268053
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 1.425102670302998
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my <UNK> . " " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . 1.9684194472866121
I know your disposition , Lizzy . 8.11130830789687
Collins , you must send a servant with them . 5.179474679231212
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to <UNK> people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? 1.6496480740980204
The second began . 17.78279410038923
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! 3.359818286283782
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to <UNK> , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to <UNK> his prosperous love . 1.3708385261355818
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 1.5199110829529336
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane . 1.8957356524063758
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . 3.359818286283782
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . 2.2122162910704493
" I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five <UNK> any object . 1.557068404753731
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . 2.9935772947204895
Let her go then . 12.915496650148839
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . 1.4677992676220695
And it was settled that we should all be there by <UNK> o ' clock . 3.1622776601683795
" She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . 2.9935772947204895
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented . 2.8480358684358014
It will save me a world of trouble and economy . 4.641588833612778
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . 3.8746751204561316
We do not suffer by accident . 8.11130830789687
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 2.610157215682537
Mr . Bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . 1.4174741629268053
Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . " Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . 1.8329807108324359
I am quite well . 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation . 2.0092330025650473
What are we to do ! " would they often <UNK> in the bitterness of <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 2.51188643150958
His <UNK> to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 2.2758459260747883
Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . 2.154434690031884
She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . 1.4677992676220695
She was overpowered by shame and vexation . 6.812920690579612
" I found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr . Darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . " She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . 1.2096079377043663
Mr . Collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . 3.593813663804627
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <UNK> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 1.9684194472866121
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 3.8746751204561316
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 1.2505106035854068
They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . 3.593813663804627
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , <UNK> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . 1.4873521072935114
Every kind of pride must <UNK> from the connection . 5.179474679231212
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 1.5848931924611136
In this <UNK> state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 1.3593563908785256
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 2.0535250264571463
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . 2.2758459260747883
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse . 5.878016072274914
I hope they will not meet at all . 5.878016072274914
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . 1.5848931924611136
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so . 2.7213387683753076
Let me hear from you very soon . 6.812920690579612
But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . 1.8047217668271702
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 1.8329807108324359
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . " " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . 1.16957266874034
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish . 1.1905772393787835
Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . 2.2122162910704493
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 1.9684194472866121
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 3.8746751204561316
On the following Monday , Mrs . 8.11130830789687
I cannot do justice to his kindness . 6.812920690579612
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law . " The loss of her daughter made Mrs . 2.154434690031884
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . 3.8746751204561316
<UNK> as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> . 1.5848931924611136
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . 2.1017480113324885
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . 2.0535250264571463
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . 4.216965034285822
He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his <UNK> to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm . 1.632172128563275
We will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen . 3.359818286283782
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth ! 3.1622776601683795
He was well , but so much engaged with Mr . Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . 2.610157215682537
Elizabeth , after slightly <UNK> it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . 3.1622776601683795
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . 2.0092330025650473
My mother was in <UNK> , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! 1.8329807108324359
After <UNK> their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ? 1.93069772888325
Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . 1.5199110829529336
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . 4.216965034285822
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 1.557068404753731
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <UNK> ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had <UNK> , in his offer to herself . 1.557068404753731
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <UNK> , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 1.6876124757881477
My poor father ! 17.78279410038923
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 3.359818286283782
Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . 2.9935772947204895
Her report was highly favourable . 10.000000000000002
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man . 1.8047217668271702
The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . 2.8480358684358014
Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the <UNK> ? 1.7301957388458942
In Three Volumes . 17.78279410038923
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Had it been your uncle ' s doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . 2.0092330025650473
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . 1.6496480740980204
Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 2.1017480113324885
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . " " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the <UNK> manner which I see so many women ' s do . 1.5199110829529336
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their <UNK> , <UNK> , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty ' s and Lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it . 1.4677992676220695
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw . 1.9684194472866121
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 1.396135390856794
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 1.5199110829529336
Mr . Collins was carefully <UNK> them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <UNK> them . 1.778279410038923
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece . 2.346228848142263
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly <UNK> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . 1.6681005372000588
Mr . what ' s his name . 6.812920690579612
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . 3.593813663804627
" John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? " " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 1.7534865500829584
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over <UNK> evils , or <UNK> them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . 2.0092330025650473
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two . 3.1622776601683795
It was very little less . 10.000000000000002
" If he wants our society , let him seek it . 4.216965034285822
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . 5.179474679231212
In Lydia ' s imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of <UNK> happiness . 2.9935772947204895
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
but no one can throw any blame on them . 5.179474679231212
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and Mrs . 1.7301957388458942
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . 2.346228848142263
She is grown so <UNK> and <UNK> ! 6.812920690579612
But she is too much like her brother , very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . 1.6681005372000588
I will not tell you what it is . 5.878016072274914
From that moment I observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 1.8632463119315603
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride . 3.8746751204561316
Gardiner . 46.415888336127786
" No ; but it must be done soon . " Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . 2.1017480113324885
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 2.7213387683753076
" Yours , c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a <UNK> fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . " " Oh ! 1.365007806546014
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . 2.7213387683753076
His attachment to Rosings , certainly <UNK> . " Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 1.8047217668271702
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s . 3.1622776601683795
" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . " " I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice . 1.4030037231905736
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . 2.9935772947204895
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <UNK> . 1.5706464294715548
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . 3.359818286283782
Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the <UNK> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . 1.3768571648527583
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . 2.154434690031884
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . 1.615598098439874
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 4.641588833612778
The extravagance and general <UNK> which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 1.7534865500829584
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . " Elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . 2.2758459260747883
From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an <UNK> chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . 1.5706464294715548
I send no compliments to your mother . 6.812920690579612
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 1.615598098439874
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 2.154434690031884
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself . 2.346228848142263
GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 1.8957356524063758
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> . 4.216965034285822
How I long to see her ! 8.11130830789687
Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . 2.51188643150958
" I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ' s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . 1.7534865500829584

Brighton , and a whole <UNK> of <UNK> , to us , who have been <UNK> already by one poor regiment of militia , and the <UNK> balls of Meryton . " " Now I have got some news for you , " said Lydia , as they sat down to table . 1.4977474763452014
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . 2.0092330025650473
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 3.8746751204561316
Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . 1.93069772888325
Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 2.0535250264571463
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so <UNK> courted you . 1.53174046370208
But in what <UNK> it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . 2.610157215682537
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . 1.8047217668271702
I am impatient to see him . " " In point of <UNK> , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective . 2.154434690031884
" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! " said she . 3.8746751204561316
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . 2.610157215682537
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , <UNK> Lucases . 1.8957356524063758
The children have been wanting me this half hour . 5.179474679231212
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . 3.1622776601683795
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . " " My beauty you had early <UNK> , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . 1.4677992676220695
Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ' s <UNK> enough to <UNK> him from its <UNK> , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never <UNK> without him . " " So much the better . 1.4330125702369627
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . " Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where Mrs . 1.2532543355087804
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <UNK> by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . 1.53174046370208
Why must their marriage be private ? 8.11130830789687
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but I will venture to say that my <UNK> and <UNK> are not usually <UNK> by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of <UNK> ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . Pardon me . It pains me to offend you . 1.0893682693775035
Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , <UNK> him I believe very early in life . 1.7301957388458942
I speak nothing but the truth . 8.11130830789687
For forty years , he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose <UNK> of <UNK> support . 2.51188643150958
In the dining room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before . 1.9684194472866121
She performed her part indeed without much <UNK> , but Mrs . 4.216965034285822
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . 1.6876124757881477
and so did Mrs . 12.915496650148839
" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . " " You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . 2.154434690031884
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? 3.359818286283782
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . 4.641588833612778
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 2.0535250264571463
At present we have nothing to guide us . 5.878016072274914
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 1.778279410038923
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 1.365007806546014
But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my <UNK> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . 1.557068404753731
CHAPTER XIII . 26.82695795279726
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and <UNK> of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their <UNK> . 1.3830728955554412
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 2.0092330025650473
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . 2.8480358684358014
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . 1.8047217668271702
She wrote cheerfully , seemed <UNK> with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . 2.8480358684358014
Whatever bears affinity to <UNK> is <UNK> . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 2.2122162910704493
<UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill . 5.878016072274914
She was ashamed to think how much . 6.812920690579612
Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . 1.557068404753731
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 2.2758459260747883
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B . 4.641588833612778
She had got rid of two of the <UNK> which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . 1.7301957388458942
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 2.610157215682537
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one <UNK> idea of any thing . 2.154434690031884
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed . 2.2758459260747883
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short <UNK> . " " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . 1.4677992676220695
When I last saw her , she was not very promising . 4.216965034285822
I knew you would be wishing me joy . " " Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . 1.9684194472866121
But now it comes out . " " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows . 2.8480358684358014
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! How much of good or evil must be done by him ! 1.5441135899948315
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 1.4030037231905736
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . " " If I were as rich as Mr . Darcy , " cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , " I should not care how proud I was . 1.4977474763452014
" Yours , c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . 1.8329807108324359
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . " " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . " " Pride , " observed Mary , who <UNK> herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe . 1.3708385261355818
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to <UNK> from the <UNK> qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . 2.0092330025650473
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it . 1.3111339374215643
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . 3.593813663804627
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . 2.7213387683753076
" Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " for Mrs . 2.610157215682537
Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the <UNK> of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . 1.615598098439874
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . 2.2758459260747883
CHAPTER V . 26.82695795279726
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . 3.359818286283782
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . 1.7301957388458942
" My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . " But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . 1.2809343786525484
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be <UNK> so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . 2.0092330025650473
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for <UNK> Lodge , the <UNK> are dreadful . " Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained . 1.7082763938087104
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 1.6876124757881477
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . 1.5706464294715548
Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 1.632172128563275
" I never heard any thing so abominable . 5.878016072274914
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 1.6496480740980204
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . " " Oh ! 2.2758459260747883
It became her turn to listen . 8.11130830789687
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 3.359818286283782
Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . 1.5199110829529336
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <UNK> of elegant nuptials , fine <UNK> , new carriages , and servants . 1.4977474763452014
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 2.0535250264571463
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . 2.9935772947204895
Pray do not talk of that odious man . 5.878016072274914
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . 2.8480358684358014
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity . 1.4174741629268053
What say you , Mary ? 10.000000000000002
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . 1.4497406703726319
<UNK> recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed . 1.4977474763452014
I did not expect such a compliment . " " Did not you ? 3.593813663804627
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 1.4585940117250362
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 2.9935772947204895
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! 5.179474679231212
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 2.154434690031884
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been <UNK> , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . 1.6876124757881477
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . 3.8746751204561316
Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 2.4244620170823286
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 1.53174046370208
You have employed your time much better . 6.812920690579612
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 4.641588833612778
You are a gentleman ' s daughter . 6.812920690579612
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . 4.641588833612778
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 3.1622776601683795
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence . 1.4773776525985112
<UNK> is subject to the trademark license , especially <UNK> <UNK> . 4.216965034285822
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . 5.179474679231212
She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> . 1.6496480740980204
Gardiner smiled . 26.82695795279726
Collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too . 1.7534865500829584
But it is of small importance . " " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and <UNK> me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? 1.4773776525985112
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . 4.216965034285822
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 1.2775649214671148
" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt . 2.2122162910704493
It would be dreadful ! 12.915496650148839
And a special licence . 12.915496650148839
These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 2.0535250264571463
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . 4.216965034285822
The others have been gone on to <UNK> , these three weeks . " She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . 1.7301957388458942
Jane looked a little <UNK> than usual , but more <UNK> than Elizabeth had expected . 3.1622776601683795
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . 1.4873521072935114
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy . 1.93069772888325
Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . 3.359818286283782
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned . 1.4497406703726319
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 1.4330125702369627
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . " " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . " " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . " " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . " " But consider your daughters . 1.3111339374215643
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her <UNK> , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . 1.632172128563275
" Oh , Lizzy ! 12.915496650148839
CHAPTER VIII . 26.82695795279726
Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and <UNK> its extent . 3.8746751204561316
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 2.346228848142263
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 2.4244620170823286
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? 3.359818286283782
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 1.53174046370208
So high and so conceited that there was no <UNK> him ! 4.216965034285822
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . 2.154434690031884
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 1.5706464294715548
Why does she not come in ? " " Oh ! 4.641588833612778
<UNK> rules , set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG tm concept and trademark . 1.778279410038923
I knew that Mr . Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . 3.8746751204561316
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <UNK> , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house . 1.41011239906908
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . 1.6496480740980204
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . 1.1954168684575872
<UNK> back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write <UNK> . 2.9935772947204895
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do ! 3.593813663804627
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 3.359818286283782
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . 1.6496480740980204
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . 1.7534865500829584
In ran Mrs . 17.78279410038923
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . 3.359818286283782
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs . 1.8329807108324359
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . " CHAPTER VI . 1.5706464294715548
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " <UNK> you ! 2.9935772947204895
You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . 2.610157215682537
The supposition did not pain her . 8.11130830789687
Thank God ! 26.82695795279726
Bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " Well , Jane , who is it from ? 1.9684194472866121
so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! 5.878016072274914
I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . 1.396135390856794
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 3.359818286283782
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . 1.6876124757881477
I want to talk very seriously . 8.11130830789687
The <UNK> letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 1.8329807108324359
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears <UNK> the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the <UNK> . 1.8957356524063758
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 1.9684194472866121
<UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . " " We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . " " But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs . 1.302994338575022
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 1.7301957388458942
At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . 2.7213387683753076
Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . 1.632172128563275
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman <UNK> the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . 1.3768571648527583
The garden <UNK> to the road , the house standing in it , the <UNK> pales and the <UNK> <UNK> , every thing declared they were <UNK> . 2.0535250264571463
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 2.0535250264571463
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 1.5706464294715548
It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long . 3.1622776601683795
Philips were now <UNK> of the most interesting intelligence . 5.179474679231212
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . 2.8480358684358014
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . 1.53174046370208
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including <UNK> , online payments and credit card donations . 2.7213387683753076
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 1.8957356524063758
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . " " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be . 1.2618568830660204
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . 4.216965034285822
Lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon <UNK> up every private care ; and covering her face with her <UNK> , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . 1.2154742500762865
What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . 2.346228848142263
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 3.359818286283782
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . 4.216965034285822
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . 4.641588833612778
CHAPTER IV . 26.82695795279726
" I am sure there is not on his . 5.179474679231212
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , <UNK> , <UNK> , or the <UNK> . 1.53174046370208
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . 1.8957356524063758
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the <UNK> light , seemed most improbable . 2.7213387683753076
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 6.812920690579612
Is not general incivility the very <UNK> of love ? " " Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . 2.0092330025650473
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long . 2.4244620170823286
" If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . 1.9684194472866121
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . 1.2843862635897427
There is no indignity so <UNK> to their feelings ! " She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " " And quite alone ? 1.425102670302998
<UNK> , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . 1.557068404753731
This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham . 1.5848931924611136
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . 2.1017480113324885
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? " " That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . 1.8632463119315603
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over . 2.154434690031884
She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . 3.593813663804627
" It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . 3.1622776601683795
" I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends . 2.2758459260747883
There could not <UNK> in the world two men , over whom Mr . Darcy could have such <UNK> influence . 2.51188643150958
Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . 2.2758459260747883
Her own thoughts were <UNK> her . 8.11130830789687
So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 2.610157215682537
She will be down in a moment I dare say . " He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 1.8329807108324359
it is just as he <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side . 1.8957356524063758
Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 1.4030037231905736
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy . 2.610157215682537
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 5.179474679231212
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . 5.179474679231212
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . 2.610157215682537
On Saturday he came again . 10.000000000000002
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long . 3.359818286283782
I . 46.415888336127786
See paragraph . C below . 10.000000000000002
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest <UNK> ; his <UNK> contracted , his air gloomy . 2.1017480113324885
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 3.359818286283782
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 4.641588833612778
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 2.8480358684358014
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 2.346228848142263
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley ' s heart were entertained . 2.0535250264571463
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . 2.610157215682537
Will you come and see me ? " " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . " " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . 1.8632463119315603
" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s <UNK> in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . 1.4677992676220695
He has children of his own , and may have more . 4.216965034285822
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . 1.425102670302998
Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 2.0092330025650473
" So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find . 2.51188643150958
" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 1.3894954943731377
Four nieces of Mrs . 12.915496650148839
How are you all ? " " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 2.346228848142263
I enquired after their brother , of course . 5.878016072274914
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go . 5.179474679231212
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " " <UNK> do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 1.3287913432286882
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . 2.2122162910704493
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 3.593813663804627
Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 2.2758459260747883
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . 3.359818286283782
The pause was to Elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful . 5.179474679231212
" Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 1.778279410038923
What shall we do with him ? 8.11130830789687
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <UNK> with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 1.9684194472866121
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 1.5085907086001784
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . 2.0092330025650473
Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . 1.3485595530525598
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . 1.8632463119315603
Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described . 3.593813663804627
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . 3.359818286283782
It will pass away soon enough . " " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty . 1.5706464294715548
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 6.812920690579612
The pain of separation , however , might be <UNK> on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . 1.4873521072935114
" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? " " To morrow fortnight . " " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . 1.8329807108324359
If , indeed , it should be so ! 5.878016072274914
" While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . 1.93069772888325
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply <UNK> on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . 1.778279410038923
This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 5.179474679231212
I had not an idea of it . " Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . 1.778279410038923
He has more to give . 10.000000000000002
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <UNK> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . 1.2618568830660204
CHAPTER XII . 26.82695795279726
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . 1.8632463119315603
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give <UNK> confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr . Darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr . Darcy in a most infamous manner . 1.3830728955554412
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy . 1.8957356524063758
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . 3.359818286283782
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
What is to become of us ! 8.11130830789687
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 1.5085907086001784
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <UNK> , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her <UNK> and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , Lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . 1.4174741629268053
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 6.812920690579612
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " " You have . 1.5199110829529336
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a <UNK> . 1.353876180022544
Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody ' s reserve , can be answerable for the event . 2.0535250264571463
Good girl ! 26.82695795279726
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . 5.878016072274914
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . 2.8480358684358014
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . 4.641588833612778
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . 1.2451970847350329
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . 5.179474679231212
" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be <UNK> , for <UNK> I must call it . " " It is wonderful , " replied Wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 1.319720393061375
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 1.5848931924611136
Bennet with civil self command to Miss Lucas . 5.878016072274914
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . 2.1017480113324885
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected . 4.641588833612778
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . " " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley . 1.7082763938087104
They soon <UNK> the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 2.154434690031884
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 1.4412195967188537
but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley ' s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the <UNK> have no horses to theirs . " " I had much rather go in the coach . " " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure . 1.4873521072935114
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 1.9684194472866121
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . 2.9935772947204895
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 1.5441135899948315
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister ' s being in town . 2.51188643150958
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . 1.324192791886045
Mr . Darcy <UNK> you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . 2.7213387683753076
He is a pleasant fellow , and would <UNK> you <UNK> . " " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 2.0535250264571463
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
One day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual . 2.0092330025650473
<UNK> back the servant , therefore , she <UNK> him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost <UNK> , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly . 1.8632463119315603
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . 4.641588833612778
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 4.216965034285822
But what is that to me ? 8.11130830789687
And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? 2.0092330025650473
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 4.216965034285822
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 1.319720393061375
that abominable Mr . Darcy ! My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to <UNK> it . 2.0535250264571463
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . 1.5706464294715548
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? 3.8746751204561316
" I did not know that you intended to walk , " said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . 2.154434690031884
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . 2.51188643150958
Darcy said nothing at all . 10.000000000000002
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled . 2.154434690031884
" She is so fond of Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . 4.641588833612778
I dearly love a laugh . " " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . 2.154434690031884
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 1.5848931924611136
It was all conjecture . " " What is it you mean ? " " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing . " " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . " " And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . 1.3153690504363762
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . 2.4244620170823286
Bennet said only , " <UNK> , nonsense ! " " What can be the meaning of that <UNK> exclamation ? " cried he . 2.2122162910704493
Yes , yes . 17.78279410038923
<UNK> is impossible ; <UNK> , <UNK> . 6.812920690579612
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 3.359818286283782
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 1.5706464294715548
" Not at all . 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 2.7213387683753076
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . 4.216965034285822
She could not <UNK> him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on . 2.4244620170823286
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 2.2122162910704493
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 1.3485595530525598
Her hair so <UNK> , so <UNK> ! " " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six <UNK> deep in <UNK> , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . " " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me . 1.338388753173757
CHAPTER I . 26.82695795279726
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . 3.8746751204561316
That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <UNK> in town , as Mr . Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . 1.3894954943731377
Bennet . They had several children . 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . 1.4330125702369627
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . 6.812920690579612
Jenkinson were sitting . Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . 2.610157215682537
A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone . 3.1622776601683795
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 2.4244620170823286
It was a large , well <UNK> room , handsomely fitted up . 3.8746751204561316
Lady Catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . 2.7213387683753076
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it <UNK> . 1.5199110829529336
Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well . 2.9935772947204895
The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for <UNK> as may be <UNK> to himself and not offensive to his patron . 1.778279410038923
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? 3.1622776601683795
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own . 1.396135390856794
With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . 1.8047217668271702
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your ' s seems to have been . 2.2122162910704493
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself . 2.4244620170823286
The Miss <UNK> all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . Do you draw ? " " No , not at all . " " What , none of you ? " " Not one . " " That is very strange . 1.5085907086001784
You never see a fault in any body . 5.878016072274914
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 1.41011239906908
Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit . 1.5848931924611136
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so <UNK> to you . 1.4497406703726319
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 1.2742749857031337
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 1.8047217668271702
Bennet , " to walk to <UNK> Mount this morning . 4.641588833612778
Of this she was perfectly <UNK> ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . 1.8632463119315603
" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides <UNK> tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! " Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . 1.324192791886045
Good bye . " She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she <UNK> about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . 1.9684194472866121
Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <UNK> at whist , enumerating all the <UNK> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he <UNK> his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . 1.5441135899948315
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " CHAPTER XVIII . 2.8480358684358014
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold enough to say before how much I like him . 1.8329807108324359
" This is wholly unexpected . 10.000000000000002
As no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins ' s scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . 1.93069772888325
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . 1.8329807108324359
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day . " " Oh , yes . 1.9684194472866121
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . 3.8746751204561316
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 1.4497406703726319
" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam . 2.8480358684358014
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . 2.7213387683753076
and to see dear Wickham too ! 8.11130830789687
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so . 2.2122162910704493
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 1.53174046370208
They followed her into the dining parlour . 6.812920690579612
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! 2.4244620170823286
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 1.4497406703726319
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 2.1017480113324885
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> . 3.593813663804627
They were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other . 1.53174046370208
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . 1.778279410038923
But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . 2.7213387683753076
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means <UNK> or <UNK> , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . 1.5199110829529336
Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very <UNK> said , " What is the matter mamma ? 2.2122162910704493
" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet ' s manor . 1.632172128563275
Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . 1.93069772888325
<UNK> donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any <UNK> concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States . 2.2758459260747883
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the <UNK> old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . 1.425102670302998
After a short silence , the lady first spoke . 5.179474679231212
I always had a value for him . 6.812920690579612
The Foundation ' s principal office is located at <UNK> Dr . S . 3.593813663804627
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . 4.641588833612778
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream . 1.3830728955554412
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 2.9935772947204895
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . 3.359818286283782
Charles , when you <UNK> your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 1.5199110829529336
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . 2.51188643150958
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . 3.8746751204561316
They will take care not to <UNK> their income . 5.179474679231212
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all <UNK> , was still <UNK> <UNK> . 2.2122162910704493
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . 1.93069772888325
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it . 2.2758459260747883
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . " " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . 2.0535250264571463
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . " And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr . Collins thus addressed her , " When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from <UNK> you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . " " <UNK> , Mr . Collins , " cried Elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly . 1.164729742018898
no . I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . " " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may <UNK> our different opinions . " " No I cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . " " The present always <UNK> you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt . 1.2589254117941673
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch street , for the town of in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the coachman ' s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs . 1.338388753173757
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . 1.5848931924611136
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ' s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family . 1.778279410038923
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 2.8480358684358014
In a <UNK> voice Mrs . 10.000000000000002
Forster and me are such friends ! and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? 1.6496480740980204
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . 1.7534865500829584
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may <UNK> to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund . 2.2758459260747883
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party . 3.8746751204561316
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . 1.557068404753731
Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a <UNK> season , made her feel that the <UNK> , <UNK> , most thread bare <UNK> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <UNK> . 1.295267744355328
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 2.0092330025650473
Why must she be <UNK> about the country , because her sister had a cold ? 3.1622776601683795
Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it . 1.8329807108324359
. 100.00000000000004
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention . 2.154434690031884
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . 3.1622776601683795
But no such recollection <UNK> her . 8.11130830789687
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not <UNK> me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . 1.4174741629268053
She was busily <UNK> through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . 1.778279410038923
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <UNK> , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 1.4030037231905736
I had hoped that our sentiments <UNK> in every particular , but I must so far <UNK> from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . " " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . 1.3433993325989002
Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night <UNK> and <UNK> gown , and give as much trouble as I can , or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty <UNK> away . " " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " " You go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds ! 1.242623671911505
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable amount . 1.5085907086001784
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had . 1.615598098439874
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 2.2122162910704493
Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces . 2.51188643150958
I think she will be pleased with the <UNK> . " Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs . 1.93069772888325
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . 1.242623671911505
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 2.2758459260747883
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them . 3.8746751204561316
" You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason . 2.7213387683753076
She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . 1.9684194472866121
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . 10.000000000000002
In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <UNK> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 1.333521432163324
. 100.00000000000004
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . 2.9935772947204895
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 4.641588833612778
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . " CHAPTER V . 2.7213387683753076
I quite detest the man . " CHAPTER IV . 5.179474679231212
But , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 2.610157215682537
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at Longbourn . 2.2758459260747883
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . 3.1622776601683795
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the <UNK> girls in the country . 1.6496480740980204
" Lizzy , you must not do so . 5.878016072274914
They are all for what they can get . 5.878016072274914
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <UNK> satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 1.7534865500829584
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle . 2.9935772947204895
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 2.9935772947204895
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two . 1.93069772888325
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . 3.8746751204561316
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . " Her father lifted up his eyes . 2.51188643150958
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . " He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very <UNK> thing , and called out to her , " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr . Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain . 1.1020317142808502
" It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . 1.93069772888325
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . 2.51188643150958
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . 1.8632463119315603
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 1.8632463119315603
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 2.51188643150958
It was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch street by noon . 2.2122162910704493
I am so pleased so happy . 8.11130830789687
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . 5.878016072274914
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely <UNK> ! 5.179474679231212
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 4.216965034285822
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 2.0535250264571463
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 3.359818286283782
But I confess they would have no charms for me . 4.641588833612778
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 2.8480358684358014
As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it <UNK> and lovely as ever . 1.4873521072935114
Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section , " Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation . " You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who <UNK> you in writing or by <UNK> <UNK> within days of receipt that s he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg tm License . 1.319720393061375
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? " " Oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all . 1.9684194472866121
But I must write no more . 8.11130830789687
I wish I could see her . 8.11130830789687
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . 1.2775649214671148
His reception however was of the most flattering kind . 5.179474679231212
But we are all liable to error . 6.812920690579612
The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs . 5.179474679231212
And now here ' s Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 1.6876124757881477
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 1.632172128563275
The express was sent off directly . 8.11130830789687
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 3.8746751204561316
The <UNK> was <UNK> to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so <UNK> a <UNK> . 2.7213387683753076
After a slight <UNK> for good news , the letter was read aloud . 3.593813663804627
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . 4.641588833612778
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . 2.7213387683753076
But do not imagine that he is always here so often . 4.216965034285822
I think I have heard you say that you know them . " " I know them a little . 2.610157215682537
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 5.179474679231212
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 6.812920690579612
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . 2.610157215682537
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s . 4.216965034285822
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . 1.6876124757881477
Bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at <UNK> , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to <UNK> you when your father is dead . I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . 1.1733955704930705
Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 3.1622776601683795
Gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . 1.778279410038923
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . 1.9684194472866121
Philips ' s manners and politeness . 8.11130830789687
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . 2.7213387683753076
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <UNK> . 3.593813663804627
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . 1.3894954943731377
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . 4.641588833612778
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
I can recal nothing worse . 10.000000000000002
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . 1.7534865500829584
To no creature had it been revealed , where <UNK> was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 1.4977474763452014
<UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her . 1.5441135899948315
My dear Charles , what do you mean ? " " Yes , all of them , I think . 2.610157215682537
I shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will <UNK> and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " Elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 1.180164226522293
" Good gracious ! 17.78279410038923
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . " " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger . 1.41011239906908

F . . <UNK> You agree to <UNK> and hold the Foundation , the trademark owner , any <UNK> or <UNK> of the Foundation , anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement , and any volunteers associated with the <UNK> , <UNK> and distribution of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works , <UNK> from all liability , costs and expenses , including legal fees , that arise directly or <UNK> from any of the following which you do or cause to occur a distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg tm work , <UNK> alteration , <UNK> , or additions or <UNK> to any Project Gutenberg tm work , and c any <UNK> you cause . 1.1987818459583777
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . 2.0535250264571463
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . 1.41011239906908
Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane ' s ? 2.7213387683753076
It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 2.154434690031884
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . 2.2122162910704493
<UNK> the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it cannot be long . " He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . 1.3768571648527583
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
It would be such a <UNK> scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . 2.610157215682537
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . 2.7213387683753076
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 1.2260144114527525
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family . 2.346228848142263
You do not look well . 10.000000000000002
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 2.9935772947204895
Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 3.359818286283782
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! 3.593813663804627
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . 5.179474679231212
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 2.2758459260747883
Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . 5.179474679231212
or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " " My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . 1.7301957388458942
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . 2.51188643150958
" I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . 1.93069772888325
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 3.593813663804627
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much <UNK> ; but when Mrs . 1.338388753173757
But when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ' s <UNK> all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 1.53174046370208
<UNK> , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer . 1.615598098439874
Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day . 1.6681005372000588
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . " " That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever heard you utter . 1.3708385261355818
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 2.1017480113324885
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . 1.632172128563275
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before . 1.5085907086001784
Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 2.9935772947204895
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . 3.1622776601683795
He has the promise of an <UNK> in General ' s regiment , now quartered in the North . 2.7213387683753076
He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would <UNK> more birds on the first of <UNK> , than any body else in the country . 1.8957356524063758
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . 1.778279410038923
" I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 1.557068404753731
Not these two or three years perhaps . " " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can . 2.1017480113324885
Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a <UNK> chaise . " " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
No , no I feel he may defy us there . 4.641588833612778
There was another reason too for her opposition . 5.878016072274914
I will put on my things in a moment . 5.179474679231212
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 5.179474679231212
Poor Charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . 1.632172128563275
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in <UNK> it after this explanation . " Mr . Darcy , who was <UNK> against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . 1.4330125702369627
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 2.8480358684358014
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! 2.9935772947204895
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge . 1.8329807108324359
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 1.7082763938087104
A few weeks , he believed . 8.11130830789687
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . 3.1622776601683795
Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477
Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . " After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! 1.4174741629268053
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 2.346228848142263
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . 2.8480358684358014
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it . 3.1622776601683795
His belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 1.632172128563275
He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these <UNK> had arisen his principal <UNK> . 2.610157215682537
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 1.6681005372000588
They may be <UNK> and printed and given away you may do <UNK> <UNK> with public domain eBooks . 2.7213387683753076
" You forget that I have made no answer . 5.179474679231212
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane one does not often see any body better looking . 2.1017480113324885
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . 2.154434690031884
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . 2.4244620170823286
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 1.3768571648527583
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs . 4.641588833612778
They then went away . 12.915496650148839
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . 1.93069772888325
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child . 6.812920690579612
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I <UNK> believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . 1.4174741629268053
Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . 2.346228848142263
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 1.4585940117250362
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . 1.8047217668271702
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . 1.5199110829529336
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette . 3.8746751204561316
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s <UNK> name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father ' s estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think . 1.2589254117941673
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . 1.7301957388458942
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 1.7301957388458942
" She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . " Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea . 1.28792362543363
Elizabeth was <UNK> enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 2.4244620170823286
There was also a postscript to this effect . 5.878016072274914
How well it <UNK> . 12.915496650148839
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . 2.2122162910704493
" How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . You think it a faithful <UNK> undoubtedly . " " I must not decide on my own performance . " He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . 1.365007806546014
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . 3.1622776601683795
Bennet was <UNK> in her acknowledgments . 8.11130830789687
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W . 2.346228848142263
The other is Miss De Bourgh . 8.11130830789687
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 3.1622776601683795
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . 3.1622776601683795
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 1.353876180022544
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . 2.346228848142263
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " " You may as well call it impertinence at once . 1.778279410038923
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s . 2.9935772947204895
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 2.2758459260747883
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began . 1.53174046370208
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 2.1017480113324885
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . 2.8480358684358014
is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must <UNK> us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . " Then shewing her purchases " <UNK> here , I have bought this bonnet . 1.4585940117250362
Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . 1.8957356524063758
Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s sufferings . 2.0092330025650473
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 1.7082763938087104
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater <UNK> concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being <UNK> by <UNK> , <UNK> inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . 1.632172128563275
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . 5.878016072274914
only think ! 26.82695795279726
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to <UNK> her confidence in it . 1.8632463119315603
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 2.2758459260747883
It was first broken by Mrs . 8.11130830789687
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her <UNK> , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . 1.5441135899948315
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? " Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . 1.778279410038923
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 3.359818286283782
Philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly <UNK> the invitation . 3.593813663804627
Poor Lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 3.8746751204561316
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ? 2.154434690031884
Gardiner ' s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are <UNK> against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 1.3768571648527583
Mr . Collins made his declaration in form . 5.878016072274914
Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . 1.615598098439874
He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 1.7301957388458942
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . 1.9684194472866121
Lizzy <UNK> she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . " " And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems an hopeless business . " " <UNK> to Lizzy about it yourself . 1.5199110829529336
And she was only sixteen last June . 6.812920690579612
Their manners are not equal to his . " " Certainly not ; at first . 3.1622776601683795
My feelings will not be repressed . 8.11130830789687
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . " " To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 1.5706464294715548
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <UNK> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . 1.1874815363065987
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . 1.365007806546014
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with <UNK> civility , " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the shire militia removed from Meryton ? 1.6681005372000588
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . 1.2589254117941673
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . 4.641588833612778
" Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy . 3.1622776601683795
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . 3.593813663804627
She often tried to provoke Darcy into <UNK> her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . 2.1017480113324885
Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . Elizabeth was in <UNK> . 2.0092330025650473
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 3.359818286283782
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia . 2.4244620170823286
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . 2.610157215682537
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 2.7213387683753076
He is perfectly amiable . 12.915496650148839
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 1.3593563908785256
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to <UNK> ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . 1.9684194472866121
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 1.8957356524063758
I shall now know how to act . 6.812920690579612
Any other inconsistencies with modern <UNK> have been left as printed . 4.216965034285822
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . 3.1622776601683795
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . 1.9684194472866121
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " With such kind of <UNK> of their parties and good <UNK> , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . 1.4773776525985112
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 1.8957356524063758
Long . 46.415888336127786
With them he is remarkably agreeable . " " I do not believe a word of it , my dear . 2.51188643150958
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa . 3.593813663804627
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . 1.4773776525985112
The next was in these words . 8.11130830789687
My mind was more agreeably engaged . 8.11130830789687
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . 2.4244620170823286
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . " " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request . 2.0092330025650473
Jane was not happy . 12.915496650148839
And is it really true ? 10.000000000000002
" Let us sit down . 10.000000000000002
This room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . 2.346228848142263
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 2.0535250264571463
But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . 4.216965034285822
But of course she did not mention my name to you . " " Yes , she did . " " And what did she say ? " " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well . 1.5706464294715548
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his <UNK> to myself . 1.8957356524063758
We must not all expect Jane ' s good fortune . " " True , " said Mr . Bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may <UNK> you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . " Mr . Wickham ' s society was of material service in <UNK> the gloom , which the late <UNK> occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family . 1.302994338575022
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some <UNK> neighbour , who could not be enough <UNK> , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 1.4677992676220695
I do not know who is good enough for him . " Mr . and Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
No , no , you shall not deceive me . 5.179474679231212
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . 2.8480358684358014
Oh , brother , how kind you are ! 5.878016072274914
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . " Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . 1.5998587196060583
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well . 2.8480358684358014
Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it . 2.8480358684358014
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . 2.1017480113324885
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 2.4244620170823286
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 1.6681005372000588
" I am , dear Sir , c . 5.878016072274914
Jane <UNK> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour . 1.4773776525985112
His revenge would have been complete indeed . 6.812920690579612
" Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss Bingley ; " and pray what is the result ? " " I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect . 1.6496480740980204
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her <UNK> intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring . 1.4585940117250362
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . 1.8329807108324359
In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . 2.0535250264571463
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us . 3.8746751204561316
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . 1.4497406703726319
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild <UNK> of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . 1.6496480740980204
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ; but his <UNK> about the whole Pemberley family are endless . 1.93069772888325
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . 1.8047217668271702
I appeal to Mr . Darcy but let me not interrupt you , Sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the <UNK> converse of that young lady , whose <UNK> eyes are also <UNK> me . " The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 1.2843862635897427
Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . 1.4412195967188537
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the <UNK> property of some one or other of their daughters . 1.5199110829529336
Do not distress me by the idea . 6.812920690579612
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . 2.8480358684358014
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission . 2.154434690031884
One seems so <UNK> without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth . 2.1017480113324885
Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation . 1.615598098439874
Lydia <UNK> as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very <UNK> solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips <UNK> of turning away <UNK> , and if he does , Colonel Forster will <UNK> him . 1.4773776525985112
But he is an ugly fellow ! 8.11130830789687
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . 1.9684194472866121
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some <UNK> , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings . 1.5998587196060583
Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . 2.7213387683753076
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? 4.641588833612778
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ' s permission for this address . 1.778279410038923
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 3.8746751204561316
I am not to be <UNK> into anything so wholly unreasonable . 4.216965034285822
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 1.615598098439874
Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 4.216965034285822
She will make him a very proper wife . " Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the <UNK> , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly <UNK> whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way . 1.4030037231905736
Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to <UNK> . 1.7301957388458942
She answered him with cold civility . 8.11130830789687
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved . 8.11130830789687
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <UNK> of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James ' s , with very decent composure . 1.615598098439874
To the civil enquiries which then <UNK> in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer . 1.7301957388458942
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia ' s leaving home . 2.0535250264571463
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . 2.154434690031884
I rather wonder now at your knowing any . " " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " I never saw such a woman . 1.7301957388458942
But enough of this . 12.915496650148839
Oh , sister ! 17.78279410038923
Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . 5.878016072274914
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . 2.7213387683753076
" Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . 5.878016072274914
If I could but see you as happy ! 5.878016072274914
She will be taken good care of . 6.812920690579612
" I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she . 3.1622776601683795
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 1.2505106035854068
I thought I should have broke my heart . " " I am sure I shall break mine , " said Lydia . 2.346228848142263
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . 3.8746751204561316
" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But now we may be silent . " " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " Sometimes . 1.4873521072935114
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . 3.1622776601683795
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 8.11130830789687
how I laughed ! 17.78279410038923
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , <UNK> my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " " It is well . 1.632172128563275
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My <UNK> were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte . 1.396135390856794
" Good Heaven ! 17.78279410038923
Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . 1.4497406703726319
I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you but I always mend my own . " " How can you contrive to write so even ? " He was silent . 1.8632463119315603
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . 1.2843862635897427
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
. <UNK> . The copyright laws of the place where you are located also <UNK> what you can do with this work . 2.346228848142263
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . 3.8746751204561316
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . 2.0535250264571463
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
This was very amiable , but Charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . 1.5848931924611136
Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! 2.51188643150958
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . " " Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . 1.4677992676220695
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 1.9684194472866121
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ' s performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste . 2.51188643150958
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . 2.4244620170823286
Georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . 1.557068404753731
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . 2.0535250264571463
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . 3.1622776601683795
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " Elizabeth could not but look surprised . 1.615598098439874
There is but such a <UNK> of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been <UNK> about pretty much . 1.8957356524063758
She blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who <UNK> their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . 2.2758459260747883
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . 3.1622776601683795
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> . 1.295267744355328
She was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . 1.4873521072935114
CHAPTER IX . 26.82695795279726
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 2.0092330025650473
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 2.346228848142263
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever . 4.216965034285822
Good Heaven ! 26.82695795279726
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 1.6681005372000588
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 1.7534865500829584
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . " " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . " " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . 1.3768571648527583
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . 3.359818286283782
There was no want of discourse . 8.11130830789687
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . " Miss Bennet eagerly <UNK> all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . 1.6876124757881477
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . 1.41011239906908
The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away . 3.359818286283782
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 2.0092330025650473
<UNK> such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 2.610157215682537
Most earnestly did she <UNK> to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . 2.346228848142263
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . 3.1622776601683795
He heard her with astonishment . 10.000000000000002
Her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . 1.9684194472866121
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <UNK> of my son in law . 1.8047217668271702
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . 2.610157215682537
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 1.1635618505359069
CHAPTER <UNK> . 26.82695795279726
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . 5.179474679231212
<UNK> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 2.154434690031884
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . 2.0092330025650473
Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a <UNK> to buy clothes for his daughter . 2.346228848142263
You have delighted us long enough . 8.11130830789687
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . 1.632172128563275
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1.7534865500829584
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . 2.7213387683753076
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . 1.557068404753731
He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be <UNK> . 2.8480358684358014
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last <UNK> , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were <UNK> answered . 1.778279410038923
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . 3.359818286283782
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though <UNK> with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 1.365007806546014
He was very fond of them . " This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham ' s being among them . 2.4244620170823286
<UNK> it , Kitty ? " Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . 3.1622776601683795
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . 2.154434690031884
Bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . 5.878016072274914
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does . 6.812920690579612
Philips . The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . 3.359818286283782
Her ladyship was highly incensed . 10.000000000000002
It <UNK> me . 17.78279410038923
But with me , it is not so . 5.878016072274914
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . " Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative . 1.5199110829529336
Only look at her . 12.915496650148839
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest . 1.7082763938087104
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 3.593813663804627
" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she . 3.1622776601683795
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . 3.1622776601683795
But still he would be her husband . Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . 1.4773776525985112
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . 4.216965034285822
<UNK> pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . 2.4244620170823286
<UNK> such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not <UNK> the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . 1.41011239906908
Those who do not complain are never pitied . " Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or <UNK> her would only increase the irritation . 1.8047217668271702
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and <UNK> forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . 2.2758459260747883
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 2.0535250264571463
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <UNK> at the <UNK> of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time <UNK> her natural degree of sense , since the <UNK> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be <UNK> , was likely to be <UNK> in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a <UNK> place and a camp . 1.242623671911505
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 1.5199110829529336
She blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . 2.1017480113324885
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 2.8480358684358014
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . 3.593813663804627
The first half hour was spent in <UNK> up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door . 1.5848931924611136
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 2.154434690031884
But pride where there is a real <UNK> of mind , pride will be always under good <UNK> . " Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . 2.0535250264571463
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . 3.359818286283782
But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! 2.0535250264571463
Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . " " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . " " I believe , Ma ' am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . " " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . 1.2710617996147449
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> . 1.778279410038923
But make a virtue of it by all means . 5.179474679231212
my dear , " continued Mrs . 8.11130830789687
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 2.0535250264571463
Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . 4.641588833612778
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . 4.216965034285822
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , <UNK> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 2.154434690031884
<UNK> was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth " My dearest Lizzy , " I <UNK> myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . 1.5998587196060583
Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the <UNK> and smiles of the whole party . 1.6876124757881477
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <UNK> shewn . 1.6496480740980204
Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master . 2.8480358684358014
She was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so <UNK> ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe . 1.2679227183627855
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from <UNK> in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death <UNK> of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and <UNK> as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly <UNK> her father not to let her go . 1.3708385261355818
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . 3.593813663804627
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 2.7213387683753076
" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried Jane . 3.1622776601683795
What are you telling Miss Bennet ? 8.11130830789687
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . 1.9684194472866121
The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who <UNK> it , were familiar to them . 2.2122162910704493
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 4.641588833612778
why is not every body as happy ? " Elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . 1.8957356524063758
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . 3.1622776601683795
Mr . Wickham ' s chief object was <UNK> my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of <UNK> himself on me , was a strong inducement . 1.6876124757881477
With <UNK> tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of <UNK> that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . 1.7301957388458942
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth . 1.8047217668271702
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . " " In what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought Elizabeth . 1.8329807108324359
" I do not get on at all . 5.878016072274914
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 2.4244620170823286
Their reception at home was most kind . 6.812920690579612
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , soon collected them round the table . 1.6681005372000588
" What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut . 2.610157215682537
<UNK> may sometimes be purchased too dearly . 6.812920690579612
what is it about ? 12.915496650148839
If his own vanity , however , did not <UNK> him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . 1.7534865500829584
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so <UNK> with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and <UNK> of her own family ! 1.6496480740980204
Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for . 3.8746751204561316
All was joy and kindness . 10.000000000000002
But there was still something <UNK> behind , of which prudence <UNK> the <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked . 2.2758459260747883
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . " Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . 2.154434690031884
CHAPTER XI . 26.82695795279726
And who knows what may happen ? 8.11130830789687
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 1.8047217668271702
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 2.8480358684358014
was not a man to be trusted . 6.812920690579612
To <UNK> <UNK> or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www . gutenberg . org donate While we cannot and do not solicit <UNK> from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no <UNK> against accepting <UNK> donations from <UNK> in such states who approach us with offers to donate . 1.425102670302998
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . 1.9684194472866121
You must not suspect me . 10.000000000000002
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . 2.1017480113324885
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London . 3.359818286283782
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private <UNK> in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of <UNK> with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . 1.41011239906908
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . 2.610157215682537
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . 2.610157215682537
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . " " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . 1.6681005372000588
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . 1.6876124757881477
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . 1.557068404753731
Annesley is with her . 12.915496650148839
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . 2.610157215682537
yes I understand you perfectly . " " I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . " " That is as it happens . 1.7082763938087104
I have no pleasure in talking to <UNK> children . Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body . 2.346228848142263
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . 2.9935772947204895
" I am sorry it went off . 6.812920690579612
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much . 4.216965034285822
When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . 2.0535250264571463
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 2.610157215682537
CHAPTER XIX . 26.82695795279726
Mr . Darcy ! and so it does I <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such <UNK> , and her intreaty that she would not give into it . 2.1017480113324885
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged . 1.6876124757881477
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . But good lord ! 2.610157215682537
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid . 1.7534865500829584
" Did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ? 2.7213387683753076
So near a <UNK> to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart . 2.2758459260747883
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr . Bennet , have you no more <UNK> <UNK> in which Lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " " I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs . 1.333521432163324
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . 4.216965034285822
His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . 2.154434690031884
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy . 5.878016072274914
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . 2.346228848142263
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was <UNK> her feelings in <UNK> on Elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . 1.5998587196060583
With many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs . 1.7301957388458942
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . 2.4244620170823286
" Upon my word , " said Mrs . 5.878016072274914
I shall go distracted . " This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . 1.778279410038923
From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . 5.179474679231212
Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . 2.346228848142263
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 1.2401035305418566
While these <UNK> born notions were passing in their <UNK> , the perturbation of Elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . 2.346228848142263
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . 2.610157215682537
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they <UNK> with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy . 1.3593563908785256
what felicity ! 26.82695795279726
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 6.812920690579612
Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived . 1.7534865500829584
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . 5.878016072274914
what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . 1.615598098439874
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . 2.346228848142263
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been <UNK> by long expectations . 2.7213387683753076
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 2.154434690031884
I thought we never should have got into the coach . 4.641588833612778
Such a disappointment ! 17.78279410038923
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our <UNK> ! 1.3768571648527583
. C . The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation " the Foundation " or <UNK> , owns a <UNK> copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works . 1.9684194472866121
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good <UNK> engaged Mr . Collins ' s conversation to herself . 2.0092330025650473
Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs . 1.93069772888325
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and <UNK> them up , though as she never came without <UNK> some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or <UNK> , she seldom went away without leaving them more <UNK> than she found them . 1.4585940117250362
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . " " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 1.3768571648527583
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her . 2.1017480113324885
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . " " Good <UNK> ! " cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? How could his will be <UNK> ? Why did not you seek legal <UNK> ? " " There was just such an <UNK> in the terms of the <UNK> as to give me no hope from law . 1.3153690504363762
For , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken <UNK> , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the <UNK> reproof . 2.0535250264571463
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . " " What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? 1.7534865500829584
Pray , how violent was Mr . Bingley ' s love ? " " I never saw a more promising inclination . 2.4244620170823286
" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . 1.615598098439874
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 1.2990813969063477
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 5.179474679231212
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . 3.8746751204561316
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <UNK> <UNK> on the probability of each statement but with little success . 2.0535250264571463
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . 2.610157215682537
Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar . 1.6876124757881477
" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her . 2.8480358684358014
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . 5.878016072274914
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ' s visit . 1.615598098439874
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ' s . 2.9935772947204895

Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . " Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . 1.8329807108324359
CHAPTER XIV . 26.82695795279726
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 2.346228848142263
But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 2.4244620170823286
Society has claims on us all ; and I <UNK> myself one of those who consider intervals of <UNK> and amusement as desirable for every body . " Elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak <UNK> to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from <UNK> a <UNK> either from the <UNK> , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by <UNK> to dance . 1.1859710123376697
I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . " " You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr . Darcy . " " No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ' s connections . 1.338388753173757
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very <UNK> manner , with all the <UNK> which he supposed a regular part of the business . 1.41011239906908
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in <UNK> ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs . 1.4677992676220695
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to <UNK> as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was . 1.6496480740980204
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot . 8.11130830789687
But , alas ! 17.78279410038923
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one . 1.615598098439874
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins . 1.8957356524063758
Elizabeth silently attended her . 12.915496650148839
my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . " " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before . 1.353876180022544
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . 1.6681005372000588
It was at Sir William Lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled . 3.1622776601683795
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . 2.346228848142263
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . 1.5848931924611136
" Mrs . 26.82695795279726
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals . 2.0535250264571463
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 2.0535250264571463
" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? " Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago . 1.7534865500829584
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . 3.359818286283782
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 2.346228848142263
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 2.51188643150958
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , <UNK> had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 1.4773776525985112
I will leave him to himself . " In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . 1.632172128563275
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . 2.346228848142263
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 2.346228848142263
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to <UNK> his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be <UNK> <UNK> . 1.333521432163324
Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton . 2.51188643150958
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would <UNK> his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . 1.353876180022544
But my dear Lydia , I don ' t at all like your going such a way off . 2.7213387683753076
Their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse . 3.1622776601683795
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
They agreed that Mrs . 12.915496650148839
I am most seriously displeased . " Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . 1.93069772888325
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 1.9684194472866121
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . 2.154434690031884
but from what the report of their engagement could <UNK> , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea . 1.4030037231905736
Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . 1.7301957388458942
He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . " <UNK> ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 1.8957356524063758
<UNK> , teazing , man ! 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . " She was then proceeding to all the particulars of <UNK> , muslin , and <UNK> , and would shortly have <UNK> some very <UNK> orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted . 1.365007806546014
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the <UNK> road . 1.5848931924611136
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 1.93069772888325
I dare say the <UNK> upon Mrs . 6.812920690579612
But does not Jane <UNK> with the sister ? 5.878016072274914
Miss Darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . 4.641588833612778
A regard for the <UNK> would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . 2.2122162910704493
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 1.632172128563275
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
CHAPTER III . 26.82695795279726
In such an <UNK> my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I <UNK> upon his goodness . " " Oh ! 1.7082763938087104
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 3.1622776601683795
Hurst ' s gown " Here she was interrupted again . 4.641588833612778
Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> . 1.6876124757881477
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? 4.216965034285822
" Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . 2.610157215682537
Jenkinson , who lives with them . 8.11130830789687
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . 3.593813663804627
I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . 2.7213387683753076
I wonder who first discovered the <UNK> of poetry in driving away love ! " " I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy . 1.8632463119315603
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 2.4244620170823286
Gardiner . 46.415888336127786
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . 1.338388753173757
Gardiner . 46.415888336127786
<UNK> away the letter immediately and <UNK> a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . " " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . 1.4174741629268053
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 1.6681005372000588
And what do you think she said besides ? 5.878016072274914
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to <UNK> such pleasures . 1.632172128563275
Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . 5.179474679231212
But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . 3.1622776601683795
Bennet give up the point . 10.000000000000002
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . 3.359818286283782
Her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 2.610157215682537
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <UNK> of Mrs . 2.610157215682537
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should <UNK> an occasion of <UNK> his respect towards any body connected with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared . Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . 1.2077226551344626
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . 1.4677992676220695
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room . 1.8957356524063758
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 1.8329807108324359
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . 4.216965034285822
Such a countenance , such manners ! 8.11130830789687
Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs . 1.1874815363065987
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " I have just received your letter , and shall <UNK> this whole morning to answering it , as I <UNK> that a little writing will not <UNK> what I have to tell you . 1.6876124757881477
He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father ' s intentions . 1.3830728955554412
Make haste , make haste . 10.000000000000002
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of <UNK> , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued . 1.2915496650148839
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an <UNK> with her brother for talking such nonsense . 2.51188643150958
You alluded to something else . 10.000000000000002
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . 2.2122162910704493
Mr . Darcy <UNK> it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . 1.4330125702369627
Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . 2.7213387683753076
" You write uncommonly fast . " " You are mistaken . 4.216965034285822
I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! 2.0092330025650473
You will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . " He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit <UNK> long . 1.4497406703726319
<UNK> him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her . 1.778279410038923
CHAPTER XVII . 26.82695795279726
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 1.3768571648527583
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . 1.4330125702369627
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . 2.8480358684358014
" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your <UNK> appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . " " Oh ! 1.333521432163324
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening . 1.8957356524063758
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . " Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . 1.4174741629268053
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <UNK> them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 1.5848931924611136
Have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs . 4.641588833612778
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? 4.216965034285822
It will not do . 12.915496650148839
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 1.319720393061375
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . 1.7301957388458942
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . 3.359818286283782
" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " His misfortunes ! " repeated Darcy <UNK> ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . " " And of your <UNK> , " cried Elizabeth with energy . 1.5199110829529336
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 4.216965034285822
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . 1.632172128563275
It was unpardonable . 17.78279410038923
She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 2.1017480113324885
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . 1.324192791886045
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 2.154434690031884
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs . 2.51188643150958
And what sort of table do they keep ? 5.878016072274914
" <UNK> it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . " " Gracechurch street , Monday , <UNK> . 1.9684194472866121
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . 3.1622776601683795
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the <UNK> , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 1.3830728955554412
Bennet , alarmed . 17.78279410038923
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 2.610157215682537
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 2.1017480113324885
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family . 1.632172128563275
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . 1.9684194472866121
I do think Mrs . 12.915496650148839
it cannot be . 17.78279410038923
" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . 3.359818286283782
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . 1.4585940117250362
I guessed as much . " And though he exclaimed at the <UNK> , she found that it had been pretty much the case . 2.2122162910704493
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 2.610157215682537
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater <UNK> than first <UNK> often boast ; and so <UNK> did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were <UNK> to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 1.2742749857031337
But think no more of the letter . 6.812920690579612
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . 1.7301957388458942
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . 2.0535250264571463
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . 1.8632463119315603
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . 4.641588833612778
no it is not for me to be driven away by Mr . Darcy . 3.359818286283782
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? " " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . 1.3485595530525598
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . Bingley was <UNK> to Darcy by the easiness , openness , <UNK> of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . 1.4497406703726319
Society , I own , is necessary to me . 5.179474679231212
So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . 2.610157215682537
He bore it however with admirable calmness . 6.812920690579612
And when you have given your ball , " she added , " I shall insist on their giving one also . 2.4244620170823286
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 2.1017480113324885
Such were the gentle <UNK> of Mrs . 6.812920690579612
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else ! 2.9935772947204895
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . 2.4244620170823286
But Georgiana would not join her . 8.11130830789687
To know that her daughter would be married was enough . 4.641588833612778
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " Their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . 1.2809343786525484
END OF VOL . 17.78279410038923
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it . 3.359818286283782
He drew a chair near her . 8.11130830789687
" When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! I who knew what he was . 1.93069772888325
" For my own part , " she <UNK> , " I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . 2.2758459260747883
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 2.8480358684358014
We seem to have been designed for each other . " Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she <UNK> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . 1.615598098439874
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 2.610157215682537
Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual <UNK> ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the <UNK> of his thoughts . 1.41011239906908
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were <UNK> in her favour . 1.4174741629268053
My temper I dare not vouch for . It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world . 2.2122162910704493
A lively imagination soon settled it all . 6.812920690579612
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 3.593813663804627
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . 1.7082763938087104
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . 2.4244620170823286
" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party . 1.9684194472866121
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage . 3.593813663804627
" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . 2.51188643150958
There is nothing else to be done . 6.812920690579612
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . 1.778279410038923
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object . 3.593813663804627
" I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . 2.346228848142263
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister . 5.179474679231212
" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . 3.359818286283782
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them . 3.593813663804627
<UNK> to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . 4.641588833612778
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . " It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first . 1.5706464294715548
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character . 2.0535250264571463
But I know the foundation is unjust . 6.812920690579612
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford . 6.812920690579612
Jenkinson to make up her party . 8.11130830789687
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs . 2.2758459260747883
<UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . 1.4585940117250362
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . 1.53174046370208
His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry <UNK> , his wife may teach him . 1.93069772888325
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . 3.1622776601683795
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 4.216965034285822
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 1.6681005372000588
Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time . 3.8746751204561316
Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go . 2.0092330025650473
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . 3.8746751204561316
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . " " This is not to be borne . 2.4244620170823286
no , no , this is not likely . 5.878016072274914
His doing so drew her notice . 8.11130830789687
All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again . 1.632172128563275
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! 3.1622776601683795
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare <UNK> to listen to . 1.7301957388458942
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 1.53174046370208
How much you must have gone through ! " Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs . 1.7534865500829584
where is your <UNK> my dear ? " But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 1.9684194472866121
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that . 1.5706464294715548
" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! 2.9935772947204895
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . 2.154434690031884
" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . 4.216965034285822
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by <UNK> a <UNK> , or covering a <UNK> . 2.2758459260747883
Does he know his real character ? " " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . 2.154434690031884
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . " " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . 1.53174046370208
But it was not to be . 8.11130830789687
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 2.610157215682537
Good gracious ! 26.82695795279726
Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley ' s <UNK> on fine eyes . 1.3830728955554412
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . " " I see no occasion for that . 1.7534865500829584
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him . 3.359818286283782
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother . 3.593813663804627
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of <UNK> should not be broken in on . 2.2758459260747883
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world . 2.4244620170823286
But it is so strange ! " " Yes that is what makes it amusing . 3.1622776601683795
my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 2.7213387683753076
Her affections had been continually <UNK> , but never without an object . 3.8746751204561316
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . 3.8746751204561316
I always said it must be so , at last . 4.641588833612778
She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . 1.7082763938087104
I could hardly keep my countenance . 8.11130830789687
His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . 1.9684194472866121
Mr . Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . 1.396135390856794
You are lucky in having such a master . " " Yes , Sir , I know I am . 2.610157215682537
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . " " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister . 1.365007806546014
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . 1.7301957388458942
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her . 4.216965034285822
They have some of the finest woods in the country . " Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <UNK> . 2.346228848142263
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 1.2058708946926584
" Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 1.3708385261355818
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 1.93069772888325
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight . 3.1622776601683795
Mr . Bennet ' s <UNK> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! 1.3768571648527583
There can be no occasion for your going so soon . 4.641588833612778
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . " Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right . 1.8329807108324359
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . 5.179474679231212
Believe her to be deceived by all means . 5.878016072274914
Collins , did I tell you of Lady <UNK> ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? 2.9935772947204895
Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 1.8329807108324359
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by <UNK> the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . 1.53174046370208
It was then <UNK> in the following manner . 5.878016072274914
My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . 2.2758459260747883
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 2.7213387683753076
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . 3.593813663804627
Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously . " Mrs . 1.93069772888325
and it was not wholly without foundation . 6.812920690579612
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 3.359818286283782
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 5.878016072274914
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . 1.7534865500829584
It <UNK> me , I confess ; for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . 2.51188643150958
The possibility of Mr . Collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins ! 1.3153690504363762
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you . 2.9935772947204895
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . 2.9935772947204895
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 2.7213387683753076
Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c . 2.154434690031884
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . 1.365007806546014
Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . 4.216965034285822
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , glancing at her sister and Bingley , shall take place . 1.5199110829529336
Be so kind as to <UNK> for us to Miss Darcy . 4.216965034285822
But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . 2.51188643150958
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others . 1.8047217668271702
Forster . 46.415888336127786
CHAPTER XI . 26.82695795279726
That is the place to get husbands . 6.812920690579612
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 1.4977474763452014
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <UNK> . 1.6681005372000588
<UNK> them next to your great uncle the judge . 5.179474679231212
Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and <UNK> passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . 1.4412195967188537
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could . 2.7213387683753076
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . 3.1622776601683795
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " cried Elizabeth . 1.9684194472866121
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of <UNK> , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than <UNK> anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 1.4977474763452014
He was <UNK> for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have <UNK> it . 2.2122162910704493
YOU AGREE THAT YOU <UNK> NO <UNK> FOR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . F . . YOU AGREE THAT THE <UNK> , THE <UNK> <UNK> , AND ANY <UNK> <UNK> THIS <UNK> <UNK> NOT <UNK> <UNK> TO YOU FOR <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> DAMAGES <UNK> <UNK> YOU <UNK> <UNK> OF THE <UNK> OF <UNK> <UNK> . 1.333521432163324
Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an <UNK> sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she <UNK> him . 1.53174046370208
They are gone off together from Brighton . 6.812920690579612
" Do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; " that is rather singular . " " Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " <UNK> cards . 1.8632463119315603
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 2.610157215682537
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage . 1.4412195967188537
Very nonsensical to come at all ! 8.11130830789687
With the <UNK> concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 2.2122162910704493
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 1.295267744355328
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
<UNK> are settled so <UNK> . " " You <UNK> perhaps to the entail of this estate . " " Ah ! 2.4244620170823286
But if I go on , I shall <UNK> you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . 2.610157215682537
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? 5.179474679231212
" Excuse my interference . It was kindly meant . " " <UNK> girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . 1.6876124757881477
I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr . Darcy . 1.53174046370208
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate . 1.6681005372000588
Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . 2.154434690031884
Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . " " You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . 1.4330125702369627
It would have suited me in every respect . " " How should you have liked making sermons ? " " <UNK> well . 2.2758459260747883
I believe I have now told you every thing . 5.179474679231212
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 1.4497406703726319
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have <UNK> domestic felicity in so <UNK> a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . 1.2915496650148839
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <UNK> your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter . 1.5998587196060583
He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . 3.593813663804627
I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . 2.51188643150958
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern <UNK> , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . 1.213482767749144
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 2.51188643150958
Jane was distressed . 17.78279410038923

Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 1.2505106035854068
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 1.778279410038923
There can be no love in all this . 5.878016072274914
She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs . 5.878016072274914
At length the chaise arrived , the <UNK> were <UNK> on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . 2.2122162910704493
" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . 3.8746751204561316
I cannot understand it . 12.915496650148839
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . " " And I certainly never shall give it . 2.154434690031884
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago . 3.593813663804627
<UNK> nature is so prone to fall into it ! 5.179474679231212
Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . 2.4244620170823286
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <UNK> and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " Wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of accents , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right . 1.16957266874034
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . 1.53174046370208
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . 2.346228848142263
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in <UNK> <UNK> to be her husband , might then have <UNK> in its proper place . 2.0092330025650473
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ' s folly . " " Indeed you are mistaken . 2.0092330025650473
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . 3.359818286283782
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . " " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . 1.4497406703726319
It is too long ago . 10.000000000000002
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions . 1.7301957388458942
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten . 2.610157215682537
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . " The wedding took place ; the bride and <UNK> set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . 1.5085907086001784
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . 2.346228848142263
I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 2.0535250264571463
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little <UNK> by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . 1.4873521072935114
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to <UNK> the engagements that had been made for him . 1.5998587196060583
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s <UNK> her coming so far alone . 1.8957356524063758
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . 5.878016072274914
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring . 2.4244620170823286
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went <UNK> against the <UNK> ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <UNK> <UNK> , and give the praise where it was due . 1.3153690504363762
Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . 2.1017480113324885
She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 1.7534865500829584
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . " " Some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me . 1.5199110829529336
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you . 1.5706464294715548
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and <UNK> in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . 1.778279410038923
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . 4.641588833612778
Yet he is such a man ! " " Yes , yes , they must marry . 2.9935772947204895
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! 2.154434690031884
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " " Ten thousand pounds ! 2.2122162910704493
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . 1.4174741629268053
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <UNK> her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 1.5441135899948315
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 8.11130830789687
Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . 1.778279410038923
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley . 2.8480358684358014
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . 2.51188643150958
The <UNK> would be spoilt by <UNK> a fourth . 5.179474679231212
" Gracechurch street , <UNK> . 10.000000000000002
They walked on , without knowing in what direction . 5.179474679231212
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " <UNK> in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . 1.4873521072935114
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . 1.5706464294715548
I will think no more about him . " Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth . 1.5998587196060583
He <UNK> how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an <UNK> manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there . 1.93069772888325
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left <UNK> , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . 1.2175031274276027
Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself . 1.4497406703726319
Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . 1.9684194472866121
It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be <UNK> , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham . 1.6681005372000588
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and <UNK> to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head . 1.8957356524063758
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . " " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . 1.5199110829529336
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . 3.1622776601683795
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 1.4497406703726319
how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would <UNK> you about to all the balls . 2.2758459260747883
It is what every body says . 8.11130830789687
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . 2.2758459260747883
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr . <UNK> . 2.0535250264571463
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . 3.1622776601683795
If your feelings are still what they were last <UNK> , tell me so at once . 2.9935772947204895
How could I be so silly as to wish it ! 4.641588833612778
Gardiner , rendered <UNK> by Elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . 2.8480358684358014
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have <UNK> either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . 1.5706464294715548
As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . 3.1622776601683795
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it . 1.319720393061375
This match , to which you have the presumption to <UNK> , can never take place . 2.9935772947204895
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and <UNK> study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . " And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his <UNK> she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . 1.295267744355328
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent . 4.216965034285822
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . " Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less <UNK> of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too <UNK> by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . 1.2742749857031337
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . 2.1017480113324885
It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 1.7534865500829584
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . 1.53174046370208
When the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , <UNK> her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment <UNK> . 1.4585940117250362
" But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . " Elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . 1.4497406703726319
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . 2.1017480113324885
Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months . 1.557068404753731
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . 3.359818286283782
my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " Oh , lord ! 2.51188643150958
How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr . Bingley ? " " Not at all . " " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . 1.8632463119315603
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . 3.593813663804627
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self importance and humility . 1.3287913432286882
You <UNK> me for coming ? " " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you . 1.8632463119315603
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 1.7082763938087104
Philips first brought her the news . " Well , so much the better . 3.359818286283782
Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so . 1.6876124757881477
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so doubtful , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea . 1.3768571648527583
" A man who has once been refused ! 5.878016072274914
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been <UNK> by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 1.7082763938087104
" While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr . Bingley . " " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife . 1.778279410038923
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 2.4244620170823286
Perhaps he thought her too young . 8.11130830789687
She longed to see Mrs . 10.000000000000002
Elizabeth did all she could , to <UNK> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 1.2376350284724815
Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . 1.9684194472866121
In the first place , she persisted in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might be broken off . 1.4977474763452014
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a <UNK> as that , it might be of essential consequence . 1.9684194472866121
I depend on you for that . " To these high <UNK> expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the <UNK> of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . 1.2775649214671148
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . 1.93069772888325
Do not let us quarrel about the past . 5.878016072274914
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . 2.7213387683753076
But you have chosen your fault well . I really cannot laugh at it . 3.359818286283782
I never was . 17.78279410038923
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as <UNK> of derivative works , <UNK> , <UNK> and research . 2.4244620170823286
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . 1.9684194472866121
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 1.4412195967188537
" With my mother up stairs . 8.11130830789687
I am sick of them all . 8.11130830789687
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! 3.593813663804627
She is quite a little creature . 8.11130830789687
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were <UNK> of dejection . 1.6876124757881477
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? " " Nearly three weeks . " " And you saw him frequently ? " " Yes , almost every day . " " His manners are very different from his cousin ' s . " " Yes , very different . 1.4030037231905736
Though our kind uncle has done something towards <UNK> him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . 2.0092330025650473
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ' s in his regimentals . " " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> ' s library . " Mrs . 1.1954168684575872
<UNK> an only son , for many years an only child I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , my father particularly , all that was <UNK> and amiable , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and <UNK> , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . 1.295267744355328
But , really , I know not what to say . 4.641588833612778
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " I saw you look at me to day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . 1.4677992676220695
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face . 2.4244620170823286
A thousand things may arise in six months ! " The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . 2.2758459260747883
Mr . Bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is <UNK> with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . " She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . 1.324192791886045
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? " " Most willingly . " " You shall have it in few words . 1.632172128563275
Kitty and Lydia were far from <UNK> Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . 1.7301957388458942
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 5.179474679231212
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 1.4677992676220695
Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? 2.610157215682537

Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . 3.1622776601683795
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . " " She is a very fine looking woman ! 2.1017480113324885
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> . 1.93069772888325
CHAPTER VII . 26.82695795279726
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . 1.4677992676220695
Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion . 3.593813663804627
To Mr . and Mrs . 10.000000000000002
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . 1.353876180022544
" Your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . 4.216965034285822
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a <UNK> space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . 1.365007806546014
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him . 3.359818286283782
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 1.5848931924611136
I shall see her in January . 8.11130830789687
His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . 3.8746751204561316
But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . " " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . " Elizabeth made no answer . 1.3485595530525598
You know him too well to doubt the rest . 5.179474679231212
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . 3.8746751204561316
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . 5.179474679231212
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . 3.1622776601683795
I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . 1.6681005372000588
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . 1.7301957388458942
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . 1.41011239906908
And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , <UNK> every chance of <UNK> himself by marrying well ? 1.7534865500829584
<UNK> of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where . 3.8746751204561316
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . 3.359818286283782
" He is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . 1.7082763938087104
She continued in very <UNK> reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 1.7534865500829584
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
His surprise was great . 12.915496650148839
CHAPTER X . 26.82695795279726
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she <UNK> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . 1.41011239906908
came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the <UNK> , and at the <UNK> in Barnet and <UNK> , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . 1.7534865500829584
But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . " " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother . 1.7082763938087104
" Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever <UNK> , that your resentment once created was <UNK> . 1.4330125702369627
You know my sentiments . " " You are then resolved to have him ? " " I have said no such thing . 2.2758459260747883
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 1.53174046370208
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton . 2.7213387683753076
If a woman <UNK> her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . 1.6496480740980204
Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . But their father , though very <UNK> in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . 1.4585940117250362
I write without any intention of <UNK> you , or <UNK> myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the <UNK> , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . 1.396135390856794
Mr . Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . 2.2122162910704493
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . 1.4497406703726319
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most <UNK> character ! 2.4244620170823286
Bennet by admiring Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . 5.179474679231212
It was agreed to . 12.915496650148839
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . 1.8047217668271702
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it . 2.51188643150958
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas . 1.5998587196060583
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham . 5.878016072274914
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 2.0535250264571463
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her <UNK> you . " Mrs . 1.5441135899948315
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Well , how pleased I am ! 8.11130830789687
The fee is owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg tm trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation . 1.8957356524063758
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . 3.359818286283782
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . " " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be <UNK> with . 1.5706464294715548
Bennet could hardly contain herself . 10.000000000000002
has she any family ? " " She has one only daughter , the <UNK> of Rosings , and of very extensive property . " " Ah ! " cried Mrs . 1.8957356524063758
<UNK> that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . 2.51188643150958
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . " As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . 1.3153690504363762
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . 4.641588833612778
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . 2.9935772947204895
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 5.179474679231212
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough . 10.000000000000002
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . 3.593813663804627
Your ' s , c . 10.000000000000002
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some <UNK> , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . " When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister . 1.1787686347935873
Bennet one communication would , therefore , do for all . 4.641588833612778
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . 2.1017480113324885
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 2.7213387683753076
Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general <UNK> , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . 1.615598098439874
Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately . 5.878016072274914
Your ' s , c . " Mr . Darcy ' s letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last . 1.5848931924611136
It cannot last long . 12.915496650148839
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . " As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the <UNK> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . 1.425102670302998
Bennet was restored to her usual <UNK> serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the <UNK> office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton . 1.295267744355328
My feelings in every respect forbid it . 6.812920690579612
But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came . 2.4244620170823286
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , <UNK> love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means <UNK> , though it could not be exactly defined . 1.4497406703726319
Younge was of course removed from her charge . 5.878016072274914
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth . 1.93069772888325
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others . 2.9935772947204895
Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 1.2352165993694857
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 4.641588833612778
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle . 2.8480358684358014
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 1.1937766417144364
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 1.5706464294715548
" <UNK> Oh ! 17.78279410038923
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham ' s <UNK> , and complimented her on bearing it so well . 2.610157215682537
She could think only of her letter . 6.812920690579612
Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . 1.5848931924611136
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . 2.9935772947204895
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 1.2589254117941673
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance . 2.9935772947204895
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 2.7213387683753076
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a <UNK> of emotion they excited . 2.1017480113324885
The adieu is <UNK> itself . 10.000000000000002
He is so excessively handsome ! 10.000000000000002
What a fine thing for our girls ! " " How so ? 3.8746751204561316
It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . 1.8632463119315603
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . 3.593813663804627
" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . 2.1017480113324885
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over <UNK> , as I always am . 2.2122162910704493
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " CHAPTER <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
Her <UNK> are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . 1.7534865500829584
Royalty payments must be paid within days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your <UNK> tax returns . 2.2122162910704493
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <UNK> ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 2.2122162910704493
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general <UNK> to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . 1.5706464294715548
Oh , Lord ! 17.78279410038923
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . 1.6496480740980204
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! 3.1622776601683795
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , <UNK> for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ? 1.5441135899948315
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open <UNK> rejected . 2.1017480113324885
Jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all . 4.641588833612778
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not <UNK> their own , so much the better . 2.4244620170823286
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . 2.2758459260747883
Has it not been <UNK> <UNK> by yourselves ? 5.878016072274914
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . 2.51188643150958
' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! What , all five out at once ? 1.53174046370208
They would doubtless be <UNK> with the generality of female minds . 4.216965034285822
" I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could . 2.2122162910704493
" I should never have said Mrs . 6.812920690579612
Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> . 3.1622776601683795
She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . 1.9684194472866121
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged . 1.8957356524063758
It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . 3.1622776601683795
But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . 4.216965034285822
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 4.216965034285822
Bennet was quite in the <UNK> . 8.11130830789687
We acted with the best intentions . " " Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " He brought it with him for us to see . " Jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to Elizabeth . 1.5085907086001784
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . 2.9935772947204895
CHAPTER II . 26.82695795279726
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit . 1.6876124757881477
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . 5.179474679231212
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! 2.346228848142263
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <UNK> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 1.4330125702369627
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design . 1.6876124757881477
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . 4.641588833612778
CHAPTER I . 26.82695795279726
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 2.0092330025650473
" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the <UNK> that is laid on them , as nonsense ? 2.51188643150958
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before . 1.9684194472866121
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . " " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth . 1.4497406703726319
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . 1.8047217668271702
my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned . 2.9935772947204895
Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise . 5.878016072274914
<UNK> he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 2.0092330025650473
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings . 1.8957356524063758
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . 2.2758459260747883
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . 1.8957356524063758
Give me farther particulars . 12.915496650148839
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and <UNK> to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her <UNK> . 1.615598098439874
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? 1.7301957388458942
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . 5.179474679231212
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . 2.0092330025650473
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . " " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? " " Dearest Jane ! 1.5706464294715548
The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in <UNK> and <UNK> , and the evening at one of the <UNK> . 2.346228848142263
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F . 4.641588833612778
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . 1.8047217668271702
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 1.4585940117250362
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were <UNK> the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . 1.632172128563275
Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . 1.338388753173757
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . 2.2122162910704493
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . 4.216965034285822
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most . 2.9935772947204895
Indeed he has no improper pride . 8.11130830789687
I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . " Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business . 1.4977474763452014
It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> . 4.641588833612778
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another . 1.93069772888325
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford <UNK> , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 1.4497406703726319
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . 1.7301957388458942
<UNK> as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed . 1.4497406703726319
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . " Mrs . 2.8480358684358014
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . " " I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . " " Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . " " That is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . 1.3433993325989002
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <UNK> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . 1.4330125702369627
This cannot be ! engaged to Mr . Darcy ! 5.179474679231212
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . 4.641588833612778
<UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . 5.878016072274914
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information . 2.2122162910704493
It was in the <UNK> and the <UNK> , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . 2.2758459260747883
When the ladies were <UNK> for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> . 2.0092330025650473
I thought it my duty to give the <UNK> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well <UNK> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . 1.2648552168552962
yes , " said Elizabeth drily " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a <UNK> deal of care of him . " " <UNK> of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care . 1.4873521072935114
I am afraid you will be angry . " " My dearest sister , now be be serious . 2.7213387683753076
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . 3.8746751204561316
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with . 1.3485595530525598
Our poor mother is sadly grieved . 8.11130830789687
I have no such <UNK> to resent . 6.812920690579612
Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 1.5199110829529336
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . 2.51188643150958
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . 2.4244620170823286
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did . 4.641588833612778
The church ought to have been my profession I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . " " Indeed ! " " Yes the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> . 1.3708385261355818
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . 3.8746751204561316
" My aunt , " she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor street . " She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley . 1.5441135899948315
Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . 1.8329807108324359
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . " She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . 1.6681005372000588
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 1.5199110829529336
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different <UNK> ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . 2.2122162910704493
What do I not owe you ! 8.11130830789687
Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not <UNK> . 1.8957356524063758
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . 5.179474679231212
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . 1.5199110829529336
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr . Darcy ? " " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . " " I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise . 1.2451970847350329
Her mother ' s <UNK> , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . 1.4773776525985112
how I wanted you ! " " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . " " Certainly . 1.7082763938087104
What do you keep winking at me for ? 5.878016072274914
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling <UNK> on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give . 1.2451970847350329
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of inviting him . " " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . 1.5848931924611136
If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 2.2758459260747883
I know how much you dislike him . " " You know nothing of the matter . 2.9935772947204895
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . " Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . 1.8047217668271702
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 1.93069772888325
I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . " " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <UNK> of you . 1.2618568830660204
Bingley and talked of Mrs . 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
<UNK> and pride are different things , though the words are often used <UNK> . 3.359818286283782
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the <UNK> of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . 1.396135390856794
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 2.154434690031884
" And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 1.7301957388458942
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my <UNK> and care . 2.0092330025650473
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . 2.0092330025650473
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . " They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . 1.3070104796093682
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of Darcy ' s . " " Oh ! 2.4244620170823286
I do not wish to avoid the walk . 5.878016072274914
She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . 2.2122162910704493
Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . " In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . 1.5441135899948315
A little time therefore . I shall certainly try to get the better . " With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . " " My dear Jane ! " exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good . 1.3433993325989002
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 1.9684194472866121
Her colour changed , and she said no more . 5.179474679231212
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " As Mrs . 2.51188643150958
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> ! 2.51188643150958
" Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair . 3.8746751204561316
Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 2.7213387683753076
there is not a bit of fish to be got to day . 3.8746751204561316
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 3.593813663804627
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 2.4244620170823286
They <UNK> it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . 2.346228848142263
I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too . 3.593813663804627
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 1.615598098439874
Elizabeth felt Jane ' s pleasure . 8.11130830789687
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected . 6.812920690579612
Who are your uncles and <UNK> ? 8.11130830789687
Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 2.0535250264571463
so much the man of fashion ! 8.11130830789687
And for this we are to be thankful . 5.878016072274914
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . 1.8329807108324359
You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! 3.8746751204561316
<UNK> the Foundation as set forth in Section below . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . 3.1622776601683795
It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . 1.9684194472866121
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . " Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . 1.5998587196060583
These were the contents " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . 1.6681005372000588
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 1.6681005372000588
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your <UNK> . " " I should imagine not . " " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . 1.3433993325989002
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . 1.41011239906908
She <UNK> Miss <UNK> a treasure . 8.11130830789687
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . 1.53174046370208
" How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! " cried Lydia . 4.216965034285822
" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . 4.216965034285822
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <UNK> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . 2.2122162910704493
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . " " I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 1.41011239906908
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 2.1017480113324885
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . " " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose . 2.2122162910704493
Her performance on the piano forte is <UNK> . " " It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . " " All young ladies accomplished ! 1.5848931924611136
" But so we all do . 8.11130830789687
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? " " Yes ; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . 1.8047217668271702
Who should suffer but myself ? 10.000000000000002
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 1.6681005372000588
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 1.8329807108324359
Lord bless me ! 17.78279410038923
Does your charge give you much trouble ? 6.812920690579612

Allowing for the common <UNK> of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy . 1.4773776525985112
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <UNK> to his proposal . 2.2122162910704493
" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . 1.8047217668271702
Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley ' s continued absence . 2.610157215682537
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 2.154434690031884
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? 4.641588833612778
" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir . 3.8746751204561316
CHAPTER XVI . 26.82695795279726
" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . 2.2122162910704493
" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . 2.9935772947204895
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North . 1.93069772888325
His debts are to be paid , <UNK> , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased . 1.778279410038923
" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not <UNK> declare that Caroline neither <UNK> nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <UNK> the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly ! to put me on my guard ? 1.425102670302998
He replied , and was again silent . 6.812920690579612
" She is my youngest girl but one . 5.878016072274914
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . 2.2758459260747883
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . 4.641588833612778
He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? 2.154434690031884
" Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " I have , Sir . " " Very well . 2.2758459260747883
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 5.179474679231212
" Are you not diverted ? " " Oh ! 5.179474679231212

" And this is always the way with him , " she added . " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . 1.8957356524063758
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . 1.8047217668271702
if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . 1.8957356524063758
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 1.4773776525985112
My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them . 3.8746751204561316
But at length , by Elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that <UNK> which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the <UNK> . 1.2376350284724815
The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time . 2.51188643150958
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 1.8632463119315603
It <UNK> because of the efforts of <UNK> of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life . 2.610157215682537
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 1.93069772888325
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her <UNK> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . 1.5848931924611136
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a <UNK> ' s commission in the shire . 1.3485595530525598
Have not you always hated him ? " How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! 2.0535250264571463
Bennet , <UNK> that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 1.8047217668271702
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . 5.179474679231212
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . 1.8632463119315603
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 1.7082763938087104
No one but Mrs . 12.915496650148839
Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley ' s behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . 1.338388753173757
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was <UNK> against herself for being so silly ! 1.778279410038923
He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , <UNK> friend . 2.9935772947204895
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him . 1.53174046370208
I am not equal to it . 8.11130830789687
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . 2.2122162910704493
About the <UNK> , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . " Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings . 1.8632463119315603
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 3.1622776601683795
" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . " " It is no such thing . 2.4244620170823286
<UNK> more than half a day ' s journey . 5.179474679231212
Oh ! 46.415888336127786
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that <UNK> up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole <UNK> , in a variety of <UNK> and <UNK> , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 1.3593563908785256
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 1.4873521072935114
<UNK> himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all . 1.615598098439874
At length however Mrs . 12.915496650148839
And pray what sort of <UNK> do you make ? 5.179474679231212
" Of a fine , stout , <UNK> love it may . 4.216965034285822
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 2.51188643150958
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified . 3.359818286283782
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty <UNK> , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . 1.778279410038923
CHAPTER III . 26.82695795279726
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 2.4244620170823286
And when I returned home , the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time . 2.51188643150958
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 3.359818286283782
As for your Elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what <UNK> could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye <UNK> , so remarkably fine , might be copied . " At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . 1.333521432163324
<UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 2.2758459260747883
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " I never heard that it was . " " And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . 1.5199110829529336
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely . 2.1017480113324885
" Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our <UNK> way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . " Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and <UNK> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 1.3708385261355818
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . 5.179474679231212
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . 3.359818286283782

They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . 3.359818286283782
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . 1.5199110829529336
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . 2.346228848142263
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . 4.216965034285822
What relates to yourself , is as follows . 5.878016072274914
Jane now came up . 12.915496650148839
It was only said , ' <UNK> , George Wickham , <UNK> . 3.8746751204561316
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger <UNK> than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance <UNK> and <UNK> . 1.8632463119315603
Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . 3.1622776601683795
He <UNK> , and <UNK> , and makes love to us all . 3.8746751204561316
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 2.9935772947204895
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr . Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . 1.3894954943731377
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . 1.8329807108324359
But your arts and <UNK> may , in a moment of <UNK> , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . 2.0535250264571463
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you . 4.641588833612778
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy . 3.1622776601683795
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of <UNK> and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 1.6876124757881477
" Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " From the former . 1.7301957388458942
what does he say ? 12.915496650148839
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 1.7082763938087104
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . " " <UNK> ! " cried Bingley . 2.8480358684358014
A house in town ! 12.915496650148839
" Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . " He should be particularly happy at any time , c . 1.93069772888325
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . 1.615598098439874
I thank you for explaining it so fully . 5.878016072274914
I know no harm of her . " " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her <UNK> ' s death made her mistress of this fortune . " " No why should he ? 1.7301957388458942
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . 1.8047217668271702
Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! 2.0535250264571463
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . 2.51188643150958
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 2.7213387683753076
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . 3.359818286283782
Mr . Bennet protested against any description of finery . 5.179474679231212
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . 1.5706464294715548
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . 2.0535250264571463
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to <UNK> these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 1.557068404753731
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 1.7082763938087104
" What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? " " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . " " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . 1.425102670302998
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 5.878016072274914
Collins well . " " Yes , very well . 5.179474679231212
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! 2.610157215682537
You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not . 3.8746751204561316
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . 2.0092330025650473
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . " " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . " Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . 1.333521432163324
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn house . 4.216965034285822
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
It is admirable ! " Elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 2.2122162910704493
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 4.641588833612778
But I am at his disposal . 8.11130830789687
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . 2.7213387683753076
Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . 3.359818286283782
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her . 1.7534865500829584
CHAPTER XVI . 26.82695795279726
He comes down on Thursday at the <UNK> , very likely on Wednesday . 3.593813663804627
This Mrs . 26.82695795279726
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . 1.2809343786525484
Bennet could hardly comprehend it . 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the <UNK> on guard , and dressing a <UNK> and <UNK> . 1.8632463119315603
I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . 2.8480358684358014
But here , by carrying with me one <UNK> source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <UNK> . 1.8957356524063758
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <UNK> . 2.2758459260747883
" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . " " Is my father in town ? " " Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . " " And have you heard from him often ? " " We have heard only once . 1.4497406703726319
" Yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally <UNK> , without raising all this <UNK> ! 1.8329807108324359
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side . 1.338388753173757
I ought not to have said a word about it . 4.641588833612778
Nobody wants him to come . 10.000000000000002
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 2.1017480113324885
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt . 2.8480358684358014
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . 2.346228848142263
CHAPTER XV . 26.82695795279726
They were , therefore , to go . Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 1.9684194472866121
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 3.8746751204561316
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . 2.610157215682537
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . " " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . 1.5998587196060583
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 2.154434690031884
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . 3.359818286283782
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . 2.9935772947204895
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <UNK> in the gaieties which that season generally <UNK> , and that your <UNK> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall <UNK> you . " " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . " " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . " " Why will you think so ? 1.2809343786525484
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <UNK> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <UNK> , and paid off every <UNK> of civility to Elizabeth . 1.4497406703726319
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . 1.8329807108324359
Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 2.154434690031884
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 3.1622776601683795
Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 3.1622776601683795
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 2.346228848142263
Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ? 2.2758459260747883
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . 3.359818286283782
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . org Section . 4.641588833612778
I am so happy . 12.915496650148839
She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . 1.6876124757881477
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 1.2710617996147449
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . 4.216965034285822
These recollections will not do at all . 6.812920690579612
I will try again . 12.915496650148839
On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a <UNK> , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy . 1.3894954943731377
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . 6.812920690579612
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! 3.359818286283782
Mr . Darcy replied with great <UNK> , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley . 2.2758459260747883
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . 2.610157215682537
Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley <UNK> with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . 1.7301957388458942
This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better . 1.557068404753731
" Oh ! 26.82695795279726
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 1.9684194472866121
mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to day ? 3.593813663804627
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present . 2.2122162910704493
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia . 1.93069772888325
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . 4.641588833612778
The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . 1.8047217668271702
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . 1.632172128563275
He readily agreed to it . 10.000000000000002
" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . 5.179474679231212
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 2.0092330025650473
I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . 2.51188643150958
" How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! 2.1017480113324885
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all <UNK> , if she <UNK> more , and could have the advantage of a London master . 1.6496480740980204
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <UNK> <UNK> . 1.93069772888325
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . 2.346228848142263
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of <UNK> in that way . 2.9935772947204895
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 2.346228848142263
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a <UNK> which left beauty entirely behind . 1.6876124757881477
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 1.425102670302998
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 1.6496480740980204
Its banks were neither formal , nor <UNK> adorned . 5.179474679231212
If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 2.4244620170823286
They were in street . 12.915496650148839
Had Elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . 2.0092330025650473
" I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . 1.4030037231905736
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <UNK> every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were <UNK> abroad . 1.6496480740980204
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set <UNK> . 2.610157215682537
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 1.5199110829529336
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise . 1.2376350284724815
Let the other young ladies have time to <UNK> . " Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . <UNK> of the party were now applied to . 1.4677992676220695
She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . Mr . Darcy said very little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all . 1.5706464294715548
Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . 3.1622776601683795
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from <UNK> my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . 1.7301957388458942
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 1.338388753173757
Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . " " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget . 1.41011239906908
but there were two or three much <UNK> in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to <UNK> it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . 1.8047217668271702
Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon <UNK> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 1.8632463119315603
But you do not know all . 8.11130830789687
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . 2.7213387683753076
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . " " Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly . 1.8047217668271702
" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . 3.359818286283782
" A <UNK> ! " she cried . 6.812920690579612
She shared in their attendance on Mrs . 6.812920690579612
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy . 1.7082763938087104
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged . 1.9684194472866121
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ? 3.8746751204561316
" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . 2.2122162910704493
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 1.93069772888325
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to <UNK> him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <UNK> of your understanding , but <UNK> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <UNK> , and those which <UNK> the <UNK> ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the <UNK> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 1.1082630582794515
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
The particulars , I reserve till we meet . 5.878016072274914
<UNK> at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . 1.4497406703726319
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 1.557068404753731
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . 1.8632463119315603
I was uncomfortable enough . 12.915496650148839
That is all to be forgot . 8.11130830789687
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly <UNK> . 1.557068404753731
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back . 5.179474679231212
I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . 1.9684194472866121
Mr . Collins ' s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . 2.8480358684358014
I must have employment and society . 8.11130830789687
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips . 3.593813663804627
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 2.9935772947204895
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 5.179474679231212
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . 2.154434690031884
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . 2.51188643150958
and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! 6.812920690579612
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s . 2.154434690031884
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . 3.359818286283782
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 2.610157215682537
But it must not , shall not be . 5.878016072274914
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . 3.359818286283782
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her <UNK> , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . " " She had better have <UNK> at home , " cried Elizabeth ; " perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours . 1.2775649214671148
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . 1.333521432163324
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 1.615598098439874
He has not an ill natured look . 6.812920690579612
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern . 4.641588833612778
Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 2.1017480113324885
" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently . 2.8480358684358014
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable . 2.154434690031884
Why any fear of detection ? 10.000000000000002
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . 2.8480358684358014
There is nothing he would not do for her . " The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn . 1.8632463119315603
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 2.610157215682537
Mr . Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . 2.2122162910704493
Mr . Darcy was <UNK> him with <UNK> wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . 1.93069772888325
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is <UNK> the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken <UNK> , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . 1.2679227183627855
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable . 1.8329807108324359
Hurst and Miss Bingley . 12.915496650148839
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 1.41011239906908
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 1.3768571648527583
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . 1.8047217668271702
They will ruin your happiness . 10.000000000000002
If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was <UNK> done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . With respect to that other , more <UNK> <UNK> , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only <UNK> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 1.3433993325989002
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon <UNK> deliberation , you find that the misery of <UNK> his two sisters is more than <UNK> to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . " " How can you talk so ? " said Jane <UNK> smiling , " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . " " I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . " " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 1.1364636663857248
Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . " " To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart . 1.2328467394420661
I shall like it of all things . 6.812920690579612
Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . 1.8957356524063758
" Yes , Ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as <UNK> to the poor . " Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . 1.6681005372000588
Hurst was observing their game . 10.000000000000002
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 2.2122162910704493
" It may perhaps be pleasant , " replied Charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . 1.7534865500829584
" And is this all ? " cried Elizabeth . 5.179474679231212
" I hope , " added Mrs . 6.812920690579612
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . 1.5998587196060583
Bennet , who <UNK> with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be <UNK> enough . 1.615598098439874
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . 1.8632463119315603
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 1.6496480740980204
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 1.2352165993694857
It was over at last however . 8.11130830789687
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus <UNK> my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to <UNK> your authority in my behalf . 1.4873521072935114
<UNK> any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . " " Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . 1.2505106035854068
The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . 1.53174046370208
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the <UNK> of the first . 1.615598098439874
<UNK> terms will be <UNK> to the Project Gutenberg tm License for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work . 1.9684194472866121
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . 4.641588833612778
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty . 3.593813663804627
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . " " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . " To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <UNK> of an elegant female . 1.1671161911100678
GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . 1.93069772888325
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 2.51188643150958
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . 2.9935772947204895
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " My eldest sister has been in town these three months . 1.9684194472866121
They were hopeless of remedy . 10.000000000000002
Mrs . 46.415888336127786
At five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . 2.346228848142263
He placed himself by her . 10.000000000000002
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 2.51188643150958
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 1.8632463119315603
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . 1.2809343786525484
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . 1.6876124757881477
good or bad ? " " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . 1.5998587196060583
CHAPTER XIX . 26.82695795279726
He was my <UNK> , and excessively attached to me . 4.641588833612778
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! 2.8480358684358014
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 1.6876124757881477
It is Mr . Bingley I am sure . 5.878016072274914
