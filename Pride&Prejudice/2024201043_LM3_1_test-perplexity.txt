13.917778270313404
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . 29.823607053705416
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . 20.100868708044487
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <UNK> have alarmed her . 18.474848971857167
I guessed as much . " And though he exclaimed at the <UNK> , she found that it had been pretty much the case . 11.693590161862943
I fancy she was wanted about the <UNK> <UNK> . 16.62326831862018
This cannot be ! 5.981576351308315
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 11.221084191395464
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 12.44714769007608
It would be such a <UNK> scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . 14.711278873698166
Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . 14.704096094488644
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . 14.193172224884188
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . 9.868107747780448
Miss Darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it . 9.425655061258569
For God ' s sake , say no more of his partners . 13.224127816323875
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 8.481504412322511
While these <UNK> born notions were passing in their <UNK> , the perturbation of Elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . 31.666353229717462
It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ? 19.776594339795682
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . 13.756615556070212
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . 14.432914411467696
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . 10.627929426932763
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
The morrow produced no <UNK> of Mrs . 14.342487264859193
Her answer was warmly in his favour . 9.674098863283273
His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 14.891845468021215
After a slight <UNK> for good news , the letter was read aloud . 16.581020446695767
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . 10.315813476874249
How was that possible ? 6.1207720000987464
" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr . Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing after all . I consider it as one of the first <UNK> of polished societies . " " Certainly , Sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in <UNK> amongst the less polished societies of the world . Every <UNK> can dance . " Sir William only smiled . 22.0889335713724
My dear Charles , what do you mean ? " " Yes , all of them , I think . 7.254500326591583
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative . 10.713742454337577
She <UNK> Miss <UNK> a treasure . 22.839827988158074
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . 7.682050587021097
How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! 13.983389337223581
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 10.141782040911067
A most delightful place ! <UNK> Parsonage House ! 38.22432121043645
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 20.19571374755181
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . 19.153529889022177
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my <UNK> . " " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . 15.879863728440885
but no one can throw any blame on them . 11.18365786679786
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare <UNK> to listen to . 30.572447850346325
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . 15.733036560556478
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 16.915344530907067
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . 10.697467794437067
How odious I should think them ! " " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " " I am afraid you do not like your pen . 12.68069437210646
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . 21.24630488160718
Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 7.838754769576805
Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . " " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK> accordingly . " " You did ! 12.79906056431753
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . 6.652804949409569
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . 16.730360084278868
Those who do not complain are never pitied . " Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or <UNK> her would only increase the irritation . 26.438097323850183
Well ! 4.614232971270855
He begged pardon for having displeased her . 14.781740381626582
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 10.948362830796155
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 14.874937588485539
Who should suffer but myself ? 14.372561418555765
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such <UNK> as these . 17.981200032872252
Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . 10.993292677703485
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 14.469329848125076
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than <UNK> . 17.456711695035466
Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . 8.088258044260774
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 25.919290342767358
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 18.65176690147741
But there was still something <UNK> behind , of which prudence <UNK> the <UNK> . 25.385620205583997
In a few minutes , Mrs . 5.888888760404422
" He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived . 7.1570870686522285
I do not know who is good enough for him . " Mr . and Mrs . 5.2037440788743625
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? Impossible . 21.10054473230951
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost . 11.72707441138533
" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . 16.212872044801767
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely . 10.250474021446193
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . 11.169882437008006
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . 8.419345516555374
only think ! 4.7714535702078535
A clear ten thousand per annum . 33.07523115287973
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself . 8.19655798788881
Bennet ' s schemes for this day were <UNK> . 12.892302673067983
She will make him a very proper wife . " Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the <UNK> , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly <UNK> whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way . 19.936943718449804
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <UNK> silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <UNK> between them again . 27.569804286772552
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? 10.092707285052516
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . 18.959457003011565
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest <UNK> ; his <UNK> contracted , his air gloomy . 19.56684391589448
<UNK> was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth " My dearest Lizzy , " I <UNK> myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . 24.428992932741494
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its <UNK> was visiting and news . 15.414049953925153
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 17.447558447599622
It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 21.702542982049376
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 19.010958622911136
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 11.837825556293048
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . 9.08989402494146
Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her <UNK> and <UNK> , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with Miss Bennet . 18.78387959969997
She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . 15.487612287077141
Bingley was the principal <UNK> , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 10.224977262031247
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 6.809237885310514
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <UNK> . 17.60798282716248
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . 13.706520595704403
You need not . 4.611624286802154
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left <UNK> , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . 15.882841177818019
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so doubtful , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea . 18.67261993046827
I thought it my duty to give the <UNK> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well <UNK> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . 21.09327118755557
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 18.95468540124233
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . 16.027087357620953
She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 15.783485679658044
Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 9.424858555164414
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . 8.72317544392513
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company . 8.90982141738038
I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the <UNK> . 7.9852314517137
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself . 18.008565282121484
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . " This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . 16.11878758589433
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 7.597106393734947
<UNK> , of course . If you mention my name at the <UNK> , you will be attended to . " Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . 14.284520888871802
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 12.6035281598184
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . 11.059817458015832
Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 19.157815887481757
All were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the <UNK> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot . 25.940266163205475
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Good bye . 7.838307134527496
" <UNK> Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at <UNK> , if the drawing room were larger ; but <UNK> is too far off ! 19.340810727963117
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay . 9.831852575052928
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 23.074433994205908
I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims . 10.926282620347836
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . " " I should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother . 13.257103275715252
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 15.502970840726567
The officers will find women better worth their notice . 20.737229753371384
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain . 14.4652821808508
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted , is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK> their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and <UNK> them earnestly . But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference . inf
But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! 16.064210458975044
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 12.123221001340385
Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 14.46007223032084
<UNK> fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from <UNK> any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without <UNK> to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . 17.531656281741473
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . 14.670158968900155
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 16.526856189662812
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . " " But not before they went to Brighton ? " " No , I believe not . " " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? 11.159405784247971
They are my old friends . 8.809762774311581
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . 18.910608978921715
A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone . 10.563469143003696
He readily agreed to it . 6.741938974030672
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . 8.146735682928517
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . 5.196077666672371
But I am at his disposal . 6.452385282458479
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of <UNK> her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 14.413451602525486
who could have done less for her ? 7.334677592659552
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . " " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . 15.431969381374618
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . " " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? " " Dearest Jane ! 16.991492868535172
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother How is she ? 10.856947204720447
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 16.712317555030744
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . 16.009977065375733
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she <UNK> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . " Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . Wickham ' s attentions . 20.56383818113208
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at <UNK> ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . 19.105787014868017
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity . 24.27391008632029
GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . 11.054068041824314
I am the happiest creature in the world . 6.98797308940416
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . 20.39582399812656
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 13.57518811042925
Mr . Darcy <UNK> it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . 14.251669602461808
Forster . 2.9629106792784143
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 9.73944944558433
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . 7.805875210237017
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may <UNK> in the gaieties which that season generally <UNK> , and that your <UNK> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall <UNK> you . " " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . " " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . " " Why will you think so ? 19.02862558133608
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 15.715319402529826
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere . 14.335837002838275
They are all for what they can get . 7.74636759365116
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 12.153166508419117
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 13.936744577571138
The <UNK> <UNK> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have . 18.25835449225266
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . Bingley was <UNK> to Darcy by the easiness , openness , <UNK> of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . 18.597089757310933
Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master . 16.975503858999854
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . 12.277068343078787
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 11.235203202350899
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 17.841950484591983
Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , <UNK> against the <UNK> conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . 29.678894359748313
It was the last of the regiment ' s stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were <UNK> <UNK> . 12.338409486765542
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 12.447663767985658
But that is one great difference between us . 10.358648035440366
GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 21.554049876719773
Thank Heaven ! 12.007129726157435
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 18.109739789854814
Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s sufferings . 16.71397751081077
She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 20.03990166373901
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter . 14.742486380563541
My courage always <UNK> with every attempt to <UNK> me . " " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . " Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . 17.029868460929936
He drew a chair near her . 9.871598106964543
He has heartily <UNK> me now . " Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . 20.73194130234039
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on <UNK> this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 17.51251304977824
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . 9.959830223465946
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . 20.042609705708607
They contained no actual <UNK> , nor was there any <UNK> of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 32.67002130388476
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . 19.410248481421622
Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . " Mr . Bennet made no answer . 9.25053914246533
I appeal to Mr . Darcy but let me not interrupt you , Sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the <UNK> converse of that young lady , whose <UNK> eyes are also <UNK> me . " The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 23.74003822808215
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the <UNK> road . 17.36904074690738
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 14.925072059168844
Come be quick , be quick ! 11.269161177521381
To Mrs . 3.7242393302872236
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? 24.305060588504045
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 15.307903536321527
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 16.48611459160723
The <UNK> of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . 17.776027863136967
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of <UNK> little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . 22.39428150633531
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> . 15.690093164328541
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 14.979560135378447
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . 11.835679504610166
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side . 18.519538870884233
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! 22.811965971218704
I shall never forget her appearance this morning . 9.779741193919758
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . 8.713064917175732
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 19.953512806714794
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in <UNK> to the proposal before him . 10.455787814724085
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 20.978616003963502
CHAPTER <UNK> . 8.450991212750662
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . 13.386039877603755
are quite well . " " But you How are you ? " cried Elizabeth . 6.741492203008303
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . 11.502908712509559
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . 13.555877328420474
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 14.871716372143723
It <UNK> me . 7.663172638753736
<UNK> had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and <UNK> her disgust of Mr . Collins . 15.402863648765834
" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? " " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . " " La ! " replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . 10.517815400427045
I am not at all afraid of her dying . 6.604242242291866
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 13.88290646083226
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " With such kind of <UNK> of their parties and good <UNK> , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . 20.239909029652768
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . " Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented . 14.295133071807292
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . 15.694666537829937
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . 13.171138587380785
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . 11.222605907442661
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . " Mrs . 15.07809955117501
how acutely did she now feel it . 10.049182593375905
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . 9.001688454616968
We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation . 15.353721534092209
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 23.741810445075394
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 11.37013972672562
It adds even another motive . 15.456825547096807
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . 18.272345215186576
Jane was distressed . 4.53113575127722
For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . 14.235996943750628
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . 14.177471454015894
Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ' s <UNK> enough to <UNK> him from its <UNK> , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never <UNK> without him . " " So much the better . 18.16163868916665
" This fine account of him , " <UNK> her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the <UNK> <UNK> above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <UNK> than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley . 20.93407450462823
But in what <UNK> it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents . 14.75247741453822
But these things happen so often ! 15.640291165000136
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 21.72400748638314
I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a <UNK> up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 10.649028339204104
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane . 10.326159185666
Bennet <UNK> the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . 10.28462567570322
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most <UNK> character ! 13.881917225466232
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , <UNK> over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in <UNK> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 14.816224573493274
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern . 12.577487025702188
What could your ladyship propose by it ? " " At once to insist upon having such a report universally <UNK> . " " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . " " If ! 14.223625313892393
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . 11.49153493652587
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . 14.083667626887594
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son . 16.334205655510626
One came from her books , and the other from her toilette . 9.28655310181202
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some <UNK> neighbour , who could not be enough <UNK> , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 22.297781982723826
That is the place to get husbands . 8.680155240565188
I am not to be <UNK> into anything so wholly unreasonable . 15.836503544909256
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! 17.2956483535451
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . " " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . " Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . 12.092209074273354
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her <UNK> you . " Mrs . 8.034369565780228
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as , by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . 15.211400016658828
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the <UNK> of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . 13.721436158877786
I thank you for explaining it so fully . 11.001631842817545
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an <UNK> with her brother for talking such nonsense . 20.588191164173736
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . 14.760405835168836
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . " " But my father cannot . He wrote last week to hurry my return . " " Oh ! 14.870250006577347
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . 12.684197583441653
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . 6.350395714622218
The fee is owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg tm trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation . 28.536199296901064
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <UNK> . 16.39348966750157
Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 10.933977753641017
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of Darcy ' s . " " Oh ! 11.461630630908939
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 18.188766129056887
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 11.3680860014937
<UNK> was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . 13.271236113916101
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 14.191411491123441
Mary was obliged to <UNK> more with the world , but she could still <UNK> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <UNK> between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <UNK> to the change without much <UNK> . 21.337676423039817
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <UNK> <UNK> better than <UNK> ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 21.92405980309626
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . " " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be <UNK> with . 8.570584735591915
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them . 14.076257850687885
no , no , this is not likely . 3.96783997641047
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> . 17.140255075097492
CHAPTER XII . 6.932646313148128
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did . 14.27679477658915
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . 17.391607765679336
" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam . 17.70004110129736
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for <UNK> every repetition of it . 21.060006141333076
Philips ' s <UNK> was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs . 14.882550280598215
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 13.48716321310427
No , never . 3.234786323087944
They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . 10.461836491168354
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr . Bingley ? " " When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . 9.12101311938696
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company . 12.943940140157595
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 5.132348160642011
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged . 12.90112747703967
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . 10.510673730956702
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . " " Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> . 26.871672459613222
" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s <UNK> in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . 15.018318189912629
But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . 16.896296758605423
Every body is disgusted with his pride . 12.420257310413382
" Of music ! 8.509836487502794
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s <UNK> name ? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father ' s estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think . 17.689548357727375
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 8.215992285808683
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as <UNK> <UNK> as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . 16.285527302083267
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 14.713975955174218
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 12.672706521991868
how rich and how great you will be ! 9.042712274379387
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 18.79254714227368
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 14.721768366640871
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening . 11.697585801860102
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including <UNK> , online payments and credit card donations . 45.21261380723353
Mr . Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . 16.091700621782426
There is one point , on which I want your advice . 9.461561627136842
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs . 11.557396825026334
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas . 33.951326868906825
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <UNK> . 12.965857688512736
She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . 13.016323737507985
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her <UNK> to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary <UNK> to the <UNK> of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 15.773477865507733
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford <UNK> , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 21.619377768385483
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
We had better not mention it . 6.723254107635955
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings . 16.07963370276538
What could be the meaning of it ? It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know . 8.507681109343014
<UNK> , <UNK> , . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations . 32.640565883884555
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . 7.312431086039209
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 10.289466264477307
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " CHAPTER <UNK> . 19.331323830424097
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . 8.447153612943005
They are gone off together from Brighton . 13.034693329261726
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . 11.303263888199272
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . 13.578848041990483
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . 17.15025305001426
To his <UNK> engagement with Miss De Bourgh ? 24.49453873298119
CHAPTER XV . 6.932646313148128
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and Mrs . 16.34109946987624
Bennet , " to walk to <UNK> Mount this morning . 10.094038559397541
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 10.95104186710939
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it . 22.89091697074012
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 26.698495742241423
Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was . 17.588583330012494
<UNK> on Jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy ' s explanation , by <UNK> Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 16.654510749136193
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . 11.755797475520673
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . 13.481194359307462
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was . 14.086712751609769
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such <UNK> sisters , home could not be <UNK> , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake . 14.160719100409004
You will be a very happy woman . " Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 10.571086552574187
But make a virtue of it by all means . 7.293661066288894
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <UNK> at the <UNK> of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time <UNK> her natural degree of sense , since the <UNK> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be <UNK> , was likely to be <UNK> in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a <UNK> place and a camp . 31.416198669325144
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? 15.049174563949167
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a <UNK> situation , and always spending more than they ought . 19.849328247881257
that he had <UNK> his <UNK> in the first dance ! " " Oh ! 12.543404959133815
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . 11.088868203054558
That lady I suppose is your mother . " Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . 9.946352670510143
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . 16.417137344441514
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can <UNK> a woman . " " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? 13.339147466247098
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle . 10.196196149754378
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 16.10119885880705
One seems so <UNK> without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth . 10.867710950579315
Pray , how violent was Mr . Bingley ' s love ? " " I never saw a more promising inclination . 11.534690656915343
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . 17.24936193608441
<UNK> wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . 13.69526330305138
Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . 6.4564251627349
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 10.080353994285867
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> . 9.278260479658051
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . " " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth <UNK> ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy ' s steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself . " " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a <UNK> . 14.938003260096654
It became her turn to listen . 9.093400743553648
Elizabeth silently attended her . 7.439125803762784
As she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs . 11.039202555386572
Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active <UNK> , and when immediately before my father ' s death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . " " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth . 14.70589988554767
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <UNK> , by a precipitate <UNK> with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . " " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 17.83638474376065
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F . 7.882333591704103
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . " " My beauty you had early <UNK> , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . 14.005749980313391
The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy . 11.215805867826665
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 15.47620621992626
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . " " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . 15.599893132418732
My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can ' t write ; so I will <UNK> , and you write for me . 10.96771588759702
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his <UNK> . 22.463678091306942
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . " " Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . 15.095758620587839
She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent . 9.852873672763554
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 16.92027178248373
Adieu to disappointment and <UNK> . 12.380431406743815
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 16.124307853010365
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 10.929499145128029
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 13.461131800070483
In spite of her deeply <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger . 19.047326553641266
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the <UNK> curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two <UNK> of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . The envelope itself was likewise full . <UNK> her way along the lane , she then began it . 26.570000187405142
We seem to have been designed for each other . " Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she <UNK> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . 20.25651636504791
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair . 16.439554867638375
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 18.62605073580148
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . 15.049194972633433
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much . 7.865543571650024
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . 6.723238926538886
" E . 3.0104580072345435
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour . 17.37348292804729
" I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . 9.385852711741249
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 7.073753219554549
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . 15.11487897375466
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . 12.078785888601224
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> . 11.809163313823007
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . 13.108644471635927
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? " " Most willingly . " " You shall have it in few words . 14.893993602700254
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . 15.650275580161068
" I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the <UNK> and public places . 17.644277591355827
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . 11.842809840737823
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at . 8.12909296260254
" Yet why did he come ? " She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . 11.906133256860297
Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 20.277640546377786
Collins so before you came . 5.508285315190439
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to <UNK> these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 16.472947353520894
It was to be such a secret ! " " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject . 7.609350658471756
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . 19.62362008646799
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever . 13.746870617535098
Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! 13.75672729419004

Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 9.308195961230515

She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . 14.016381098511866
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 12.78445243302325
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 19.142645518252827
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! 15.47414259632157
" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <UNK> , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss <UNK> ' s . " " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . " " Oh ! 19.027836832304576
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 12.9280295924691
His debts are to be paid , <UNK> , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased . 17.093927944153222
I am very glad you liked her . 6.295125630066947
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new <UNK> . 17.107685864764157
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . 22.13821097284689
Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . 11.89639111549907
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 6.6485105677442675
The evening passed quietly , <UNK> by any thing extraordinary . 18.724535257941525
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . 11.164647197023587
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 10.810491044758038
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! 19.92664082291
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you . 10.719061323916101
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! 21.175382325083756
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . 13.132037467282263
Bennet , alarmed . 3.8378532188550967
It was all pride and <UNK> . 8.11417089455457
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 11.232144893437074
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 22.2677461087121
" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides <UNK> tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! " Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days . 23.838897248917966
Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s <UNK> , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any <UNK> of sentiment . If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error . 19.778658596354052
" Your affectionate friend , " <UNK> <UNK> . " " Oh ! 12.920529195792664
I am prodigiously proud of him . 7.218945371693931
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 12.566947587529835
But think no more of the letter . 4.889838874298342
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . 15.756267836726298
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been . 12.36677858223021
Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . 6.187617932647762
They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . 11.564247665667397
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . 13.896054871861207
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , <UNK> her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <UNK> , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . 17.490984462864795
CHAPTER XII . 6.932646313148128
I hope you have destroyed the letter . 6.736927402790987
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . 11.389591988225941
But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he <UNK> that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 13.461954321471767
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . 12.986504844255807
I only hope they may have half my good luck . 11.33492530274405
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister ' s being in town . 9.656252326254764
it is of no consequence . 4.018409603196478
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . 14.229957555032467

They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . " " <UNK> a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . 17.539055430905474
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . 9.315694860442274
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . 8.785146450831494
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <UNK> on such a research ; in which <UNK> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally <UNK> , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . 20.68606273339398
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind . 8.608556047836109
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . 8.377570937155516
Mr . Wickham ' s chief object was <UNK> my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of <UNK> himself on me , was a strong inducement . 19.961930674563956
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence . 16.439595722512408
I do not deserve it . 4.713546916810243
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 11.557328068467678
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 13.076118356107214
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . 16.59971727165116
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 18.508939651922944
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child . 14.022960160489136
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 7.066369425806246
It is too long ago . 7.754808345597565
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 12.010184801234297
Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . 14.471657680789722
Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . 15.937320752028665
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or <UNK> reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . 20.545892843220905
She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again . 10.118542719793977
But , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . 8.314584161783307
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . 11.443064125153303
Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps . 13.594464691820539
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . <UNK> staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . 20.461749192622285
You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! 15.558264328710392
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even <UNK> to suggest some herself , some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs . 24.77627695569215
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 13.117105142782082
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . " " Oh ! 12.070507108217368
But though every thing seemed <UNK> and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <UNK> ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . 18.992786278788024
But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . 18.26292419186644
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States . 19.253166943968612
What are men to <UNK> and mountains ? 18.111763536449654
I quite forgot ! 7.879291360297374
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him . 11.535639292549767
There was also a postscript to this effect . 10.54224490884795
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! 11.271988397211668
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone . 20.666191953091534
He could number the <UNK> in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <UNK> . 22.584776209176507
it cannot be . 3.028995455773131
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . 12.10177499293599
" Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . 18.942195988955802
Mr . Darcy may <UNK> himself . " " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried Elizabeth . 7.434368176381066
" I am sorry it went off . 6.615294882552602
She will not be able to help calling . " " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 15.608634228297836
I am impatient to see him . " " In point of <UNK> , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective . 11.472203902647044
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 10.501970059647347
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <UNK> . 16.641678450891114
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the <UNK> girls in the country . 16.602374751779426
She went on . 4.145805568958871
That is all settled . " " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . 9.905011035426268
Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls . 10.824842753489532
" Oh ! " said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . 7.8123421406993305
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . " Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . 22.963688193012196
The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . 10.827503598817188
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 19.466300328568046
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ? 22.345805068119056
Mr . and Mrs . 2.2607144256097547
what has she to do with it ? 4.932258077330161
my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 9.129484990853758
In Three Volumes . 13.746175663774439
Bennet ' s civilities . 5.786516938876493
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . " " Not as you represent it . 9.887554514061518
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . 14.644456044972541
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . 12.25259126812522
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . 12.803888716361518
Charlotte is an excellent <UNK> , I dare say . 12.513548389886068
As long as she <UNK> there , it is all very well . 9.390222202796245
They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply <UNK> on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . 24.909114502375438
I do not trust my own partiality . 8.471330203634308
I thought I should have died . 6.657106182344985
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . 10.53148005187361
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ? 14.17904147999129
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 19.89763167832067
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little <UNK> by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . 20.26523086620458
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <UNK> the excellent understanding , and <UNK> excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 17.122878123245115
You see on what a footing we are . 9.618710845639136
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . 17.856190877547373
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 20.52995334939492
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 21.352806195822023
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 11.079043370134968
Nothing could be more delightful ! 10.35918773824394
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . 13.552797443627531
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent <UNK> of <UNK> on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . 19.021644792829083
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " Elizabeth could not but look surprised . 16.569173019936397
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . 12.962414702746383
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 25.39797361529593
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 11.71020257691686
I was never more <UNK> ! 8.957033231438198
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so <UNK> to you . 22.302682212389268
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . 14.154252165596782
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . 15.579592750912918
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had . 11.573413927135789
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . 13.488929960931758
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . 19.140056272138928
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . 10.068386212077831
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined <UNK> ; and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . 29.50468679896245
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the <UNK> of my father ' s will , has been <UNK> acquainted with every particular of these transactions . 23.024999411095973
came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the <UNK> , and at the <UNK> in Barnet and <UNK> , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . 21.045592021898386
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 18.827540304736544
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . 9.372183031577334
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . 14.193218877864197
It was first broken by Mrs . 7.663126791284186
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth . 4.879563648400341
Nor was Darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 14.361088765103524
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 18.867042286362544
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . 24.95709042745665
But I know the foundation is unjust . 8.84916465416023
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . " " <UNK> their income ! 22.830864293807544
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 11.330641699287504
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 10.388642645684916
Bennet ' s ill humour or ill health . 12.209270095327343
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . 16.73410537000206
I will think no more about him . " Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth . 15.41341673117546
In a <UNK> voice Mrs . 11.735446905047883
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? 11.92724337091646
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . 8.508864006878339
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . 18.155075988930164
And then we were so merry all the way home ! 13.730975871191495
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . 8.572624316811524
" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt . 8.021737067428184
Bennet , who assured him with some <UNK> that they were very well able to keep a good <UNK> , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <UNK> . 13.9798616584039

" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! 11.619777401168564
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " " <UNK> do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 19.655938137412797
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation . 17.21643519456541
In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . 20.3660219302095
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not <UNK> a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . 19.99243080059712
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . 8.425571141302777
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? 7.7149459128556375
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 13.540484354997462
Miss Lucas is married and settled . 7.173172415675169
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <UNK> <UNK> necessary . 26.69290364104686
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 12.811211386126852
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . 8.338650313245097
<UNK> he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 10.715531743042739
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 16.922034604003
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . 16.27242634901665
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room . 13.715344168386254
He was angry . 4.504252517192857
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 20.634813406509803
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed . 32.489373165703064
" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of <UNK> in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ' s regard for me . 15.279576958941455
After walking several miles in a <UNK> manner , and too <UNK> to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their <UNK> , that it was time to be at home . 17.432169641336948
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 15.576784025636114
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <UNK> , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 19.904531060970946
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . 9.6316142222989
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the <UNK> of red <UNK> there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 21.222368739279137
CHAPTER XV . 6.932646313148128
Their visits to Mrs . 6.831718231253604
Does your charge give you much trouble ? 18.05025740958524
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 14.742120695632016
He is so excessively handsome ! 10.49006818154658
CHAPTER VII . 6.932646532395619
Five daughters <UNK> entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . 13.60344609056505
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 14.145902871185106
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . 12.55214930545099
She dared not even mention that gentleman . 10.855471850898816
Heaven forbid ! 12.598380546779099
She was busily <UNK> through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . 22.94694486066988
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design . 11.543694457186225
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <UNK> ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most <UNK> , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . 19.269303789936004
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 8.74048676342121
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . 14.109362333713038
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 12.623633840694744
You are a gentleman ' s daughter . 6.849704951611397
Have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs . 7.033753142227799
But she would not be secure . 5.292553784279981
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 18.085626576781074
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 16.71455445732038
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . 7.767564130940851
Hurst and Elizabeth herself . 4.343978933302223
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 16.74171970062037
" ' Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much . 8.510997036677582
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . 16.525156453097434
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a <UNK> as this . 16.390391899307843
I am perfectly satisfied . 5.8740047512401565
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . 14.931190142032792
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? " " I think she will . 10.716027982299272
I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . 9.031596399532747
" It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . 11.40692822902261
who attended to you ? 5.4139237173760835
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 12.928393012594633
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 10.156036262211352
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " There can be no doubt of that . 10.933727390067009
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . 11.976909086058033
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . 20.031490421332407
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . 27.17025573668945
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse . 20.62271425059284
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! 13.107785662057882
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " Oh ! " cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted . 15.12286014812669
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer . 17.911914290326514
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . 11.789176582257921
Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 12.31078243887633
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <UNK> . 19.537204209822377
Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . " CHAPTER XIII . 15.53952344737742
He still loves me , and we are engaged . " Jane looked at her <UNK> . 12.308334756246088
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his <UNK> , all honoured with the <UNK> of <UNK> , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . 18.300923108555303
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 13.401798317136503
Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? 10.273245994434063
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will <UNK> excite . 23.726130919570192
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it . 8.726894088961842
They followed her into the dining parlour . 11.128632770259774
Hill and the two <UNK> . 9.087225500084752
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . " " She is a very fine looking woman ! 8.098239024862153
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 12.499644817946738
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . 13.910834350184716
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 20.810619100588912
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 10.142304314545628
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 11.155855209259443
Bennet , " that is very unlucky . " " Can I have the carriage ? " said Jane . 6.16935102725883
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . 10.262334918762107
Can I speak <UNK> ? 16.106952433260304
To <UNK> <UNK> or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www . gutenberg . org donate While we cannot and do not solicit <UNK> from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no <UNK> against accepting <UNK> donations from <UNK> in such states who approach us with offers to donate . 66.98283962883201
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <UNK> by Wickham . 15.738645215265034
She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa . 11.144934141484253
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . 11.0743918119334
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 13.009360084928797
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to morrow . " This was a sad <UNK> of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 14.071153713934628
Why must she be <UNK> about the country , because her sister had a cold ? 13.972306893753709
It would be dreadful ! 7.453449557338332
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 18.752784663506183
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 9.931540885038922
Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . " " No , no . 5.111484782156915
His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . 13.771643727597777
The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 12.238241283205316
Jane was not happy . 3.7619030841582104
It is what every body says . 8.730039327858524
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . " <UNK> as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat <UNK> , she had all the success she expected . 20.166859711110032
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 11.597946469813397
Every body declared that he was the <UNK> young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always <UNK> the appearance of his goodness . 16.72751256131457
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . 7.080479619758792
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . 11.60030051958674
The vague and unsettled suspicions which <UNK> had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 20.805845757594657
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his <UNK> one day , at Netherfield , of the <UNK> of his <UNK> , of his having an unforgiving temper . 17.88051757292842
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
There can be no love in all this . 6.79455300108928
She certainly did not hate him . 8.006203108257893
That he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . 10.375479459894498
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . 17.054100648813122
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 16.846867530714178
He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . 10.56655151980439
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! 6.401226861827863
" What will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are ! 7.980152213657671
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 8.420520809271098
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . 9.65772806713167
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage . 16.772811775773885
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 17.90793573651774
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 21.97880978039483
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . 16.70294855027469
He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? 10.885187782286764
<UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> . 16.71115476810632
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell <UNK> to mend a great <UNK> in my worked muslin gown , before they are <UNK> up . 27.65743366562136
If I could but see you as happy ! 7.507017759886754
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance . 28.586554150479675
Are the <UNK> of Pemberley to be thus <UNK> ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . 16.497462799647852
It is useless to talk of it . " It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . 12.866974551578325
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs . 7.809395749599949
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . 11.386033519776142
" Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " From the former . 13.172208268716833
You alluded to something else . 8.961436709127135
I will speak to her about it myself directly . 7.0970288358159115
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . 9.546601561227991
A few weeks , he believed . 8.405136468333053
Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . 8.166020583921277
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 6.957809311343067
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 15.002848470670092
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My <UNK> were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte . 15.083496597008853
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 14.310728883525629
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 11.685351159066206
She was very wrong in <UNK> me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 16.9759541567327
They had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister . 11.832064964383097
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . 8.22550416859909
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . 7.874000364730372
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . 16.158481207457612
" How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet ! 5.391972850172737
They <UNK> it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . 16.06925592539786
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley . 11.562754711737
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented . 15.609667615795308
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 12.657687412539138
What could be more natural than his asking you again ? 12.894436137263236
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it . 29.46895888998298
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . " " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . 14.455318976761122
They must have seen them together for ever . " " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . 15.405272082719343
I must beg to return to the house . " And she rose as she spoke . 8.069277277932295
The <UNK> letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 11.992007582256482
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 10.07780320117066
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they <UNK> with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy . 15.205306251575818
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 11.025928577151175
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 10.474816434575484
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her . 8.226255443935207
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> . 16.939708145988664
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . " " I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 11.734195220687724
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . 11.208032640815679
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 17.845872899223753
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that . 11.356845328574346
There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King . 14.762339725787408
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . 25.980024114752524
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 21.6638585351659
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . " " This is not to be borne . 9.892296995569351

Lady Catherine was <UNK> proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her . 16.53640245800012
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 9.197829425994133
" You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age . " " I am not one and twenty . " When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . 13.033737112309577
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was <UNK> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . 17.558576509001988
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my <UNK> and care . 16.461035119706313
I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 12.128181232411615
' Ah ! 6.630591056644997
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 16.773159680967574
She will be taken good care of . 7.348629705451217
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was <UNK> by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . 9.161007582740034
It would have suited me in every respect . " " How should you have liked making sermons ? " " <UNK> well . 16.353744383226374
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 11.558470165101362
You refuse to <UNK> the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . 12.686148608900032
Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 13.078671744184446
Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 15.55335513843822
Without a governess you must have been neglected . " " <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . 15.621367835809165
" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly . 8.660603875175314
You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . 12.437672552867623
That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <UNK> in town , as Mr . Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . 16.503523650233678
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 12.603460205033517
Egerton , Military Library , Whitehall . 17.904208165752376
Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a <UNK> air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . 27.96132528787507
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . 9.526452247990512
He had never had the slightest suspicion . 9.015414652670255
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . 14.680323729979378
" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? 11.453446392874028
Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . 16.02512001198253
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 13.757175059267421
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . 30.167344079412647
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 10.584484482001438
" Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say . 6.129078766488836
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 8.762502172103952
When is your turn to come ? 8.770437854059557
Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 9.137985077124497
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the <UNK> property of some one or other of their daughters . 19.54929366650858
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 12.722160250980089
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . 10.286779591221153
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what <UNK> his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 14.099069744545849
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not . 18.544813089058067
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 15.188200292915447
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . 10.409335959410583
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 18.023265162310036
Bennet was <UNK> engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <UNK> them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather <UNK> than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . 19.534086234972026
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 16.50186139239285
" The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them . 6.6372324963328975
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one <UNK> of perfect <UNK> in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his <UNK> that her manners were not those of the <UNK> world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . 24.996354795194634
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . 13.19544755631963
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther . 17.75062068499346
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 16.31681168040605
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . 14.875446964221329
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be <UNK> from Jane . 10.705324139285727
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! 11.397365009388542
Bennet thus began the <UNK> conversation . " Oh ! 13.515027466547368
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . 15.37447695023772
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 18.158948370363017
And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined . 13.580285426735772
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . " From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . 15.299564058217687
But so they always are . 5.308855477810399
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 13.724639743718717
Do not distress me by the idea . 7.874594512629591
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . 18.4515731937082
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 18.3407690587268
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . 16.451565867397246
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <UNK> than to herself . 13.701378633047085
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 10.045341993400978
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . 12.935864650020745
Elizabeth , after slightly <UNK> it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . 15.398172166600387
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , <UNK> had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 13.788001147993368
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . 16.66240444794831
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister . 15.023658648002705
They agreed that Mrs . 5.9986722282014675
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 8.72627521037342
The hill , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . 21.390768187181074
Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . 17.507754015955083
The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . 23.252533412173577
" Oh ! 3.580881536246356
Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 16.96099002993425
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ' s way . " Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <UNK> . 16.54203481280188
Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 12.771234580330804
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> . 20.861900969323386
Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <UNK> and <UNK> father ; and though he belonged to one of the <UNK> , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 22.068562114480027
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . 11.286713029811066
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 17.516825678636668
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . 16.46195361337208
Oh ! 3.9500692332481635
They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and <UNK> , though <UNK> families . 17.240996090456914
From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 21.781480354973148
Elizabeth did all she could , to <UNK> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 15.96367371348318
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . 13.558523127890702
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 18.984108189933238
" If they had uncles enough to <UNK> all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one <UNK> less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . 17.470005319615414
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 16.607682043985456
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . 12.727803125194535
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 10.490334964013394
" A man who has once been refused ! 14.003044254277086
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very <UNK> <UNK> for Netherfield were got by <UNK> . 24.68281611111926
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . " " My dear , you flatter me . 9.93161033232563
It will not do . 3.8760080243373074
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 19.32769253407413
I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . 12.256741591069439
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done . 13.78079618859207
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 17.421377592003328
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 10.596494426354148
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever <UNK> , and the <UNK> friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . 13.816856259363194
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 15.959776697766458
and it was not wholly without foundation . 6.931908730981086
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were <UNK> of dejection . 17.5928289679544
<UNK> always take you by surprise , and me never . 10.177530668244753
I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to <UNK> such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room . 14.599814671229392
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 11.184920362336268
The other is Miss De Bourgh . 9.25595110623076
so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to every body . That is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . " " Did Charlotte dine with you ? " " No , she would go home . 21.0429818635552
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . " " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us . 17.752630926628868
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . 16.309691258020973
are sufficiently known . 7.604277810884796
I saw them the night before last . " Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . 12.584252220736309
It was in the <UNK> and the <UNK> , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . 8.021152433171343
" I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five <UNK> any object . 14.970243060031748
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her . 11.243019175745692
do any thing rather than marry without affection . 12.312748804390933
I am sure my sisters must all envy me . 10.248456132632311
Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go . 8.602612066866445
" I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . 7.133386619410222
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 17.51826881147607
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small . 14.094895136732065
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 7.0184122957266135
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! 18.94162441637123
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . 4.244641357039277
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe . 10.446392168050536
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 10.009003260005743
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 17.323494240216174
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . 12.623757735810344
She was overpowered by shame and vexation . 11.460146949813792
His reception however was of the most flattering kind . 11.720473618636055
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 11.597351172410255
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . 14.280378106053533
I dearly love a laugh . " " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . 8.673804200342708
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . 7.645718838183915
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 19.848328676024632
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one . 16.83019662795541
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball . 15.420051562373914
I can recal nothing worse . 10.829948628691032
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . " " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . 13.533390854225287
Could there be finer symptoms ? 20.581362496351993
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ? 12.993168454413167
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly <UNK> , she seated herself . 20.409287147649916
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . 13.32144274236461
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before . 19.93692290348216
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 13.872055110447373
There was no help for it however . 6.653036297834603
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? " " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . " " Oh ! 11.202549907899693
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . 16.988466263388908
I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . 19.60270758310213
How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . 11.17435794986317
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 7.378767199328524
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B . 16.721802916649757
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall I call it ? 14.158602782581502
Their fortune on both sides is splendid . 18.79680303234042
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 10.855090704293096
Mrs . 2.0709290154118682
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! 13.213649355840442
The <UNK> or <UNK> of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining <UNK> . 34.783123715405715
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 10.57339437239599
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . 9.14299188590514
Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 11.45202509870089
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . 15.724312312302638
It is impossible for me to be impartial . 7.532829686275496
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private <UNK> in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of <UNK> with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . 18.521400853783252
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . 10.658056110665722
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two <UNK> with Jane again , and the two <UNK> with Lizzy , and the <UNK> " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! 15.32951218600347
" Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? 5.080137433416879
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . 13.158030686373273
CHAPTER VII . 6.932646532395619
She saw with the <UNK> eye of fancy , the <UNK> of that gay bathing place covered with officers . 26.517651082988316
" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . 5.607083419630304
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . 8.744144986226228
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild <UNK> , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character . 21.18692400800511
I knew that Mr . Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . 6.389418257475086
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . " " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . " To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <UNK> of an elegant female . 28.353667111984077
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the <UNK> , and try if any thing could be made out from them . 12.41769583844523
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . 10.846587970163384
The first week of their return was soon gone . 9.694090562563224
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . 13.97817208472817
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it <UNK> , has surprised me a good deal . 14.630650608628159
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . 10.323297963002775
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to <UNK> him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <UNK> of your understanding , but <UNK> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <UNK> , and those which <UNK> the <UNK> ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the <UNK> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 22.72091439122494
<UNK> him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her . 23.559726198687425
how shall I bear so much happiness ! " She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty . 18.616054883127795
Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . 14.761039664740304
" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir . 9.59294602324833
Jenkinson , who lives with them . 7.898126867416099
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the <UNK> , and was soon out of sight . 13.824029548491012
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <UNK> , readily obeyed . 17.111927910400198
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . 14.699747428218181
You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and <UNK> all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg tm works . 32.12931124822434
CHAPTER I . 2.8380368561768754
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . 9.759893905133861
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . 13.400412565268176
You have employed your time much better . 9.763541108387793
I told Mrs . 3.5741058905488314
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . 8.120633409448027
" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . 7.71546698839935
How well it <UNK> . 9.352672734830271
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 8.700673569292643
They all <UNK> tables , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> . 52.34841573011816
A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it <UNK> from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . 18.414141604017473
Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach . 14.916150156482303
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . 10.395421720497371
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the <UNK> , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <UNK> . 16.676020423954217
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? 12.184135452870073
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 14.043532781861076
It must be an amusing study . " " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing . 17.82615455275415
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite <UNK> ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but <UNK> and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation . 18.630122405429947
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 8.984434429219643
What do you keep winking at me for ? 13.269852059703558
single , my dear , to be sure ! 5.587302755039965
Though our kind uncle has done something towards <UNK> him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . 24.0121360520549
Their first subject was the <UNK> of the Rosings party . " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . 12.834542419168093
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . 15.946596598923827
Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body . 12.947098801766085
" I expected at least that the <UNK> were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! " " La ! 13.828044218918219
Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party . 11.00173741685693
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very <UNK> to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . 9.538677550599727
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . " " I would wish not to be hasty in <UNK> any one ; but I always speak what I think . " " I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder . 11.012109970550961
" I am all astonishment . 4.137637128833981
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 16.31220839533609
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . 22.491479623783135
You are safe from me . " " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . " " And your defect is a <UNK> to hate every body . " " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . " " Do let us have a little music , " cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . " Louisa , you will not mind my <UNK> Mr . Hurst . " Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it . 15.82327243598178
