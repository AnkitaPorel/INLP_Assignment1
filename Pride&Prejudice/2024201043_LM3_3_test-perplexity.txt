Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 14.266039282840902
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 17.37005833811555
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . 16.62006112493442
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> . 17.250182616123418
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 17.642671039976754
" Mrs . 2.1452065428999276
" You have <UNK> me , in every possible method . 10.67764972742265
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley . 14.618224212679124
Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 12.871491771195782
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . 13.139056099949027
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some <UNK> neighbour , who could not be enough <UNK> , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 22.40494989868137

She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . 18.849596603270665
I have not been accustomed to such language as this . 8.510519584251819
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . 21.48975056851809
It was in the <UNK> and the <UNK> , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . 8.103989458716553
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities <UNK> herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . 19.839188043201887
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> . 10.96962106424404
She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece . 19.09251121137757
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s . 7.203550381135409
In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . 11.339463162405515
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . 5.4628786025120935
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 18.321012489632793
With many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs . 18.771051851261003
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in <UNK> ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 20.863093020990068
<UNK> check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and addresses . 76.39980155469542
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B . 17.045602227989466
But our visitor was very obstinate . 11.852365831104986
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . " However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather <UNK> , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . 23.262916036916106
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man . 20.984048647434005
She felt <UNK> the justice of Mr . Darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 13.949514898853703
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do ! 6.744017233338743
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . " Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . 15.617373043347834
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia . 13.752158195216568
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . 6.473364139102448
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power . 10.559304377876481
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> . 17.23684541441463
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and <UNK> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so <UNK> by any woman as he was by her . 16.380815756790025
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned . 18.514479026327113
" You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . 13.393946700771085
Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . 7.101014023146011
The room in which the ladies sat was <UNK> . 10.568561084130618
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . 14.592725207956637
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> ! 16.918208412170973
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane . 7.3624080226530255
<UNK> that may be , you are <UNK> to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs . 12.809323070103673
Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . 13.413406574227531
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it . 15.075341382526078
But I confess they would have no charms for me . 9.745177355570998
" Good Heaven ! 9.037245073030142

My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . 13.5472434977437
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments . 14.770246116404255
Poor dear child ! 13.455029583313491
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 14.945179965100102
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . " Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . 11.997157242807189
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago . " " I have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said Mrs . 12.44162077450422
What is to become of us ! 7.817374197286911
It is such a <UNK> to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . 13.69080985923565
<UNK> after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . 28.719460043451853
The path just admitted three . 16.43382611392814
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . 11.096642414880153
I am so grieved for him . 5.535029379442102
" A man who has once been refused ! 14.316377231513322
" You quite <UNK> Mr . Darcy . 7.41301167913169
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . 12.71445624437633
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly <UNK> , she seated herself . 20.55660090735294
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . 23.92089741906792
Mr . Darcy replied with great <UNK> , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley . 8.612508555050686
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . 17.93310635317246
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the <UNK> of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . 17.97754791550703
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . 15.859664138775782
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn . 15.147779949034744
Believe her to be deceived by all means . 8.799352428537862
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 11.80110570364706
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . 11.764177181352862
CHAPTER X . 7.2234956205320096
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . 10.55891384466895
Your ' s , very sincerely , " <UNK> . 8.10893600971381
Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him . 9.167863685537585
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment . 24.428009488331345
Mr . Collins ' s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . 9.91601737479862
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . 12.028275715365238
Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 9.576009782159783
I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 14.063141619259149
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 8.896186145825942
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . 13.522436470672003
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . 10.619220845053176
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most <UNK> character ! 14.0363693137604
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , <UNK> hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . 28.825166309681634
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his <UNK> were at the same time so vague and <UNK> , that her mother , though often <UNK> , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . 21.310100185928228
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh . 10.57283680008745
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 12.690344021959069
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! <UNK> our surprise . 20.177869982139324
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <UNK> . 15.987574690151742
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 8.76621884982239
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . 13.065724737923128
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the <UNK> property of some one or other of their daughters . 19.65181576370588
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . 4.733216422301
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . 17.18012988590436
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . 11.888251713634704
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . 10.91984166568009
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 13.892683593064257
He has a very <UNK> eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas <UNK> her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady <UNK> . " " You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas . 17.13491025613155
Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 14.112910265470642
" They have both , " said she , " been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . 8.66274480454656
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth ! 12.126174458363172
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . " " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley . 14.539274334181087
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general . 12.583027989647938
" Your ' s sincerely , c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 11.342523825514156
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 11.436846757171896
But let me advise you to think better of it . 8.191066711941579
I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 10.290415848235204
Poor Charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . 17.69048800329686
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , <UNK> love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means <UNK> , though it could not be exactly defined . 16.267165289941563
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . 12.869414383938897
" I am all astonishment . 4.258398243169042
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they <UNK> . 11.35273550285703
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . 10.202837996683233
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
The extravagance and general <UNK> which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 18.202162225615975
Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . 6.637737145295689
and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! 14.044110295147757
I shall <UNK> it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . " And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh ! 15.92252209202072
Are the others coming out ? " " I do not know . 7.90954670059908
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh . 16.007166541495224
They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . 18.7695497124638
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs . 8.132029410661643
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially to her friend . 12.612027474621433
Hurst ' s gown " Here she was interrupted again . 13.288530573068215
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 13.738889702690953
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband . 8.5179777814315
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 15.892184368154203
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <UNK> and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " Wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of accents , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right . 19.409490800714305
I did not expect such a compliment . " " Did not you ? 7.617108584112888
Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . 9.02765733435351
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <UNK> , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room . 14.149010913778154
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . 17.589368451744132
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . 13.370016271986833
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <UNK> of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . 16.809987746925152
We had better not mention it . 6.901406250186666
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to <UNK> her confidence in it . 14.333563963238566
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 12.160589966440382
How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! 27.153732133615936
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not <UNK> their own , so much the better . 12.019784124352089
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and <UNK> them up , though as she never came without <UNK> some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or <UNK> , she seldom went away without leaving them more <UNK> than she found them . 28.210789272696196
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . " " What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? 13.638942704798252
Oh ! 4.144033740195585
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 13.443776425962657
Give me farther particulars . 13.266633639890928
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? " " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . 13.096854495759105
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . " " Aye that is because you have the right disposition . 11.982407288360644
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . 16.497382246555073
I know how much you dislike him . " " You know nothing of the matter . 7.178380489189438
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 21.61507399404038
It was to this effect " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well . 18.29610818121222
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and <UNK> manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . 16.995307387798377
The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 17.688544780864593
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to <UNK> from the <UNK> qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . 19.70421494245766
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " <UNK> as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 18.392066978768604
But these things happen so often ! 16.054726100308738
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and <UNK> every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the <UNK> of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 17.760357098618815
. F . . Some states do not allow <UNK> of certain implied <UNK> or the exclusion or limitation of certain <UNK> of damages . 40.97616988597948
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 15.674457133073862
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded . 8.931220169351878
But there are two things that I want very much to know one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . " " <UNK> ! 13.814146215945254
Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 12.960629858811359
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first . 13.928762232885981
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you . 11.968289017031871
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs . 16.522449596630043
Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! And to the <UNK> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . 16.533478614158497
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore <UNK> Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 12.5353116295872
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 9.388788303401594
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 16.05375314836119
They followed her into the dining parlour . 11.39864879856468
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill <UNK> of Lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . 20.35938021695335
Not these two or three years perhaps . " " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can . 12.075944685704147
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? 12.868076617863922
I will try again . 5.703995163146664
It originated in Mrs . 6.6795104158824525
These recollections will not do at all . 9.43079641345777
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy . 21.78384118322929
Philips . The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . 12.269483834576747
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . 16.194263317113176
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
What are we to do ! " would they often <UNK> in the bitterness of <UNK> . 14.897476077285322
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . " Elizabeth could not <UNK> a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . 15.158694195755167
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a <UNK> library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read <UNK> . Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose <UNK> ' s <UNK> . 27.002671463530735
Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley . 12.528993180478166
Collins . 2.4214537247244583
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and <UNK> to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head . 13.028617793708268
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . 5.24739247172245
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet . 11.022591122124888
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <UNK> them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 24.420582547791184
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his <UNK> when he speaks . 19.39945494006129
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . 18.419582288538045
Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " As Mrs . 11.422638326896257
Your ' s , c . 5.426737047224089
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <UNK> depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <UNK> would have mortified her so much . 19.327714792819922
<UNK> ' s note <UNK> and <UNK> changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book . 34.85309036421419
I cannot do justice to his kindness . 7.317395678850751
Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 17.97153122573261
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way . 8.804129882696433
She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . 14.798999551334976
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . 12.3080992973745
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . 15.84986626727267
In a <UNK> voice Mrs . 12.077957763615753
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 10.574500844191373
It is of all subjects my delight . 7.864408477013528
Bennet with civil self command to Miss Lucas . 12.925620599786297
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <UNK> composure . 11.757921695552033
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 17.855202555139545
She had no fear of its <UNK> farther , through his means . 14.326601860246754
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 12.307852941848749
Bennet <UNK> the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . 10.450318585884531
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or <UNK> reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . 20.613944202035242
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . " From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . 15.397686486869988
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . 12.755443845097107
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 17.293335538989776
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 12.803581645315536
Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits . 17.57328761999503
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! 10.912017910117296
Your sweetness and <UNK> are really <UNK> ; I do not know what to say to you . 15.097070893355246
but there were two or three much <UNK> in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to <UNK> it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . 23.295754640816703
Adieu . 4.786647597434485
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , Mrs . 8.91802327908583
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <UNK> <UNK> better than <UNK> ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 21.969811525192775
That he was surprised by the <UNK> was evident ; he <UNK> it however with <UNK> , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner . 17.051802091730256
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . 3.9523975759987184
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . 6.882177468294463
During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <UNK> , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . 17.577581765049995
Such <UNK> <UNK> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <UNK> , are not worth a regret . 26.329040279943726
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 10.419661239464777
He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 15.287580238604729
London Printed for T . 14.15070991601398
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . 16.18428720098765
But we must <UNK> the tide of malice , and <UNK> into the wounded <UNK> of each other , the <UNK> of sisterly consolation . " Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " <UNK> as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is <UNK> that one false step <UNK> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <UNK> than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 28.98362613359078
Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . 9.12085628477658
" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . " " It is no such thing . 11.15476252208552
The adieu is <UNK> itself . 19.783202911023448
Catherine , weak <UNK> , irritable , and completely under Lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self <UNK> and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . 24.23070213908943
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley is not he ? 9.690696048578804
<UNK> <UNK> it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 19.157725282069695
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 15.065995574274389
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter . 17.66570524650299
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? 12.25444066116182
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . " " If I were as rich as Mr . Darcy , " cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , " I should not care how proud I was . 12.979032015973473
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . 13.8232683942997
If gratitude and esteem are good <UNK> of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 25.961911529333644
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you ! 8.677777269723283
It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister ' s being in town . 9.768011341575704
" Lizzy , you must not do so . 4.091877505628336
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much . 8.00824612462532
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 21.854598592467504
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour . 18.85180992135508
Excuse me for I must speak plainly . 12.125048857345686
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 7.766798678346001
She is gone down to her uncle at <UNK> ; gone to stay . 12.485278128657555
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> . 12.744908842797956
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? 17.632042186751665
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it <UNK> . 13.985355258771369
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried . 7.550353892689846
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . 13.173356122452613
But to be <UNK> without <UNK> or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone . 16.73064094606052
Bennet was <UNK> in her acknowledgments . 9.888393645587055
It <UNK> because of the efforts of <UNK> of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life . 22.776820456637612

It is every way <UNK> ! " Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> . 22.033645003906674
Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? " " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . 22.370842424846415
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . 12.99981149834625
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . 15.8611388697365
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 10.70224888768189
She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <UNK> him with fears and regrets in <UNK> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 14.09541932338451
There was no help for it however . 6.814460120005326
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her . 13.3140563077447
my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " Oh , lord ! 9.429339668498686
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 12.800172570042415
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 18.88346180622843
I speak nothing but the truth . 5.970931819905953

But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so . 10.856321875233562
You are not well enough ; you cannot go yourself . " Elizabeth hesitated , but her <UNK> <UNK> under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . 17.578735459326182
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . 6.740216196983796
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? 13.717144921204818
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 11.021856022854113
Bennet , who <UNK> with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be <UNK> enough . 16.10768875090819
Why must she be <UNK> about the country , because her sister had a cold ? 14.174738411639124
If you ' <UNK> believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 15.385193375683093
Gardiner , though unknown . 5.769821366754246
How are they even to be discovered ? 10.319909225659815
Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them . 7.915406230457854
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . 13.645303341042565
CHAPTER XVI . 7.2234956205320096
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street . 16.391490854286854
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . 24.28810211599155
This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . 15.834211879412317
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much . 14.308473197054546
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . 9.870010363025933
Gardiner . 2.6911073080185557
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church . 14.365600734138171
The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood . 29.49470083342421
" It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . 6.036517936167478
He can be a <UNK> companion if he thinks it worth his while . 19.062874042179544
GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . 11.145301250541376
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him . 11.809454735999637
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . " " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 10.1975221569865
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . 10.779177835404163
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . " " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . " " In <UNK> your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were <UNK> . 16.424318238431717
" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . 4.657708984465886
And a special licence . 11.899767706485557
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be <UNK> to her nieces . 16.34255345702725
What relates to yourself , is as follows . 9.57869036796355
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity . 24.468664116080507
They <UNK> every attempt of Mrs . 11.83429187272365
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . 13.719298633348584
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him . 35.27103363387648
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 15.968235867189232
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her <UNK> , by dwelling on them . 9.12980103292214
It cannot be concealed from any one . 8.91942683139588
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . 14.2626844415423
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? 7.570228167828479
Till this moment , I never knew myself . " From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . 13.0449653386428
Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . 11.236874192949042
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . " Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . 15.1744354707465
" Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight . 14.984825739294505
You need not . 4.780477294162442
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the <UNK> to the <UNK> , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a <UNK> in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the <UNK> of which he attended himself . 16.165661253523446
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline . 13.537408879029355
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? 19.34741116058514
But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . 11.398385071453461
I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " " And they must marry ! 10.263188761038228
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much <UNK> ; but when Mrs . 19.96683023142221
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character . 19.668998756394398
He now wished it more than ever . 8.479190301781891
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . 11.563355815743778
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature . 22.91018182937561
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth . 9.224226542733806
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <UNK> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble <UNK> , and extensive patronage . 22.923761899984935
" So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find . 8.102028945474075
One seems so <UNK> without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth . 10.96903344736108
Good Heaven ! 11.220258405327106
Bennet was quite in the <UNK> . 6.784265936683678
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <UNK> circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her <UNK> and steady candour always <UNK> for <UNK> , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 26.75508729097817
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected . 11.349837486975781
At night she opened her heart to Jane . 9.548820479820202
<UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . 15.872316486682024
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 18.31419472209886
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 13.096550177598258
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . 13.370927097288646
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . 10.418900895541391
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . 7.001595399082322
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over . 19.596971970603985
If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession . 25.96673710723755
Bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at <UNK> , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to <UNK> you when your father is dead . I shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . 13.578847703392698
And what sort of table do they keep ? 13.078071955832375
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . 10.332458433458106
She could think only of her letter . 5.415324193288741
I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . 12.17959963201303
I wonder who first discovered the <UNK> of poetry in driving away love ! " " I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy . 18.619029822299023
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . 9.957771955484494
As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the <UNK> . 21.27942847895226
CHAPTER XII . 7.2234956205320096
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 16.591846859311936
It was gratitude . <UNK> , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <UNK> and <UNK> of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 22.166259651875055
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . 8.419628605389972
Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 19.886455160261992
Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . 11.192741185797352
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction . 16.14029720699374
Three daughters married ! 14.48824403687399
" You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose because he danced with her twice . 11.055186704817952
The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of <UNK> , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her <UNK> <UNK> . 22.51062244108605
" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <UNK> , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss <UNK> ' s . " " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . " " Oh ! 19.093902675966888
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . 11.454061811369028
" You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried . 6.695042732236459
" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . 15.387568324430406
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . 11.517812583908668
I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . 14.2276783191691
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must <UNK> him from such <UNK> misconduct as I have suffered by . 13.666861236140077
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 12.588147691155331
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with . 23.28280990323611
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its <UNK> . 12.350103194646858
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . 6.390770511833151
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 18.249010298520997
I am very , very sorry . 4.390745127536551
My aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . " " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . 12.586977317209094
After walking several miles in a <UNK> manner , and too <UNK> to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their <UNK> , that it was time to be at home . 17.551982427308413
You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <UNK> is denied me , because you have always so much . " Mr . Bingley arrived . 14.594703228636625
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down . 11.236914486082267
Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master . 17.19894101894982
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 11.038441833823857
Most people start at our Web site which has the <UNK> <UNK> search <UNK> www . gutenberg . org This Web site <UNK> information about Project Gutenberg tm , including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation , how to help produce our new eBooks , and how to <UNK> to our <UNK> <UNK> to hear about new eBooks . 75.27846463959969
" While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . 11.034765363981508
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . 11.874336589251719
PRIDE PREJUDICE . 9.106582046840119
When this was done , she had a less active part to play . 10.043851695074691
Very well . 5.045833874321892
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 14.840006573579442
I must beg to return to the house . " And she rose as she spoke . 8.180580124297789
Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his <UNK> at whist , enumerating all the <UNK> at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he <UNK> his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . 26.009062137352807
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 7.639252703176428
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . 10.146486048936211
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . 15.561589317888368
With the <UNK> concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 17.283753430777686
<UNK> wore a happier aspect . 29.765695919193583
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them . 24.961370912288963
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were <UNK> ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . 18.77549095480271
They were natural and just . 6.813792650098374
No , no , you shall not deceive me . 6.301771064825793
Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for . 6.048967071612367
Bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . 14.320335900132928
She answered with equal indifference and <UNK> , and the other said no more . 11.205049086385124
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 16.989694581377485
<UNK> and <UNK> support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg tm ' s <UNK> and <UNK> that the Project Gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come . 56.089955351894254
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them . 18.181072327155686
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . 14.27567926849612
He was full of joy and attention . 7.4476855956782755
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <UNK> , distance becomes no evil . 27.122409728321173
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . 13.673941004674914
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
<UNK> , <UNK> , . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations . 33.09079057746304
<UNK> felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them . 9.362973080614102
" I never heard any thing so abominable . 8.239819597366454
<UNK> him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her . 23.72977975414941
Every <UNK> <UNK> in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther <UNK> of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago <UNK> his <UNK> in the affair ; that proud and <UNK> as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had <UNK> brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be <UNK> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <UNK> or <UNK> habits . 25.29698405322086
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does . 9.357714148979202
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . 18.56012444234584
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two . 11.355971898813783
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . 11.466659283226832
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err . 24.904798328896405
Bingley and talked of Mrs . 4.190298351920115
It must be an amusing study . " " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing . 18.050522864819033
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 16.19124473115362
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . " CHAPTER V . 26.052619720655557
I must have employment and society . 6.821846837814515
It would have suited me in every respect . " " How should you have liked making sermons ? " " <UNK> well . 16.52263477055163
Forster . 3.108434207919131
We acted with the best intentions . " " Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " He brought it with him for us to see . " Jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to Elizabeth . 15.153699894741273
Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <UNK> , if she could suppose him to be in her power . 14.851596748905383
But I have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous <UNK> , boy in the world . " Elizabeth almost stared at her . " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she . 16.630069492963088
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " " Are you , indeed ? 7.938617146570515
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have <UNK> . 17.961718336088857
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <UNK> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 14.912348094317087
Perhaps he thought her too young . 7.810131424434135
Her air was not <UNK> , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . 16.754846861501353
Jane now came up . 6.432012977604276
you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 16.565568127937265
Bennet , who assured him with some <UNK> that they were very well able to keep a good <UNK> , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <UNK> . 14.092024650842397
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious <UNK> , denoted a recollection of Jane , not <UNK> by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . 18.422685948218348
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . 12.148219301089554
" I admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he . 10.46693980442748
You have liked many a <UNK> person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! 14.094993469881926
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 15.476211853678064
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . 7.816799911925977
" I expected at least that the <UNK> were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! " " La ! 13.949119087089775
" Kitty and I are going <UNK> to sit in my dressing room . " Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room . 15.743557128396256
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self importance and humility . 22.217532542794054
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . 21.004641917025126
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . 12.426517898182162
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 13.949104788619584
While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little <UNK> by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . 20.365996830221206
. F . . Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph . F . , this work is provided to you ' <UNK> <UNK> ' , <UNK> NO <UNK> WARRANTIES OF ANY <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF <UNK> OR <UNK> FOR ANY <UNK> . 120.42348701908413
Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise . 6.808204516189721
She went on . 4.297602787271201
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . 13.8856466013863
I will not tell you what it is . 4.791341193674952
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 14.125184186788974
there is not a bit of fish to be got to day . 8.949654184583393
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . 10.518008227727739
what does he say ? 6.8025851692950905
No , no , let me <UNK> for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret . 12.258538583430603
I shall be back by dinner . " " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . 14.943089672787378
" He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . 12.884474185843207
He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would <UNK> more birds on the first of <UNK> , than any body else in the country . 15.844330826197831
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion . 16.50436430434398
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? 9.928479553084362
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley . 9.318164555335406
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . 7.2542856255091035
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 13.464760414807502
" But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing . 8.602124180321777
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent . 19.366591452567732
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
They had frequently been staying with her in town . 9.350058949196722
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <UNK> . 14.334252767041933
nonsense , how can you talk so ! 9.91855074663679
what hours of <UNK> we shall spend ! 19.465420115569668
Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . 15.133404431686428
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . 10.42934211634839
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . 8.075257818341408
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . 9.090338496033404
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 10.160512139891075
Every thing <UNK> what is strong already . 20.660461219000453
Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 9.217117397894464
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 14.759286892675513
CHAPTER VI . 7.22349596044539
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 18.21202857041291
She then <UNK> again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . " " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . " " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something <UNK> <UNK> in the usual <UNK> of such a meeting . 21.326137540637518
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . 14.959347704201939
A great deal more passed at the other table . 12.143963717348386
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your <UNK> , to discover the name of your admirer . 24.18386643210037
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? 16.92800724347119
They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned . 19.69704039086763
I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . " " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <UNK> of you . 14.714511816486338
dear me ! 4.699896549664798
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . 13.276492263993857
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 20.544960915007646
" Upon my word , " said Mrs . 5.535403733587921
You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match . 18.55785454175233
Bennet . 2.1934480210742664
I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! 5.954991412746284
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . 14.119209295132078
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law . " The loss of her daughter made Mrs . 18.1467289733204
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so <UNK> that I cannot answer for being <UNK> . 18.308564253847088
His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 11.593890116787582
By the Author of " Sense and Sensibility . " VOL . 13.56842620319583
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . " " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the <UNK> manner which I see so many women ' s do . 17.31404312467664
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . 18.998073732597682
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 15.844623344501914
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now . 9.239857699804924
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . 9.669887224101887
After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . 17.997467958565803
" You forget that I have made no answer . 7.415829147028164
She is well , and <UNK> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . Your ' s , c . 9.93784712847892
" Of a fine , stout , <UNK> love it may . 12.752985774705603
Her cousin <UNK> his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the <UNK> of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . " It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . 14.112921458464553
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . 12.987522502857468
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . 29.45921910179424
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . 12.648518323076614
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> . 14.11741357086374
They will take care not to <UNK> their income . 15.638569131969835
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . 16.712683262909035
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well . 15.499619574216341
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . " " To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . " " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . " " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . 15.797974940044428
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two <UNK> with Jane again , and the two <UNK> with Lizzy , and the <UNK> " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! 15.394502885612098
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have <UNK> either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister . 18.433511477073488
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . 23.529754772097093
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 16.279010548497244
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be <UNK> at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 12.065365501165457
Consider Mr . Collins ' s respectability , and Charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . 13.310069536409985
Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . " " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . " " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " I honour your circumspection . 10.268288848895347
" What can be the meaning of this ! " said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone . 7.25521766021178
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase . 20.25008535642608
Gardiner , rendered <UNK> by Elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . 21.14872691206182
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs . 7.530338332331576
I do not deserve it . 4.851116539379791
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . 11.617429453592713
In this <UNK> state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 17.06617954567707
Mr . Bennet accepted the <UNK> , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . 21.56067174999614
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 7.1556230452105405
You thought me then <UNK> of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . 14.058085024079748
Bennet was quite disconcerted . 7.246377569918905
Mr . Wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a <UNK> as she could . 14.278684349033012
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet ' s manor . 10.916304749075369
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head <UNK> acutely . 24.85819853459456
Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . 18.468263194586108
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that <UNK> is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . 31.084407771299965
Now was the moment for her resolution to be <UNK> , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s . 11.740448166755716
Mr . what ' s his name . 4.643007756010076
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . 11.659046251002996
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane " I hope and trust they will yet be happy . 14.230067943605198
They are destined for each other by the voice of every <UNK> of their <UNK> houses ; and what is to divide them ? 22.858995598681847
But , really , I know not what to say . 4.27838037708091
But here , by carrying with me one <UNK> source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <UNK> . 21.259339233671177
But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand . 9.518228782774756
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her <UNK> and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place . 18.26810857731383
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . 9.11023875396291
Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 13.798465602819457
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 15.252322416870514
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to <UNK> , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to <UNK> his prosperous love . 27.893183478450016
" What could he mean ? 6.882417499435698
Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . 7.186967414956853
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly <UNK> . 15.114583811451558
She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . 14.741688458903905
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . 18.674443750021553
Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London . 8.139356354733055
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that . 13.912331642393038
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frightened out of my <UNK> ; and have such <UNK> , such <UNK> , all over me , such <UNK> in my side , and pains in my head , and such <UNK> at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . 18.875904993714965
Two <UNK> , however , were plainly <UNK> from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been <UNK> used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 18.067849106153016
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring . 4.748039196224547
We had better go into the <UNK> . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly group ' <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage . 17.849218708948598
The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . 15.067470591356885
<UNK> nature is so prone to fall into it ! 22.752634348426707
Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . 9.335355919581927
my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine . 9.244392955516446
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one <UNK> , she may have less trouble in <UNK> a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 18.021914388715704
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
<UNK> the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it cannot be long . " He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away . 18.828952408066336
You will hardly bear to be long <UNK> by Jane . 13.882779640610591
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . 15.696196542692721
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . 13.372082348674173
On this subject , what can you have to say ? 7.926040753462493
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . 11.987981051813165
Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously . " Mrs . 16.25079134526759
Her mother <UNK> <UNK> , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 23.969502386828395
Who should suffer but myself ? 14.792039124964184
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 12.4157836608933
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . 9.525932197371947
She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <UNK> , she would have <UNK> every better feeling to worldly advantage . 20.16293996895447
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most <UNK> creatures in the world . 12.010682020416192
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <UNK> to any human being . 19.048806326072544
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley . 11.642226509225294
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . 6.281816610531339
In such an <UNK> my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I <UNK> upon his goodness . " " Oh ! 18.0148996673732
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the <UNK> , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 19.236212361459312
Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the <UNK> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room . 20.094970025182214
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . 7.908489067887338
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of <UNK> and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 22.438726038635323
" Oh ! 3.731104652284054
Mr . and Mrs . 2.334144763093918
It is impossible that he should still love me . " After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on <UNK> their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water <UNK> , there <UNK> to be a little alteration . 23.887741289104746
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . " She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . " Again his astonishment was <UNK> ; and he looked at her with an expression of <UNK> incredulity and mortification . 19.12825673020199
It would be dreadful ! 7.695545290734712
The children have been wanting me this half hour . 14.401382329216839
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild <UNK> , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character . 21.361787330067287
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . 14.981094961965335
My father bears it better . 10.466523953985545
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . 11.142027865779307
He has children of his own , and may have more . 6.22337798958
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . 10.67527461051426
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! 20.10111346506681
The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <UNK> of elegant nuptials , fine <UNK> , new carriages , and servants . 17.89008740863204
" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . " While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . 14.968249022069266
She opened the door , and met Maria in the <UNK> place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza ! 14.836463113498194
Not a soul knew of it , but <UNK> . 11.371008677446941
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 14.13202166012464
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . 15.081487662580024
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 12.993314849222756
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . 8.374388764161411
The <UNK> was <UNK> to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so <UNK> a <UNK> . 24.84731980482261
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid . 32.84348670128071
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . " " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger . 14.5678703305217
what felicity ! 6.379521087930022
Mr . Darcy was <UNK> him with <UNK> wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . 14.887702861297914
He does not want abilities . 10.007700199621047
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you . 10.779696527980233
And , besides , no <UNK> of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then supposing them to be in London . 11.299219364251847
" The conduct of neither , if <UNK> examined , will be <UNK> ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . 14.880135272737592
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . 15.509012295855005
But the case is this . 4.727084377796718
no it is not for me to be driven away by Mr . Darcy . 6.423390740844164
Jenkinson ' s room . 6.344135165040779
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 18.980153587014836
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . 10.228484842184734
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 8.89864320202775
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . 13.332362772860908
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 14.593292961288025
CHAPTER VI . 7.22349596044539
Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 12.41538881759749
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her . 13.448788000466939
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? 7.4824820263031935
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 17.824922417898527
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . 9.75843970093798
And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? 8.520693083296091
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 6.114669851572672
I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . " " I desire you will do no such thing . 14.33353735231543
<UNK> is subject to the trademark license , especially <UNK> <UNK> . 30.760148005843277
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 12.563052443124263
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 35.20484809658895
" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . 6.498036677736208
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham . 6.53272760388485
We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 11.57737797005012
That he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion . 10.533771611636869
c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 11.749229143130556
They would doubtless be <UNK> with the generality of female minds . 24.896897011957304
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . 11.136504217704646
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> . 17.790091723634422
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . 23.781935664248646
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 19.066474181315108
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 9.670132726538807
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . 19.532803422105545
The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 14.998384365069766
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " " I would by no means <UNK> any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . 16.685586704209623
CHAPTER XV . 7.2234956205320096
We all love to <UNK> , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 18.67970956326097
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 14.922367080189645
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first <UNK> his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . 16.865542779756392
Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . 15.040942890862262
Hurst and Miss Bingley . 4.748793081480914
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a <UNK> , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . " " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . 17.258528230235807
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . 19.73309003504835
It was as follows " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous <UNK> you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . 22.382433859243545
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment . 16.08001017578584
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 9.795914087471495
Well , but now for my news it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? 10.758643915040969
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? 15.396843479871903
Such a charming man ! so handsome ! 13.869019574223303
" Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . " He should be particularly happy at any time , c . 10.938016338281967
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 9.369778547778676
Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 8.889656027628739
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister . 15.335569301821495
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time . 18.22000450120723
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject . 13.985386272065222
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
If I could but see you as happy ! 7.674995249792362
Well , he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 12.229368867323048
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not <UNK> , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte . 17.205980023739247
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was . 14.227149367760854
To his <UNK> engagement with Miss De Bourgh ? 25.042630034263
Jane was not happy . 3.884093578525815
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child . 14.363201777386768
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 10.718957665448164
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . 15.615281685583264
I knew that Mr . Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . 6.498463079117106
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . 15.942075835103289
" I do not get on at all . 4.688350494056878
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . 13.904150476428805
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! 17.63055955026035
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <UNK> by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . 18.56251926719319
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . " " Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . 11.512827587623176
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . 19.736643346035198
I am not at all afraid of her dying . 6.741354883362471
They walked on , without knowing in what direction . 10.230798135736157
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . 7.893751092600909
Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side . 14.01019479991025
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 12.88065147095731
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <UNK> , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 11.963774878805127
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
I am so pleased so happy . 6.481206212404336
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged . 16.688426233684762
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <UNK> to that evening , " said Elizabeth . 12.368961604144037
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 12.408073858856781
Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . " " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . " " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . 11.362353444493548
I have no such <UNK> to resent . 9.727015307889083
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 15.015931876158543
" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . " " I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice . 10.987491072089892
and it was not wholly without foundation . 7.1000988854009215
But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 12.555169058308223
Well , how pleased I am ! 7.636170932023111
That is the place to get husbands . 8.890763416026866
<UNK> back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write <UNK> . 16.93987787730115
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . " " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister . 14.339760788913264
He <UNK> how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an <UNK> manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there . 18.685958257139486
He placed himself by her . 6.806682487915113
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was Elizabeth ' s intimate friend . 14.158587357328908
why did she come ? 8.284908004633134
With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . 15.384836568387124
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 12.332175685813235
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . 7.378466702564264
What do you keep winking at me for ? 13.566779083417085
The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for <UNK> as may be <UNK> to himself and not offensive to his patron . 17.923097110595233
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . " Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . 13.755206832914036
I never saw such <UNK> , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " Mrs . 9.402434644844119
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish . 11.661716826787542
CHAPTER II . 6.996859120965737
I have by no means done . 5.740150755595595
Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the <UNK> of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . 14.963563587024476
The hill , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . 21.60402213464562
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . 7.115579922116781
CHAPTER XIV . 7.2234956205320096
my dear , " continued Mrs . 4.373869957282716
" <UNK> Oh ! 9.58090419263397
They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! 11.287576911149674
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to <UNK> . 20.62561115799493
Oh , no . " " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . " " No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . " " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . " She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . 12.788098018240946
<UNK> , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . 12.079148788094713
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer . 11.218489387664683
She had got rid of two of the <UNK> which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . 15.62589027008471
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , soon collected them round the table . 20.603278411620476
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s . 21.03590583104326
and his sisters are charming women . 8.373622943593931
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to <UNK> people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? 15.279684852103918
Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! 12.170668550884375
Mr . Bennet ' s <UNK> were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! 15.267397357275614
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . 7.935346791605129
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . 11.291013961404923
They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins ' s admiration . 7.9710575360578275
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 12.699167613683635
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! 15.723442454205781
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . 12.644175316732815
<UNK> me in silence . 9.112053136645597
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease . 13.415199480084466
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great <UNK> . 10.310231868944228
At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . " With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 21.64130200777025
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . 13.92529360466379
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise . 34.24354454106165
They have some of the finest woods in the country . " Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <UNK> . 12.113491637064854
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . " " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose . 8.15844333501646
Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her . 21.82761789766739
Are not you curious to hear how it was <UNK> ? " " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . " " La ! 12.735306572383129
Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their <UNK> in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites . 16.82692401861741
Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 13.579829113232634
But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 17.319450686935152
" I am trying to make it out . " " And what is your success ? " She shook her head . 9.841790175480748
Besides , it will not much signify what one <UNK> this summer , after the shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . " " Are they indeed ? " cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . 15.419771120243439
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention . 18.94645071276247
What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! 12.199156237820945
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 13.835832289995276
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to <UNK> , and was but slightly affected by his <UNK> of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the <UNK> altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh . 24.415120799363372
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . 17.581329611733373
It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . 13.556450142674462
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 15.806602730581558
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . 10.821929426136684
" Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . 8.428854096615535
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . " " Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> . 27.015211847487794
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 12.938358990707622
In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <UNK> for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 15.717108719819796
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! 13.18412419737188
What could be more natural than his asking you again ? 13.144122702890828
The next was in these words . 7.583752462066989
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street . 26.82266550807826
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . " " <UNK> their income ! 23.118224221571246
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 16.92299901037665
Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . 22.6384098834357
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . " " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . 14.955842167281855
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . " Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . 12.488539869001684
She longed to see Mrs . 6.469403917571576
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . 8.968626282376423
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . 19.148235593010572
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 10.78609732069341
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 12.977540633417723
Philips ' s manners and politeness . 8.288527421645353
It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity . 33.21710205012731
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . 8.576026512422942
" If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs . 8.791704926062101
Well ! 4.840860784983619
They are wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? " " They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . " " But if you have got them to day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered . " She did at last <UNK> from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . 13.823296452149924
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . 16.344071236153834
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . 10.562899636733103
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <UNK> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 18.65931006338093
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . 7.040482135024198
Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed it is distressing . One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 15.138409292129172
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 14.446626891030379
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . 10.373400782890252
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement . 11.845133426652177
" What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . 6.612936164520407
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 14.667236406984827
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so <UNK> . 13.601357230347617
He owns it himself without disguise . " " No " said Darcy , " I have made no such pretension . 11.284675905016497
She saw herself the object of attention , to <UNK> and to <UNK> of them at present unknown . 13.129539770369929
CHAPTER XVI . 7.2234956205320096
But it was not to be . 2.8732982798722473
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . 5.196946293140229
Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . 10.71978197555038
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as <UNK> , were in very good time . 16.936902807807865
Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 16.08861448896914
where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , <UNK> from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without <UNK> a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . 13.985654491864556
" Your ' s , c . " This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be <UNK> , by the sister at least . 14.318943217493832
" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said Mr . Gardiner . 7.306963273278576
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 10.394137985039556
She is quite a little creature . 7.505400761343929
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 5.936133449565725
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . " " Not as you represent it . 10.006787367732455
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 10.081248012624702
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <UNK> , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her <UNK> and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , Lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum . 18.093400928702486
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very <UNK> reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to <UNK> and <UNK> to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 17.97215893511881
Reynolds was of no trifling nature . 10.20159933673991
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation . 17.23748567998784
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last <UNK> , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were <UNK> answered . 14.700398284211674
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am . 14.262654107404666
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . 17.27236928478866
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone . 20.80175493495133
It is not likely that money should be very <UNK> on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more <UNK> , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ? 19.469138687858003
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the <UNK> of a considerable <UNK> , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . 30.071040392013128
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States . 19.506583453884
oh ! 7.358159927180991
" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . 3.887523044458151
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile it was decided . 14.437487252336025
Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . 17.90608514901884
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 13.999531705114105
Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend . 8.0178685297446
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . 9.385724098440281
And poor Mr . Darcy ! 6.433225463918819
There was no want of discourse . 7.9940869285184855
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 14.846861217956551
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . 11.42970187673827
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 15.464041421363135
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though <UNK> with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 11.584948474674341
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer . 19.0492361698925
Mrs . 2.172597563893648
It was really a very handsome thought . 7.410083009534657
I am sorry to pain you but so it was . 5.97059898029044
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . 14.742720111084564
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . 20.39628756890972
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion . 20.15200040427479
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in <UNK> affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? 17.49188888610013
YOU AGREE THAT YOU <UNK> NO <UNK> FOR <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . F . . YOU AGREE THAT THE <UNK> , THE <UNK> <UNK> , AND ANY <UNK> <UNK> THIS <UNK> <UNK> NOT <UNK> <UNK> TO YOU FOR <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> OR <UNK> DAMAGES <UNK> <UNK> YOU <UNK> <UNK> OF THE <UNK> OF <UNK> <UNK> . 623.7806629455795
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth <UNK> out the coffee , in so close a <UNK> , that there was not a single <UNK> near her , which would admit of a chair . 19.296091215444463
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 13.363292791144744
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . 12.118643937272319
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? 11.274083353215532
He has not an ill natured look . 10.993823709467641
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those <UNK> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . 19.13566385379183
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . 15.86185446330912
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . " " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! 13.583109206938994
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . 20.014785793618838
From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two <UNK> , but the ladies not having <UNK> to encounter the remains of a white <UNK> , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help . 21.86518934831094
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . 7.004082639728087
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together . 15.373773348498428
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . " " This is not to be borne . 10.002360029671648
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , <UNK> Lucases . 18.275828393083977
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . 15.535890947432954
But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . " " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " Yes . 16.03140029029874
and so did Mrs . 3.450282841527037
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . 14.357440400418582
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception . 6.098958681073564
How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr . Bingley ? " " Not at all . " " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . 13.528437974692718
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . 13.231901970985092
The <UNK> pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . 15.829035131608094
But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved shocked . 8.810357479983963
If she does not object to it , why should we ? " " Her not objecting , does not justify him . 11.137533254809213
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 11.439818415269075
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral <UNK> from the evil before them . 16.792035583915947
She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . 17.727248900332526
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few <UNK> , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <UNK> . " Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 21.95361778225325
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 16.47962232680223
Her answer was warmly in his favour . 9.90882327250931
Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . " " No , no . 5.1819895852281705
Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . 5.840323681882923
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the <UNK> of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 16.05322785563583
Whatever bears affinity to <UNK> is <UNK> . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 23.841578459567064
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . " While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much <UNK> to be kept waiting for her dinner . Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s . 21.336738256084644
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . 11.854352226689116
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 14.152518077236305
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . 13.549699616367516
<UNK> much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <UNK> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 18.044023694408736
" Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? 5.166837451794265
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the <UNK> , and was soon out of sight . 13.931932961894168
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 18.762831336419215
She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it . 18.294476100932897
And it was settled that we should all be there by <UNK> o ' clock . 17.016626455811917
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs . 20.37282357291838
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . 8.61065947172339
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks . 11.143867617215408
Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . 18.34622268114995
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . 16.90047339108576
It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ? 20.049381005270018
There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . 7.533879089423227
The particulars , I reserve till we meet . 11.375452544372287
But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ' s praise into his own hands . 16.026593461587503
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 8.597738225124163
Heaven forbid ! 13.126927883343464
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . 14.876970553486817
From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an <UNK> chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . 18.47890386102521
my dear Charlotte , impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . 20.674962319183575
Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 9.87213591549491
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the <UNK> old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain . 15.083538594067088
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . 20.924430825798506
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 13.85259813096214
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him . 9.609472136386994
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . 17.105043415064475
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 12.313876815973366
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <UNK> . 16.882783964432388
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? 19.456254916428968
They will ruin your happiness . 9.9128207337349
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . 6.130955262405714
We now come to the point . 6.374244684033883
And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned . 18.418175225965793
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 19.430934532112726
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly <UNK> at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 12.641198337491408
But that is one great difference between us . 10.590433779322126
I am glad he <UNK> here on Tuesday . 15.018740392010475
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open . 17.090945834446647
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <UNK> . " " And this is your real opinion ! 13.914110195083946
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . 12.20916737260974
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . 8.990941834771215
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> . 15.858163199721835
Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . 11.32695512034655
Their first subject was the <UNK> of the Rosings party . " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . 12.916855645088626
Perhaps I am not doing her justice . 8.906638942438844
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . 17.150369565935883
Bennet , alarmed . 3.9783748697645818
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 13.202932984689502
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , glancing at her sister and Bingley , shall take place . 15.75878964618267
Miss Bennet had <UNK> ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room . 11.219346891437711
Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 17.272029118690075
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 12.893083649567886
Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . 17.36309977546577
I know not what to think . 3.8114197230626212
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . 20.608840741303165
All loveliness and goodness as she is ! 12.871861708208609
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty . 13.73861973307297
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 14.337970769981084
CHAPTER II . 6.996859120965737
If the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the <UNK> . 35.60590044300925
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 9.48585064969141
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . 16.377359113274032
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . 15.524258398355666
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 17.128637877934526
Bennet was <UNK> the fire . 9.215056117492962
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . 11.94055281987532
But it is so strange ! " " Yes that is what makes it amusing . 11.223096110464596
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . 7.947495215333975
Good bye . 8.16715252097151
She answered him with cold civility . 9.832755598406589
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters . 17.533108087937173
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . 4.773071938723997
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be <UNK> , though it could not be <UNK> , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . 13.914126585327415
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . 16.584090190849096
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . 17.992723961268627
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by <UNK> a <UNK> , or covering a <UNK> . 29.660905543619446
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> . 12.30613194174731
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 13.17354796331656
Her <UNK> wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . 24.897340259375436
