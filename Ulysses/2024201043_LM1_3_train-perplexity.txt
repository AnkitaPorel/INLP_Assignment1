yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and <UNK> when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose <UNK> youd think it was O tragic and that <UNK> one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss <UNK> bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate <UNK> and <UNK> when he cut his toe with the razor <UNK> his corns afraid hed get <UNK> but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big <UNK> I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at <UNK> <UNK> and turned my back on him when he <UNK> out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big <UNK> I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him <UNK> death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace <UNK> out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters per <UNK> going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself <UNK> only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and <UNK> like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there <UNK> another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im <UNK> out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id <UNK> him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him <UNK> him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that <UNK> drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the <UNK> yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost <UNK> you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the <UNK> in his <UNK> I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his <UNK> and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so <UNK> in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some <UNK> Id like to sip those <UNK> green and yellow expensive drinks those <UNK> <UNK> drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the <UNK> talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful <UNK> in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in <UNK> street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed <UNK> if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come or times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and <UNK> and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a <UNK> driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to <UNK> my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina <UNK> husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called <UNK> or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it <UNK> the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like <UNK> or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if <UNK> do him any good I know they were <UNK> a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina <UNK> housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not <UNK> to see her a <UNK> that was why we had the <UNK> row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was <UNK> with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first <UNK> he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of <UNK> things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of <UNK> poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a <UNK> to her with his <UNK> kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course <UNK> me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always <UNK> on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the <UNK> I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it <UNK> her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt <UNK> the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the <UNK> takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the <UNK> when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs <UNK> that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the <UNK> villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white <UNK> she put in his tea off <UNK> wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been <UNK> in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew <UNK> every other week such a long one I did I forgot my <UNK> gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street <UNK> return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice <UNK> Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after <UNK> <UNK> of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give points in to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the <UNK> dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang <UNK> Ave Maria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his <UNK> voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along <UNK> square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to <UNK> the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those <UNK> things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their <UNK> even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air <UNK> that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the <UNK> cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the <UNK> colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I <UNK> and stopped then he <UNK> me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my <UNK> sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria <UNK> he did look a big fool <UNK> in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and <UNK> of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the <UNK> pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what <UNK> theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a <UNK> then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the big poppies because mine was the th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at <UNK> barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all <UNK> or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old <UNK> Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more <UNK> nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the <UNK> today I thought it was a <UNK> first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his <UNK> at the door he must have been a bit late because it was after when I saw the Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the <UNK> concert at <UNK> <UNK> boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose <UNK> be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an <UNK> man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him or <UNK> perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say <UNK> with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St <UNK> hall <UNK> St little chits of <UNK> they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man <UNK> is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a <UNK> I hate the mention of their politics after the war that <UNK> and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner <UNK> <UNK> G th <UNK> nd East <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> fever he was a lovely fellow in <UNK> and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old <UNK> Paul and the rest of the other old <UNK> go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even <UNK> shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in <UNK> the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La <UNK> it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like <UNK> or those sham battles on the acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won <UNK> his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a <UNK> like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and <UNK> themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit <UNK> of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides <UNK> down on me like that all the time with his big <UNK> hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his <UNK> cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly <UNK> I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of <UNK> tip cursing him to the lowest <UNK> that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long <UNK> over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at <UNK> when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and <UNK> and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and <UNK> were <UNK> silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be <UNK> for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good <UNK> for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her <UNK> she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of <UNK> stockings is <UNK> after one days wear I could have brought them back to <UNK> this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those <UNK> corsets Id want advertised cheap in the <UNK> with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line obviating that <UNK> broad appearance across the lower back to <UNK> flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from <UNK> was as flat as a <UNK> he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of <UNK> he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that <UNK> any good might <UNK> it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or <UNK> with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill <UNK> it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot <UNK> and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and <UNK> up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the years more I have of life up to no Im what am I at all Ill be in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her <UNK> on the <UNK> she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty <UNK> in <UNK> street st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs <UNK> the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master <UNK> Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her <UNK> fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old <UNK> face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers <UNK> about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for <UNK> when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him <UNK> there to be the manager he gave me a great <UNK> once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old <UNK> dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and <UNK> as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking <UNK> everything he can <UNK> off the shelves into it if I went by his <UNK> every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a <UNK> standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the <UNK> one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty <UNK> he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with <UNK> <UNK> them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a <UNK> that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his <UNK> up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the <UNK> relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was of the wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the <UNK> party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me <UNK> in the mens place <UNK> I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and <UNK> in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the <UNK> he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his <UNK> hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the <UNK> <UNK> I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday <UNK> train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of <UNK> old <UNK> the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old <UNK> and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very <UNK> and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last <UNK> paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the <UNK> came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their Rock mountain they think is so great with the red <UNK> here and there the poplars and they all <UNK> and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she called him wogger <UNK> give anything to be back in <UNK> and hear you sing Waiting and in old Madrid <UNK> is the name of those exercises he bought me one of those new some word I couldnt make out shawls amusing things but tear for the least thing still there lovely I think dont you will always think of the lovely teas we had together <UNK> currant scones and <UNK> wafers I adore well now dearest Doggerina be sure and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also Captain Grove with love yrs <UNK> Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the <UNK> at La Linea when that <UNK> <UNK> was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the <UNK> with the sashes and the things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo <UNK> sure the women were as bad in their nice white <UNK> ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog <UNK> in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the <UNK> to read that was the first I read of <UNK> Collins East <UNK> I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord <UNK> Eugene <UNK> Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs <UNK> on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from <UNK> a whore always <UNK> anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so <UNK> and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the <UNK> nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those <UNK> <UNK> on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were <UNK> when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very <UNK> to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to <UNK> him <UNK> me waiting nor <UNK> his flying feet their damn guns <UNK> and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses <UNK> whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old <UNK> the <UNK> that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old <UNK> for <UNK> in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with <UNK> smelling the place more than the old <UNK> jews in their <UNK> and <UNK> assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the <UNK> marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about <UNK> drift and Plevna and sir <UNK> <UNK> and Gordon at <UNK> lighting their pipes for them <UNK> they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the <UNK> whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so <UNK> sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old <UNK> with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah <UNK> all my <UNK> on your <UNK> of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah <UNK> <UNK> old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near or a her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion <UNK> because she never could get over the <UNK> fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her <UNK> because drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his <UNK> an <UNK> he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle <UNK> in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat <UNK> all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill <UNK> to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was <UNK> young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don <UNK> de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the <UNK> and the <UNK> till I taught him <UNK> he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the <UNK> near <UNK> tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail <UNK> all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of <UNK> farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and <UNK> and those frightful rocks and Saint <UNK> cave with the <UNK> or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud <UNK> my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the <UNK> boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the <UNK> there I was leaning over him with my white <UNK> hat to take the <UNK> out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child <UNK> that old servant <UNK> told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the <UNK> but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with <UNK> theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I <UNK> the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel <UNK> <UNK> his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all <UNK> men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the <UNK> I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from <UNK> Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old <UNK> and the jews <UNK> pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S <UNK> swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or <UNK> does <UNK> or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs <UNK> or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had <UNK> <UNK> the fun we had running along <UNK> road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the <UNK> those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the <UNK> that Sunday morning with captain <UNK> that was dead <UNK> like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the <UNK> mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap <UNK> <UNK> that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a <UNK> he gave me that clumsy <UNK> ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the <UNK> shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face <UNK> <UNK> that train again weeping tone once in the dear <UNK> days <UNK> call close my eyes breath my lips forward kiss sad look eyes open piano ere <UNK> the world the <UNK> began I hate that <UNK> comes loves sweet <UNK> Ill let that out full when I get in front of the footlights again Kathleen Kearney and her lot of <UNK> Miss This Miss That Miss <UNK> lot of <UNK> <UNK> around talking about politics they know as much about as my backside

theyd die down dead off their feet if ever they got a chance of walking down the Alameda on an officers arm like me on the <UNK> my eyes flash my bust that they havent passion God help their poor head I knew more about men and life when I was than theyll all know at they dont know how to sing a song like that Gardner said no man could look at my mouth and teeth smiling like that and not think of it I was afraid he <UNK> like my accent first he so English all father left me in spite of his stamps Ive my mothers eyes and figure anyhow he always said theyre so <UNK> about themselves some of those <UNK> he wasnt a bit like that he was dead gone on my lips let them get a husband first thats fit to be looked at and a daughter like mine or see if they can excite a swell with money that can pick and choose whoever he wants like Boylan to do it or times locked in each others arms or the voice either I could have been a prima donna only I married him comes <UNK> old deep down chin back not too much make it double My <UNK> <UNK> is too long for an encore about the <UNK> <UNK> at twilight and vaunted rooms yes Ill sing Winds that blow from the south that he gave after the <UNK> performance Ill change that lace on my black dress to show off my bubs and Ill yes by God Ill get that big fan <UNK> make them burst with envy my hole is itching me always when I think of him I feel I want to I feel some wind in me better go easy not wake him have him at it again slobbering after washing every bit of myself back belly and sides if we had even a bath itself or my own room anyway I wish hed sleep in some bed by himself with his cold feet on me give us room even to let a fart God or do the least thing better yes hold them like that a bit on my side piano quietly <UNK> theres that train far away <UNK> <UNK> one more song that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that <UNK> man in the <UNK> is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with <UNK> better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that <UNK> wind <UNK> across from those mountains the something <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand <UNK> and <UNK> only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to <UNK> about all night <UNK> money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon <UNK> and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she <UNK> shes as bad as a woman always licking and <UNK> but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some <UNK> with black currant jam like long ago not those lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for forgetting

or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and <UNK> mixed <UNK> there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann <UNK> out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing <UNK> about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his <UNK> slipping out of the <UNK> its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that <UNK> chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there <UNK> around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that <UNK> going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all <UNK> and tossed on me how <UNK> and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the <UNK> in <UNK> bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the <UNK> baskets old <UNK> near a hundred they said came from <UNK> and the tall old chap with the <UNK> I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a <UNK> or <UNK> private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon <UNK> by moonlight with the <UNK> and the lake of <UNK> he had a picture cut out of some paper of and <UNK> and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he <UNK> then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me <UNK> it like that picture of that <UNK> criminal he was called in <UNK> Weekly news years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet <UNK> out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to <UNK> academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he <UNK> and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the <UNK> all day put her in a <UNK> with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little <UNK> statue with her <UNK> and <UNK> before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for shillings wouldnt even <UNK> the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those <UNK> of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the <UNK> and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I <UNK> on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last <UNK> too split in halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle <UNK> and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great <UNK> too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to <UNK> up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for <UNK> <UNK> in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her <UNK> every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit <UNK> I think I saw him after trying to get near two <UNK> ladies outside <UNK> window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that <UNK> Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with <UNK> though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a <UNK> of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes <UNK> knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a <UNK> when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with <UNK> the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that <UNK> of course <UNK> I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the <UNK> I was just like that myself they <UNK> order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us <UNK> here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old <UNK> <UNK> that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a <UNK> with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody <UNK> him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the <UNK> mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to <UNK> around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and <UNK> he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that <UNK> the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us days every or weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply <UNK> that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of <UNK> in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed <UNK> I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced times over a daub of red ink would do or <UNK> juice no thats too purply O <UNK> let me up out of this <UNK> sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great <UNK> the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair <UNK> when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could <UNK> it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a <UNK> of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a <UNK> easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at <UNK> who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for <UNK> diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and <UNK> getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little <UNK> her vagina and her <UNK> theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an <UNK> odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I <UNK> it all over his <UNK> old face for him with all my <UNK> I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my <UNK> one everything connected with your glorious Body everything <UNK> that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself and times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being <UNK> looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half <UNK> smile on him and all the <UNK> said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his <UNK> about home rule and the land league sending me that long <UNK> of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more <UNK> O beau pays de la <UNK> that I never even sang once explaining and <UNK> about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an <UNK> sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he <UNK> down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a <UNK> lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our <UNK> both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his <UNK> mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world <UNK> ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord <UNK> that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says <UNK> Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it <UNK> and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our <UNK> or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by <UNK> lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and <UNK> Irish he is indeed <UNK> by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres <UNK> church bells wait quarters the hour wait two <UNK> well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know <UNK> men all their pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the <UNK> Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old <UNK> or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of <UNK> theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man <UNK> as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be <UNK> so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that <UNK> I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the <UNK> with the <UNK> I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that <UNK> spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his <UNK> let us into by the back way he was throwing his <UNK> eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little <UNK> man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two <UNK> and Fanny <UNK> husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the <UNK> as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that <UNK> he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his <UNK> because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he <UNK> down their gullets and looks after his wife and family <UNK> poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and children going to do unless he was insured <UNK> little <UNK> always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the <UNK> to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a <UNK> childs <UNK> didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his <UNK> and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn <UNK> he was always on for <UNK> too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy <UNK> private opera he had a delicious glorious voice <UNK> dearest goodbye sweetheart sweet heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm <UNK> O Maritana <UNK> flower we sang <UNK> though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats years ago now yes hed be though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the <UNK> too ticking in the wall of course he <UNK> hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord <UNK> suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the th card after that the of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the queens and the of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and red s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait I was married Milly is yesterday what age was he then at Dillons or about I suppose hes or more Im not too old for him if hes or I hope hes not that <UNK> university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking <UNK> cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the <UNK> from <UNK> the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy <UNK> ad and <UNK> ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand <UNK> from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in a minute even if some of it went down what its only like <UNK> or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the st thing in the morning till I see if the <UNK> comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half <UNK> under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the <UNK> that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that <UNK> way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old <UNK> in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those <UNK> saying passing the <UNK> of <UNK> lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt <UNK> hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be <UNK> me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes <UNK> anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even <UNK> a nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a <UNK> nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where <UNK> know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those <UNK> <UNK> in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that <UNK> fellow with the fine eyes <UNK> a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of <UNK> listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great <UNK> Don <UNK> de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be <UNK> around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and <UNK> when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and <UNK> it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual <UNK> house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that <UNK> me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little <UNK> jacket I <UNK> crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the <UNK> about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of <UNK> around the city meeting God knows who <UNK> and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to <UNK> none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so <UNK> Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber <UNK> what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar <UNK> <UNK> they had the devils queer names there father <UNK> of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary <UNK> y <UNK> in the Calle las <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and Mrs <UNK> in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and <UNK> ramp and <UNK> ramp and <UNK> ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a <UNK> I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish <UNK> esta usted <UNK> bien <UNK> y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a <UNK> is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel <UNK> Mrs Rubio lent me by <UNK> with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the <UNK> and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in <UNK> I could do the <UNK> the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he
